"Induction of suppressor T cells and inhibition of contact hypersensitivity in mice by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and its analogs. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and its analogs were surveyed for their abilities to modify contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses in SENCAR mice. Sensitization of dorsal skin with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and subsequent challenge of the ear 5 d later resulted within 24 h in ear swelling and increased vascular permeability (as measured by the extravasation of Evans Blue dye). Treatment of dorsal or ventral skin with TPA 4 times (application made every 3 or 4 d) prior to sensitization on the dorsum inhibited subsequent induction of CHS by DNFB challenge. Maximum suppression of CHS required sensitization at the site of TPA treatment. Suppression occurred over a narrow dose range of TPA (0.1-1.0 micrograms), and qualitatively correlated with the tumor incidences scored in an initiation-promotion multistage skin carcinogenesis experiment. Multiple applications (4x) of the promoters phorbol-12,13-dibenzoate (10 micrograms) and mezerein (2 micrograms) also suppressed CHS, whereas the non-promoter phorbol (20 micrograms) and the first stage tumor promoter 4-O-methyl TPA (20 micrograms) had no effect. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes isolated from mice pre-treated with TPA prior to DNFB sensitization inhibited the development of CHS in recipient mice that were sensitized and challenged with DNFB, but not oxazolone. Splenocyte preparations depleted of T lymphocytes prior to transfer could not suppress CHS in recipient mice. Conversely, suppressive activity was concentrated in splenocyte preparations depleted of adherent cells/monocytes. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that TPA treatment of murine epidermis prior to sensitization with hapten can inhibit subsequent hapten-dependent elicitation of CHS. This suppression is mediated in part by antigen-specific suppressor T cells. Furthermore, there is a qualitative correlation between the complete and second stage in vivo tumor-promoting activities of TPA and its analogs, and their abilities to inhibit CHS.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Analysis of IL-1 and TNF-alpha gene expression in human rheumatoid synoviocytes and normal monocytes by in situ hybridization. Human IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha mRNA expression was examined in peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) from normal individuals and in primary synoviocytes isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis by Northern blot and in situ hybridization. Cells cultured in the presence or absence of LPS were analyzed using in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled sense or antisense RNA probes to determine the relative abundance and the cell type expressing each of the mRNA for these potent inflammatory mediators. The results indicated that 72% of the LPS-stimulated PBM expressed detectable levels of IL-1 alpha mRNA, 89% IL-1 beta mRNA, and 10% TNF-alpha transcripts. Thus, the majority of activated PBM produced both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Experiments combining immunofluorescence for IL-1 beta protein with in situ hybridization for TNF-alpha mRNA demonstrated that monocytes expressing TNF-alpha mRNA also produced IL-1 beta. Primary synoviocytes from four patients with RA were also examined for the mRNA expression of each cytokine. Northern blot analyses of total RNA isolated from 0 to 72 h after LPS- or mock-stimulation showed that IL-1 beta mRNA was the most abundantly expressed, followed by TNF-alpha. In situ hybridization revealed that IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha transcripts were detected exclusively in synovial tissue macrophages. IL-1 alpha mRNA was not detected in these cultures by either method.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione: a marker of adrenal function in hirsutism. To assess the role of the adrenal glands in the development of hirsutism, levels of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione (11 beta-OHA), 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione (delta 4A), and free and total testosterone (T) were measured in 63 hirsute females and 30 control patients. Six of the hirsute patients had basal levels of 11 beta-OHA and 17-OHP and responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone that were significantly greater than these values in controls and the other hirsute women. These women were designated as having an adrenal source for their hirsutism. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and idiopathic hirsutism had normal values of 11 beta-OHA and 17-OHP. Levels of total and free T, DHEAS and delta 4A were significantly higher than control values in all of the hirsute women. This study demonstrates that 11 beta-OHA can be used as a marker to assess the adrenal contribution to hirsutism.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Early treatment with acyclovir for varicella pneumonia in otherwise healthy adults: retrospective controlled study and review. The effect of early acyclovir therapy on the course of varicella pneumonia in previously healthy adults was assessed. Medical records from five university-affiliated medical centers were retrospectively reviewed; included were all immunocompetent adults with a clinical diagnosis of primary varicella, a chest radiograph consistent with varicella pneumonia, and an arterial blood gas measurement indicating significant hypoxia. Of the 38 patients who met the study criteria, 11 had had a course of intravenous acyclovir initiated within the first 36 hours of hospitalization; the mean time from admission to initiation of therapy in this early-treatment group was 9.6 hours. The group that received early acyclovir treatment had a lower mean temperature beginning on the fifth day of hospitalization (37.0 degrees C vs. 37.7 degrees C; P = .011) and a lower mean respiratory rate beginning on the sixth day of hospitalization (21 vs. 28 respirations per minute; P = .004). Early acyclovir therapy also resulted in a significant improvement in oxygenation beginning on the sixth day of hospitalization in patients with follow-up arterial blood gas measurements (P = .035). Thus, early institution of acyclovir therapy is associated with reduction in fever and tachypnea and improvement in oxygenation in otherwise healthy adults with varicella pneumonia.",Virus_Diseases
"Reoperative versus conservative management for gastrointestinal fistulas. Development of a fistula is a serious complication. It is necessary to identify its anatomic and pathologic features, as these can influence the outcome of treatment independent of the primary disease. Electrolyte abnormalities should be addressed as volume deficits are being restored. Sepsis, the most common cause of death in patients with fistulas, must be controlled, and the skin must be protected. Reoperation and conservative management are not opposing forms of therapy but rather are complementary.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Deficiency of calcitonin gene-related peptide in Raynaud's phenomenon. Skin biopsy samples from the fingers of nine patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, nine with the disorder associated with systemic sclerosis, and eleven healthy controls were examined by immunocytochemistry. There were no differences between the groups in the distribution of PGP 9.5 (a pan-neuronal marker) immunoreactivity, but there was a significant reduction in the number of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactive neurons in the skin of patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and those with systemic sclerosis. These findings implicate dysfunction of the CGRP neurovascular axis in the pathophysiology of Raynaud's phenomenon.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Intraosseous lipomatosis. A case report. We report a case of systemic intraosseous lipomatosis involving the proximal femur, both ends of the tibia, and the tarsal and metatarsal bones. The lesions progressed during a five-year follow-up with a pathological fracture of the tibial plateau. CT scans were characteristic and helpful in diagnosis but MR imaging added little information. Intraosseous lipomatosis is a hamartomatous malformation due to hyperplasia of adipose tissue, and is fundamentally different from solitary benign intraosseous lipoma. Management involves reconstruction of any pathological fracture. Large progressive lesions should be treated by curettage and grafting in an attempt to prevent such fractures.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Urological aspects of Behcet's disease. Behcet's disease, affecting mostly young males in the Mediterranean countries and Japan, is a multi-system disease with urological manifestations. In this prospective study of 100 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Behcet's disease, we found that 89% of the males had experienced scrotal ulceration and 6% had epididymitis. We also observed sterile urethritis in 3%. Other urological abnormalities appeared to be coincidental findings.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Depression, distress, lymphocyte subsets, and human immunodeficiency virus symptoms on two occasions in HIV-positive homosexual men. We evaluated the extent to which depressive disorders, psychiatric distress, and psychosocial stressors are related to three measures of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) illness, both cross-sectionally and during a 6-month period, in a community sample of 124 HIV-positive homosexual men. The dependent variables are immune status measured by CD4 and CD8 cell subsets, number of signs and symptoms commonly associated with HIV infection, and a cumulative index of HIV illness stage. We chose to focus on CD4 cell count because it is the immune marker most closely linked to the clinical consequences of HIV infection. We found no relationships between the independent variables and immune status or illness stage. The HIV-positive men who were depressed or distressed or who reported more life stressors had no greater immunosuppression or more advanced illness stage than did the others, either concurrently or across occasions. We did find a suggestive pattern of association between depressive disorders, distress, and stressors and the number of HIV-related symptoms, which warrants further study.",Virus_Diseases
"A human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG) promotes recovery from acute diarrhea in children. To determine the effect of a human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG, Gefilac) on recovery from acute diarrhea (82% rotavirus), 71 well-nourished children between 4 and 45 months of age were studied. After oral rehydration, the patients randomly received either Lactobacillus GG-fermented milk product, 125 g (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 1); Lactobacillus GG freeze-dried powder, one dose (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 2); or a placebo, a pasteurized yogurt (group 3) 125 g twice daily; each diet was given for 5 days, in addition to normal full diet otherwise free of fermented dairy products. The mean (SD) duration of diarrhea after commencing the therapy was significantly shorter in group 1 (1.4 [0.8] days) and in group 2 (1.4 [0.8] days) than in group 3 (2.4 [1.1] days); F = 8.70, P less than 0.001. After rehydration, each dietary group maintained a positive weight trend. The urinary lactulose-mannitol recovery ratios (means [95% confidence intervals]) on admission were 0.09 (0.03, 0.24) in group 1, 0.12 (0.07, 0.22) in group 2, and 0.08 (0.04, 0.18) in group 3; no significant alterations in intestinal permeability were observed at retesting after 2 days of realimentation. The result indicates that early nutritional repletion after rehydration causes no mucosal disruption and is beneficial for recovery from diarrhea. It is further suggested that Lactobacillus GG in the form of fermented milk or freeze-dried powder is effective in shortening the course of acute diarrhea.",Virus_Diseases
"Changes in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid in acute viral hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice. Forty-four male and female subjects aged 22-57 years were studied. Thirteen patients had acute viral hepatitis, and eleven patients had cholestatic jaundice due to carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Twenty healthy volunteers who served as controls were also included. In hepatitis patients, the mean plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-phospholipid/phospholipid (HDLPL/PL) ratio were reduced, and HDL-cholesterol (HDLC), HDL-phospholipid (HDLPL) and the phospholipid/total cholesterol (PL/TC) ratio were normal, while total phospholipid (PL) levels and the HDLC/TC ratio were significantly increased compared to the control values. In patients with cholestatic jaundice the mean plasma total cholesterol, phospholipid and HDLC levels were elevated, and HDLPL/PL, HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC remained normal compared to the control values. A comparison within the patient groups showed that plasma TC, PL and HDLC levels were significantly increased in cholestatic jaundice when compared with the corresponding levels in hepatitis patients. The mean plasma levels of HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC did not show any significant variation within the patient groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) correlated positively with TC, and total protein correlated negatively with TC and HDLPL, while albumin correlated negatively with TC, HDLC and HDLPL in cholestatic jaundice. Alanine amino-transferase (ALAT) also correlated positively with PL in cholestatic jaundice, while albumin correlated positively with TC in hepatitis. The results suggest that lipoproteins might be metabolized differently in these two forms of cholestasis.",Virus_Diseases
"Plasmodium Falciparum malaria and perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in Kinshasa, Zaire. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 587 children. BACKGROUND. It is uncertain whether Plasmodium falciparum malaria is more frequent or more severe in children with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and whether P. falciparum infection accelerates the progression of HIV-related disease. METHODS. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal cohort study in Kinshasa, Zaire. Two hundred sixty children 5 to 9 months of age who had been born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and 327 children of the same age who had been born to seronegative mothers were monitored intensively for malaria over a 13-month period. All episodes of fever were evaluated with blood smears for malaria, and children found to be infected with P. falciparum were treated with a standard regimen of oral quinine. RESULTS. A total of 2899 fevers were evaluated, with 271 cases of malaria identified. No statistically significant differences were found in the incidence, severity, or response to therapy of malaria among four well-defined groups of children: those with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), those who were HIV-1-seropositive throughout the study, those who were born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers but reverted to seronegative, and those who were seronegative throughout the study. During the 13-month period the incidence of malaria in the 36 children with HIV infection in whom AIDS developed was lower, although not significantly so, than in the 37 in whom AIDS did not. CONCLUSIONS. In this study malaria was not more frequent or more severe in children with progressive HIV-1 infection and malaria did not appear to accelerate the rate of progression of HIV-1 disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Management of aortic insufficiency in chronic aortic dissection. From January 1980 to December 1988, 44 patients with chronic aortic dissection and aortic insufficiency underwent operation. This group of patients was analyzed to evaluate the outcome of those in whom the aortic valve was preserved compared with those having valve replacement. The overall preoperative characteristics of the two groups were similar except for the incidence of Marfan's syndrome. Valve replacement was the elected procedure in patients with valve degeneration or annuloaortic ectasia. In patients with leaflet prolapse with or without an enlarged annulus, a plastic procedure was used. In 48% of the patients, it was possible to preserve the valve. There were five hospital deaths (11%): three were due to low-output syndrome, one was due to bleeding, and one was due to neurological complications. There were two late deaths (5%). Follow-up of the 37 surviving patients ranged from 2 to 108 months (mean follow-up, 18 months). Seventy-eight percent of the survivors were in functional class I and the others were in class II. Two patients in whom the aortic valve was preserved had mild aortic insufficiency. Three patients with bioprostheses underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve dysfunction. One patient who had aortoplasty and an aortic valve plastic procedure was seen with redissection and aortic insufficiency after 60 months and was reoperated on using the Bentall technique. The actuarial survival curves showed that patients who underwent valvoplasty had higher, but not significantly higher, survival rates than the valve replacement patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Immunogenicity of tetravalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine administered with buffer and oral polio vaccine. Between January and November 1989, we studied 174 infants aged 6 to 16 weeks in a randomized clinical trial to (1) determine the immunogenicity of a single dose of tetravalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine (RRV-TV) when administered with three different buffer regimens: no antacid buffer and small-volume (2.5-mL) and large-volume (30-mL) antacid buffer; and (2) examine the potential interference of RRV-TV on the immune response to oral polio vaccine. Immunogenicity of RRV-TV, measured as a fourfold rise in antibody titers to rotavirus, was similar in the groups receiving small- and large-dose buffer (45% and 49%, respectively) and significantly less in the group that received RRV-TV alone (23%). Administration of RRV-TV with oral polio vaccine did not significantly interfere with the neutralization response of oral polio vaccine poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, or 3, and overall, 29%, 87%, and 24% of the infants had a fourfold rise in titer to each serotype, respectively.",Virus_Diseases
"Determinants of genital human papillomavirus infection in young women  Carcinoma of the cervix has several well-established epidemiologic risk factors, including multiple sexual partners and early age at first intercourse. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to have an etiologic role in the development of cervical neoplasia, but evidence linking HPV infection to known risk factors for cervical cancer has been inconsistent. The lack of expected correlations may be due to the inaccuracy of HPV assays previously used. A polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification method for the detection of HPV was used to investigate the determinants of genital HPV infection in a cross-sectional sample of 467 women attending a university health service. In contrast to studies using less accurate detection methods, the risk factors for HPV infection found here were consistent with those for cervical neoplasia. The risk of HPV infection was strongly and independently associated with increasing numbers of sexual partners in a lifetime, use of oral contraceptives, younger age, and black race. Age at first intercourse, smoking, and history of a prior sexually transmitted disease were correlated with, but not independently predictive of, HPV infection. These results demonstrate that the key risk factors for cervical carcinoma are strongly associated with genital HPV infection. This correlation suggests that HPV has an etiologic role in cervical neoplasia and reaffirms the sexual route of HPV transmission.",Virus_Diseases
"Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study of histiocytosis X and non-X histiocytoses. The diagnostic reliability of ultrastructural and immunohistochemical examinations on routinely processed biopsy specimens of cutaneous histiocytic proliferations (histiocytosis X, n = 7; juvenile xanthogranuloma, n = 4; necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, n = 2; traumatic granuloma of the tongue, n = 1) was evaluated. S-100 protein, peanut agglutinin, and the antibody Mac-387 were used as markers for histiocytes. The frequency of Birbeck granule-containing cells in seven histiocytosis X lesions did not correspond with the number of S-100+ or peanut agglutinin+ cells. All neoplastic histiocytosis X cells were positive for S-100 protein and peanut agglutinin but were negative for Mac-387. Histiocytes of juvenile xanthogranuloma, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, and traumatic granuloma were strongly positive for Mac-387 but were negative for S-100 protein and peanut agglutinin, except for the peanut agglutinin-reactive Touton giant cells. Mac-387 reliably differentiates histiocytic proliferations of the monocyte/macrophage system from those of the dendritic cell system. For the diagnosis of histiocytosis X, both S-100 protein and peanut agglutinin positivity in histiocytes is as reliable as ultrastructural demonstration of Birbeck granules.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Cytokines in chronic inflammatory arthritis. VI. Analysis of the synovial cells involved in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor production and gene expression in rheumatoid arthritis and its regulation by IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) is a potent stimulator of macrophages and neutrophils and is produced by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium. We now report studies that identify some of the synovial cells and cytokines responsible for local GM-CSF production and gene expression in RA. GM-CSF was assayed by ELISA in supernatants from cultured RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes stimulated with various cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, macrophage-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and TGF-beta). Immunoreactive GM-CSF was detected in IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha-stimulated cultures, but not in cells cultured in medium or stimulated with any of the other cytokines. IL-1 and TNF-alpha had a synergistic effect on GM-CSF production. GM-CSF gene expression by fibroblast-like synoviocytes was analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay, Northern blot analysis, and in situ hybridization. Both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha induced GM-CSF mRNA accumulation, with a maximum effect after 4 h of stimulation. We then studied GM-CSF production by macrophage-like synoviocytes (MLS) isolated from fresh synovial specimens by flow microfluorimetry. Fresh MLS spontaneously secreted the cytokine and exogenous IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha had no effect. After 1 wk in culture, additional stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha was required for GM-CSF production. Finally, in situ hybridization performed on freshly isolated subpopulations of synovial cells, identified GM-CSF RNA transcripts in MLS.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Field evaluation of alternative HIV testing strategy with a rapid immunobinding assay and an agglutination assay. A rapid immunobinding assay ('HIVCHEK', Ortho) and an agglutination assay ('Serodia-HIV', Fujirebio) were evaluated as an alternative to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot under field conditions in Africa for detection of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 7106 specimens were tested at 25 laboratories in Kenya, Ghana, Senegal, and Zaire. HIVCHEK was used as a screening test, and serodia-HIV as a supplemental test to evaluate these assays in an alternative testing strategy to the standard ELISA/western blot testing procedure. In each country, HIVCHEK was more sensitive and specific than ELISA when compared with western blot. The sensitivity of HIVCHEK ranged from 87.0 to 96.3% and the specificity from 99.0 to 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of serodia-HIV ranged from 85 to 98% and from 88 to 98%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were affected by the presence of HIV-2 in Ghana and Senegal. Overall, with an HIV-1 prevalence of 14.8% in Kenya and 22.5% in Zaire, the sensitivities of the alternative strategy were 96.4% and 91.4%, the specificities 99.6% and 100%, the positive predictive values 97.6% and 100%, and the negative predictive values 99.3% and 97.9% for Kenya and Zaire, respectively. With this testing format there was an estimated average cost saving of up to 82% over the conventional strategy with ELISA/western blot. This procedure constitutes a reasonable alternative to the standard ELISA/western blot combination.",Virus_Diseases

"A pilot study of low-dose zidovudine in human immunodeficiency virus infection  BACKGROUND. Zidovudine delays the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but is associated with hematologic toxicity at high doses. Regimens are needed that preserve or enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity. Acyclovir has been reported to potentiate the effect of zidovudine on HIV in vitro. METHODS. We conducted a Phase II open-label, dose-escalating trial to evaluate the clinical and antiviral effects of zidovudine at low (300 mg daily, 28 subjects), medium (600 mg, 24 subjects), and high (1500 mg, 15 subjects) doses, either with or without acyclovir (4.8 g) by random assignment. The subjects had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex, but not AIDS. All of them had either HIV p24 antigenemia or plasma viremia and CD4-lymphocyte counts of 200 to 500 per cubic millimeter when they began treatment. RESULTS. Performance scores and fatigue improved the most in the low- and medium-dose zidovudine groups (both P less than or equal to 0.025). Those assigned to low-dose zidovudine gained the most weight and had the greatest improvement in the mean CD4-lymphocyte count (from 321 per cubic millimeter at base line to 412 per cubic millimeter after 12 weeks, P = 0.01). The proportion of subjects in whom HIV antigenemia resolved, the decrease in the level of antigenemia, and the reduction in the plasma virus titers were similar at all three doses. Subjects assigned to receive the low or medium dose who subsequently crossed over to the 1500-mg dose (n = 19) did not have an increase in CD4-cell counts or a decline in levels of HIV antigen, but they did have dose-related toxicity. The addition of acyclovir to zidovudine was well tolerated, but it did not enhance any of zidovudine's antiretroviral effects. CONCLUSIONS. In this pilot study a very low dose of zidovudine (300 mg) had clinical and virologic effects similar to those of higher daily doses (600 and 1500 mg). The minimal effective dose of zidovudine for the treatment of HIV infection has yet to be determined, and further studies of very low daily doses are warranted.",Virus_Diseases
"Tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome  Eight patients who became ill while taking tryptophan had myalgia, fatigue, rash, fever, edema, alopecia, arthralgias, diminished joint motion, skin tightening, muscle cramping, and distal paresthesias. Three had shortness of breath, and one had pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory abnormalities included peripheral eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated serum levels of aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. Of 4 chest radiographs, 3 were abnormal. Of 5 skin and muscle biopsies, 4 showed sclerosis or mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the dermis, subcutis, and fascia. Eosinophils were often present, but vasculitis was absent. Muscle inflammation was minimal. We conclude that the ""eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome"" is related to the ingestion of tryptophan and that abnormalities in the secretion of lymphokines may be important in its pathogenesis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Cytomegalovirus infection in sexually active adolescents. To determine whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in teenage girls is related to sexual activity, 254 girls 12-18 years old (mean, 15.8) attending a contraceptive counseling clinic were studied. Participants were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis, and serum antibody to CMV was determined. Demographic and sexual history data were collected by interview. The mean number of lifetime sex partners was 2.2; 173 (68%) were seropositive. Race, greater than 3 years of sexual activity, and greater than 2 lifetime sex partners were significant risk factors for CMV infection (odds ratios [OR], 1.8-4.7; P less than .05). Using logistic regression analysis, a composite sexual activity variable was the most important risk factor for CMV infection (OR, 4.8; P = .003), followed by race (OR, 3.4; P = .004) and a sexually transmitted disease composite variable (OR, 2.4; P = .016).

"Signs of cognitive change in HIV disease: an event-related brain potential study. We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from 2 groups of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men with no physical illness or neurologic involvement: 9 asymptomatic (AS+) and 9 classified as having either acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS; 7) or AIDS-related complex (ARC; 2). In separate choice reaction time tasks, the subjects pressed buttons to randomly presented auditory or visual stimuli at probabilities of either 20/80 or 50/50. There were no group differences on any of the neuropsychological tests commonly used in screening batteries for HIV patients. In contrast, reduced P300 amplitudes and increased P300 latencies occurred in ARC/AIDS patients in response to both auditory and visual stimuli, while in AS+ patients such alterations occurred only in the visual modality. Significant delays in P2 latency were found only in the auditory modality and then only in ARC/AIDS patients. ARC/AIDS patients alone showed delayed response times, and only in the auditory modality. The P300 results demonstrate alterations in stimulus evaluation and processing speed in the earliest stages of HIV disease, even before cognitive deficits can be detected by more traditional measures.",Virus_Diseases
"End-stage renal disease--is infrainguinal limb revascularization justified? Reports of reconstructive surgery for peripheral vascular disease have been relatively uncommon in patients with end-stage renal disease. Between 1980 and 1989, 39 patients with end-stage renal disease underwent revascularization of 56 limbs. Fifty-two primary infrainguinal and four secondary infrainguinal bypass grafts were performed. In addition, nine thrombectomies were performed. At the time of surgery 37 patients were on dialysis; three had functioning kidney transplants. The indications for revascularization were gangrene, rest pain, or ulceration in all except three limbs with disabling claudication. Reversed, nonreversed, or in situ vein was used in 25 of the 52 primary infrainguinal revascularizations performed. Polytetrafluoroethylene was used in 25. Two procedures used a combination of polytetrafluoroethylene and vein. The primary patencies for all infrainguinal procedures at 1 and 2 years were 77% and 68%, respectively. Four perioperative deaths occurred in the infrainguinal group (7.7%). An additional death occurred after thrombectomy for late graft closure. Three deaths were a result of myocardial infarction. One patient on peritoneal dialysis developed uncontrolled sepsis. At 3 years 39% of patients were alive, and 84% of the limbs were salvaged. Among the cases studied no group was identified that represented unacceptable operative risk. Results compared well with reported patencies for patients subjected to infrainguinal revascularization procedures. Limb revascularization in patients with end-stage renal disease may be performed by use of similar criteria to those used for other patients with peripheral vascular disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Should family physicians test for human papillomavirus infection? An opposing view. Recent advances in the field of molecular biology have expanded the knowledge of HPV manifestations. We have attempted to separate those circumstances when HPV testing may be useful in patient management and when it may not. Routine screening for HPV has not yet been shown to be useful. One must weigh informing 10% of patients that they have a potentially oncogenic virus against the ability of a repeat Papanicolaou smear to detect the lesion. On the other hand, HPV detection in the setting of an abnormal Papanicolaou smear and an acetowhite lesion that on biopsy lacks the histologic features of CIL does predict who is at high risk for CIL. HPV typing should not affect clinical management, and we do not recommend it. HPV detection by in situ hybridization is a very useful adjunct to histological analysis in genital tract lesions that are clinically suggestive of an HPV lesion but where the histological analysis is equivocal. This ability to distinguish true HPV lesions from its mimics is often crucial to the patient, given the implications of having a sexually transmitted disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Detection of the interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 in psoriasiform dermatitis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 is a 10-kd protein produced by human keratinocytes following an exposure to interferon gamma. Keratinocytes within psoriatic plaques and within delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been shown to stain strongly with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody prepared against interferon-gamma-induced protein 10, suggesting a possible role for interferon gamma in the production of the lesions. A psoriasiform eruption has been seen in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Its severity appears to correlate with the degree of immunodeficiency in the early stages of AIDS. We stained 10 lesions of psoriasiform dermatitis of AIDS with the anti-interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 antibody using immunoperoxidase techniques. As controls, we studied 10 lesions of non-AIDS psoriasis, six lesions of seborrheic dermatitis with psoriasiform hyperplasia, one lesion of lichen simplex chronicus, and four biopsy specimens of normal skin from patients with AIDS. In addition, normal skin specimens taken from patients with AIDS and human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients at time of autopsy were examined. An identical, strong and diffuse staining pattern was seen in all cases of psoriasiform dermatitis of AIDS, non-AIDS psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and lichen simplex chronicus. The specimens of normal skin showed only weak basal layer staining with anti-interferon-gamma-induced protein 10. Thus, the presence of interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 in keratinocytes was associated with psoriasiform hyperplasia and could be detected in both AIDS-associated and classic psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Fulminant childhood hemophagocytic syndrome mimicking histiocytic medullary reticulosis. An atypical form of Epstein-Barr virus infection. Ten cases of pediatric fulminant hemophagocytic syndrome, encountered between 1986 and 1989, are described. They occurred in the summer, and the patients presented with fever, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and abnormal liver function. Bone marrow studies revealed infiltration by atypical T-lymphoid cells, rare B immunoblasts, and mature histiocytes with hemophagocytosis. Initially, histiocytic medullary reticulosis was suspected in six cases. The clinical course was characterized by rapid deterioration, with a mean period of 16 days from onset of fever to death. The main causes of death were coagulopathy with multiple organ failure and opportunistic infection. In seven of eight cases studied by serologic assay and Southern blot hybridization, acute or active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was documented. It is suggested that an atypical or fulminant form of primary EBV infection distinct from classic infectious mononucleosis was prevalent in previously healthy children in Taiwan. Younger age involvement and seasonal clustering were characteristic of the disorder described.",Virus_Diseases

"On a possible protective effect of HLA-A11 against skin cancer and keratotic skin lesions in renal transplant recipients. Renal transplant recipients who have skin cancer potentially related to human papillomavirus were HLA typed with a special focus on HLA-A11, which in nonimmunosuppressed patients is negatively associated with the occurrence of virus-related carcinoma of the cervix. We found also a negative association between HLA-A11 and skin cancer; none of the 66 transplant recipients with skin cancer were positive for HLA-A11. As HLA-A11 seems to have a protective effect against skin cancer, we speculate that antigens induced by squamous cell carcinomas and possibly also by human papillomavirus may be efficiently presented through HLA-A11 to cytotoxic T cells. We also investigated a possible influence of other HLA alleles on the susceptibility of renal transplant recipients to skin cancer. The frequency of HLA-B27 was significantly higher in the transplant recipients with skin cancer, with a relative risk of 3.4 relative to healthy controls. No significant differences were found for other HLA class I or class II antigens.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"DNA image cytometry of keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The distinction between the keratoacanthoma (KA) and the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can sometimes be difficult on the basis of histologic and clinical criteria. The possible diagnostic significance of DNA ploidy initiated the present study evaluating the DNA ploidy in paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 7 KA and 15 SCC, and fresh frozen tissue touch preparations of 15 of the same cases using the CAS 200 Image Analyzer. In paraffin-embedded tissue sections the main peak DNA index was based on normal epidermis, and ranged from 1.03 to 1.59 in KA and from 1.47-2.71 in SCC. The DNA Index (DI) discriminated KA from SCC in 17 of 22 cases (p less than 0.0007). The highest DNA content of single nuclei ranged from 9.0-18.0 picograms (pg) (DI 2.9-6.03) in KA and 14.8-38.6 pg (DI 4.0-11.03) in SCC. The highest DNA content discriminated KA from SCC in 16 of 22 cases (p less than 0.003). In fresh frozen tissue touch preparations from 15 of the same lesions, there was considerable overlap in DNA indices of KA (0.534-1.39) and SCC (0.464-1.41). Abnormal DNA peaks seen in histograms from three SCC in paraffin-embedded tissue sections were lost in the touch preparation histograms, probably due to inadequate sampling. Therefore, image analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue sections is better able to distinguish KA from SCC than touch preparations.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dengue fever. Twenty-six virologically and serologically confirmed Dengue patients with signs of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding (13.1%) were studied during the 1987 outbreak in southern Taiwan. Within a 1-yr period from 1987 to 1988 in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, there were 198 patients with Dengue fever confirmed. Viral isolation and serological studies indicated that type I Dengue was the cause. There was no evidence of sequential secondary infection among them. The 26 patients were evaluated gastroduodenoscopically. Most of the Dengue patients who developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding had gastric ulcers or duodenal ulcers; superficial and hemorrhagic gastritis are the other relevant endoscopic findings. Thirteen patients (50%) had a past history of peptic ulcer symptoms, whereas the other 13 did not. Dengue infection is a precipitating factor in inducing peptic ulcer bleeding because of hemostatic derangements. Supportive therapy and blood transfusions alone were adequate treatment, except for one patient who required surgery due to massive bleeding of a duodenal ulcer. No mortality was observed in this study.",Virus_Diseases

Other causes of vulvar ulcers, such as venereal disease, chronic bullous and autoimmune diseases, and neoplastic conditions were excluded. We treated the patient with systemic antihistamines, topical antiseptics and corticosteroids, and sublesional injections of triamcinolone.

"An HIV-1 and HIV-2 cross-reactive cytotoxic T-cell epitope. The HLA-B27-restricted HIV gag cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope, 265-279, is highly conserved amongst HIV-1 isolates, only one, HIV-1ELI, having a single amino acid substitution. Over the same region HIV-2 differs by five amino acids. As a broadly cross-protective AIDS vaccine should protect against infection from all isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2, we tested CTL specific for the HIV-1 265-279 epitope with peptide analogues from HIV-1ELI, HIV-2 and two simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates, and with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the respective gag genes, to determine whether there was any cross-reactivity for this CTL epitope. CTL from the HIV-1-infected donor could recognize the HIV-1ELI peptide, the HIV-2 peptide and recombinant vaccinia virus-infected target and one of the two SIV peptide-treated targets. Epitopes that exhibit such cross-reactivity may be valuable in vaccine design.",Virus_Diseases
"Sequential cerebrospinal fluid and plasma sampling in humans: 24-hour melatonin measurements in normal subjects and after peripheral sympathectomy. Simultaneous measurements of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) melatonin and urinary excretion of 6-hydroxymelatonin were performed in four normal volunteers and one patient before and after upper thoracic sympathectomy for the control of essential hyperhidrosis. For normal individuals, hourly 24-h melatonin concentrations in plasma and CSF exhibited similar profiles, with low levels during the day and high levels at night. Peak plasma levels varied from 122-660 pmol/L, and the peak CSF levels from 94-355 pmol/L. The onset of the nocturnal increase in melatonin did not occur at the same time for each individual. Urinary 6-hydroxymelatonin levels also exhibited a daily rhythm, with peak excretion at night. The individual with the lowest nocturnal levels of circulating melatonin also had the lowest excretion of 6-hydroxymelatonin. In the patient with hyperhidrosis, a prominent melatonin rhythm was observed preoperatively in the CSF and plasma. After bilateral T1-T2 ganglionectomy, however, melatonin levels were markedly reduced, and the diurnal rhythm was abolished. These results provide direct evidence in humans for a diurnal melatonin rhythm in CSF and plasma as well as regulation of this rhythm by sympathetic innervation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"HIV prevalence in a midwestern emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity of patients 15 years of age and older in our emergency department. DESIGN: HIV status was determined anonymously, and the seroprevalence rate was calculated. The 95% confidence intervals also were calculated. Twenty demographic and predictor categorical variable were cross-tabulated with HIV status to determine associations. Only gender and male homosexual preference were significantly associated by Fisher's exact test. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Excess serum samples from 454 randomly selected patients 15 years of age and older who required venipuncture for their ED evaluation were included in the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 454 serum specimens, six (1.32%) were positive for HIV. The 95% confidence interval was from 0.27% to 2.37%. All six positive patients were men. The only statistically significant risk factors associated with HIV seropositivity were male sex (P = .00112) and male homosexual preference (P = .0000).

"Vesicoureteric reflux and renal injury. Renal injury associated with the intrarenal reflux (IRR) of urine that is either infected, under high pressure, or both, is a major cause of severe hypertension during childhood and adolescence and of chronic renal insufficiency in patients less than 30 years of age. Many, but not all, adolescent and adult patients with reflux nephropathy (RN) give a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) or unexplained fevers in infancy or early childhood, when the kidney is thought to be at greatest risk of injury. Although vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is observed more commonly in infants than children with UTI, it is rare in uninfected patients at any age and should never be considered a normal finding during human development. Renal scarring may not be obvious in radiographic or radionuclear studies to medical management alone, no definite benefit of one over the other was observed, regardless of the grade of VUR. Moreover, progressive renal injury in scarred kidneys has been noted even after VUR had been corrected, when infection had been prevented, and while hypertension had been controlled satisfactorily. Focal glomerular sclerosis, a lesion found in patients with proteinuria and RN, has been identified not only in scarred kidneys, but also may be seen in contralateral, unscarred kidneys without VUR, which might suggest a humoral factor or, perhaps, a hyperfiltration phenomenon. RN is one of the most frequent causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in children, adolescents, and young adults, which is potentially preventable. However, prevention will depend on early identification of patients at risk--infants and young children after the first UTI and siblings of patients with VUR--aggressive and effective treatment of UTI, minimizing intravesical pressure, and education of patients, parents, and physicians.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Activation pathways of synovial T lymphocytes. Expression and function of the UM4D4/CDw60 antigen. Accumulating evidence implicates a central role for synovial T cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, but the activation pathways that drive proliferation and effector function of these cells are not known. We have recently generated a novel monoclonal antibody against a rheumatoid synovial T cell line that recognizes an antigen termed UM4D4 (CDw60). This antigen is expressed on a minority of peripheral blood T cells, and represents the surface component of a distinct pathway of human T cell activation. The current studies were performed to examine the expression and function of UM4D4 on T cells obtained from synovial fluid and synovial membranes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory joint disease. The UM4D4 antigen is expressed at high surface density on about three-fourths of synovial fluid T cells and on a small subset of synovial fluid natural killer cells; in synovial tissue it is present on more than 90% of T cells in lymphoid aggregates, and on approximately 50% of T cells in stromal infiltrates In addition, UM4D4 is expressed in synovial tissue on a previously undescribed population of HLA-DR/DP-negative non-T cells with a dendritic morphology. Anti-UM4D4 was co-mitogenic for both RA and non-RA synovial fluid mononuclear cells, and induced IL-2 receptor expression. The UM4D4/CDw60 antigen may represent a functional activation pathway for synovial compartment T cells, which could play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Distribution and specific identification of papillomavirus major capsid protein epitopes by immunocytochemistry and epitope scanning of synthetic peptides. Monoclonal (MAbs) and polyclonal antibodies were produced against the major capsid protein of detergent-disrupted, purified bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1). The precise locations of the corresponding epitopes were identified by the reactivity of MAbs and selected polyclonal antibodies with synthetic, overlapping, hexameric peptides corresponding with 95% of the BPV-1 major capsid protein. The topography of these epitopes was determined by reactivity of antibodies with intact (conformational and nonconformational surface epitopes) and disrupted (external or internal nonconformational epitopes) BPV-1 virions. The distribution of epitopes in various papillomaviruses of 13 different species was determined by reactivity of the MAbs and polyclonal sera with productively infected, formalin-fixed papillomas, fibropapillomas, and fibromas. Epitope scanning, using MAbs and polyclonal antisera, resulted in the precise location of BPV-1 hexameric epitopes that could be correlated with their topography on the capsid and distribution in papillomatous lesions of various species.",Virus_Diseases
"The role of epidermal cytokines in inflammatory skin diseases. Cytokines (hormone-like polypeptide mediators) play a major role in inflammatory and immunoregulatory responses. Skin, and particularly keratinocytes in the skin, represent a potent source for many cytokines, including interleukins 1, 6, 8, and the hemopoietic colony stimulating factors. Cytokines initiate their biologic action by interacting with target cells bearing cytokine receptors and then initiating a cascade of cellular interactions. Certain inflammatory skin diseases have been associated with overproduction of cytokines, alteration in cytokine receptors, or dysregulation of cytokines. While data is still quite preliminary, it is likely that cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory skin diseases.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"UVABA therapy for psoriasis. Efficacy with shortened treatment times with the combined use of coal tar, anthralin, and metal halide ultraviolet machines. Rapid clearing of psoriasis in a psoriasis treatment center setting has been obtained with a combination of short-contact coal tar, phototherapy from high-pressure metal halide lamps (consisting of UVA and UVB), and short-contact high-potency anthralin therapy. These intensive 1 1/2- to 2-hour treatment sessions done three or four times weekly were as efficacious as reported responses to PUVA therapy or conventional psoriasis day care therapy. The treatment schedule allows minimal time away from work, decreased hours per week in contact with crude coal tar, shortened UV treatment times, decreased cost, and a low risk of side effects.

"Multidisciplinary baseline assessment of homosexual men with and without human immunodeficiency virus infection. III. Neurologic and neuropsychological findings. We explored the possibility that neurologic and neuropsychological changes constitute the earliest detectable manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Without knowledge of HIV status, we assessed neurologic signs and symptoms and administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to 208 homosexual men, of whom 84 were HIV negative, 49 were HIV positive and asymptomatic, 29 were mildly symptomatic, and 46 had significant medical symptoms but not the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. There was no difference between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive men in the frequency of neurologic signs or of defective or borderline performance on any neuropsychological test. However, HIV-positive men performed slightly but significantly worse than HIV-negative men on tests of verbal memory, executive function, and language. Similar results were obtained when comparisons were limited to HIV-positive medically asymptomatic and HIV-negative men. There was no degradation of neurologic status or neuropsychological performance across stages of HIV severity, but neurologic and neuropsychological summary scores correlated with CD4/CD8 ratios in the HIV-positive group. Ratings of neurologic signs and symptoms correlated with neuropsychological summary scores in the HIV-positive group only. Cognitive complaints were more frequent in the HIV-positive men; they correlated with actual test performance in the HIV-positive but not HIV-negative men.

"Antibodies against dengue viral proteins in primary and secondary dengue hemorrhagic fever. Antibodies against dengue viral proteins were demonstrated in sera from dengue-infected patients by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and enzyme immunoassay. Primary dengue cases showed low titers of IgG class antibodies to envelope (E) proteins and two non-structural proteins, NS3 and NS5, in sera collected during the convalescent phase. Secondary dengue- infected patients always demonstrated IgG antibodies to E proteins in sera collected during the acute phase, and high titers of IgG antibodies to many other proteins, including NS1, NS3, NS5, and C proteins in sera collected during the convalescent phase. Appearance of antibodies to E, NS3, and NS5 could be detected within five days after the onset of fever. These three dengue viral proteins and their corresponding antibodies may be involved in the immunopathologic mechanism underlying this disease.

"Speculations on the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis: T-cell violation of a keratinocyte sphere of influence. The thesis is advanced that the differences in antigen processing and presentation described for ""fresh"" and ""cultured"" Langerhans cells in vitro reflect similar differences between intraepidermal and intranodal Langerhans cells in vivo. The functional properties of Langerhans cells are dependent upon the microenvironment in which they reside; thus, intraepidermal Langerhans cells are under the influence of cytokines secreted by keratinocytes, whereas intranodal Langerhans cells come under the influence of lymphokines from T lymphocytes. It is speculated that a genetic lesion in psoriasis robs keratinocytes of their capacity to create an ""appropriate"" epidermal microenvironment. As a consequence, intraepidermal Langerhans cells adopt the functional program of intranodal cells. When ""uninvolved"" psoriatic skin receives a cutaneous challenge with antigen, Langerhans cells, by activating naive T cells in situ, unwittingly engender a microenvironment that is more appropriate to a lymph node. This skin becomes ""involved"" as it gradually acquires features associated with lymph nodes (such as high endothelial venules). And the derangement is further complicated by abnormalities of proliferation and differentiation among keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts as they respond to the inappropriate T-cell-derived lymphokines, giving rising to the typical, active psoriatic lesion.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"A ""Pap"" test for men? Male urethral smears as screening tool for detecting subclinical human papillomavirus infection. We have explored the potential of using immunoperoxidase staining and in situ DNA hybridization techniques to detect the HPV common antigen and HPV DNA (subtypes 6/11 and 16/18) in urethral smears obtained from men with no grossly visible urethral lesions, with or without HPV-related clinical history. A total of 91 such smears were studied of which 25 (27.5%) were positive for HPV antigen. Of the latter, 20 (80%) were positive for HPV 6/11 DNA, 3 (12%) were positive for HPV 16/18 DNA, one smear (4%) was positive for both, and one was negative for both. The technique of obtaining male urethral smears and immunostaining them for HPV antigen is simple, rapid, specific, and far more sensitive than conventional morphologic observations. Since antigen-positive cells are the source for spreading HPV infection, identifying individuals with such cells can help limit the spread of infection by alerting sexual partners, and also can be used to monitor the infectious status of the patient after therapy.

To further elucidate the magnitude and mechanism of these abnormalities in humans treated with foscarnet for opportunistic herpes virus infections, we analyzed anaerobic serum specimens and 24-h urine samples before and after single and multiple doses of iv foscarnet and performed a series of in vitro experiments with normal human serum and plasma.

Results of in vitro experiments showed a highly significant inverse linear relationship between foscarnet and ionized calcium concentrations, but no correlation between foscarnet and total calcium or phosphate concentration. Dialysis experiments suggested that the complexing of foscarnet with ionized calcium could be a cause of this ionized hypocalcemia. Physicians must be aware of this phenomenon and should measure serum ionized calcium during foscarnet therapy (preferably at the end of a foscarnet infusion) whenever neurological or cardiological abnormalities occur.",Virus_Diseases
"Pigmented postacne osteoma cutis in a patient treated with minocycline: report and review of the literature. Postacne osteoma cutis is a rare complication of acne vulgaris. If it occurs during a course of tetracycline or minocycline therapy, pigmented osteomas can occur as a result of tetracycline or minocycline bone complexes. We report a case of pigmented postacne osteoma cutis that developed after extensive acne surgery and a 2- to 3-month course of minocycline. Previously reported cases have been treated surgically, but our patient responded to 0.05% tretinoin cream, with transepidermal elimination of some osteomas.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Lymphocyte immunophenotypes among anti-HTLV-I/II-positive blood donors and recipients. The Transfusion Safety Study Group. The Transfusion Safety Study retrospectively screened a repository of serum specimens collected in late 1984-early 1985 to identify blood donors with antibody to human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) at that time. They and their recipients have been traced for additional HTLV studies. Immunophenotypic analyses of peripheral blood lymphocytes from nine anti-HTLV-positive recipients, assumed to be infected during or since late 1984, showed no significant changes from healthy controls. Evaluation of the immunophenotypes of the 48 donors, however, showed significant elevations in the absolute counts of the T-cell (CD2) and natural killer (CD56) populations, the T helper/inducer and suppressor/inducer subsets (CD4+ CD29+ and CD4+ CD45RA+), and changes in T-cell activation markers. Long-term but not recent HTLV infection appears to alter the T-cell immunophenotypic pattern. Both infection with HTLV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 are associated with a decreased CD2+ CD26+ count.",Virus_Diseases
"Clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of patients referred for evaluation of possible Kawasaki disease. United States Multicenter Kawasaki Disease Study Group. STUDY OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine those diseases that most often mimic Kawasaki disease (KD) in the United States. (2) To examine the physical findings and laboratory studies that influenced experienced clinicians to exclude the diagnosis of KD. (3) To compare epidemiologic features of patients with KD and patients referred for evaluation of possible KD in whom alternative diagnoses were established. DESIGN: Case comparison study. SETTING: Seven pediatric tertiary care centers. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 280 patients with KD and 42 comparison patients examined within the first 14 days after onset of fever. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: (1) Infectious diseases, particularly measles and group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, most closely mimicked KD and accounted for 35 (83%) of 42 patients in the comparison group. (2) The standard diagnostic clinical criteria for KD were fulfilled in 18 (46%) of 39 patients in whom other diagnoses were established. (3) Patients with KD were significantly less likely to have exudative conjunctivitis or pharyngitis, generalized adenopathy, and discrete intraoral lesions, and more likely to have a perineal distribution of their rash. The patients with KD were also more likely to have anemia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate; leukocyte count less than 10 X 10(3)/mm3 and platelet count less than 200 X 10(3)/mm3 were significantly less prevalent in patients with KD. (4) Residence within 200 yards of a body of water was more common among KD patients. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Measles and streptococcal infection should be excluded in patients examined for possible KD. (2) Laboratory studies that may be useful in discriminating patients with KD from those with alternative diagnoses include hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum alanine aminotransferase activity. (3) Residence near a body of water may be a risk factor for the development of KD.",Virus_Diseases
Fatal disseminated hemorrhagic toxoplasmic encephalitis as the initial manifestation of AIDS. A 28-year-old woman presented with progressive coma after being asymptomatic for 1 year after the demonstration of seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus and high serum immunoglobulin G toxoplasma titers. Computed tomographic scanning showed multiple rounded cerebral hemorrhages and massive cerebral edema. Postmortem examination disclosed Toxoplasma gondii cysts scattered throughout the brain. An overwhelming fatal toxoplasmosis associated with multiple cerebral hemorrhages may be the first presentation of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We raise the possibility that frequent neuroradiological monitoring may be indicated in asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with high immunoglobulin G toxoplasma titers.,Virus_Diseases

"Induction of interleukin-6 during human immunodeficiency virus infection. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a multifunctional cytokine produced in monocytes, fibroblasts, and other cell types, is induced by a variety of stimuli, including bacteria, viruses, and other cytokines. When normal monocyte cultures were exposed to a monocytotropic strain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HTLV-IIIBa-L, significant levels of IL-6 bioactivity were detected in the culture supernatants after 12 to 43 days of incubation, at a time when there was associated evidence of HIV production. Similarly, when normal monocyte cultures were cocultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-infected individuals, HIV replication in these cultures was associated with production of IL-6. In further studies, we determined that mean serum levels of IL-6 bioactivity were abnormally elevated in HIV-seropositive individuals with stage 1/2 infection (25.2 x/divided by 1.8 U/mL) and stage 3/4 infection (46.1 x/divided by 1.7 U/mL) when compared with normals (1.6 x/divided by 1.2 U/mL). In contrast mean serum IL-6 levels were not different from normal in stage 5/6 infection (2.7 x/divided by 1.6 U/mL). A selected group of 12 HIV-seropositive individuals (stages 1, 2, and 3) who harbored HIV capable of replicating in T cells but not in monocyte cultures had a mean serum IL-6 level of 5.3 U/mL (x/divided by 1.5), a value significantly lower (P less than .004) than that measured in control HIV-seropositive individuals infected with monocytropic HIV (39 x/divided by 1.9 U/mL). In addition, serum IL-6 levels in HIV-seropositive individuals (stages 1 through 6) correlated directly with serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (R = .74, P less than .001). Monocytes but not T cells are capable of a high level IL-6 production in vitro, and monocyte-derived IL-6 stimulates Ig production in activated B cells. Thus, HIV-seropositive individuals who often are infected with monocytotropic HIV and often display abnormally elevated serum IgG levels may exhibit these abnormalities as a consequence of abnormally elevated IL-6 levels induced by HIV.",Virus_Diseases
"Neuropeptides in psoriasis: an immunocytochemical and radioimmunoassay study. The present study examines the presence of neuropeptides in the skin and plasma of patients with psoriasis using the techniques of immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay. Immunocytochemistry failed to demonstrate differences in the pattern of neuropeptide innervation in psoriatic lesional skin when compared to normal skin. However, radioimmunoassay of skin biopsy extracts, both substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, were significantly elevated in psoriatic lesional skin when compared with both psoriatic non-lesional and normal control skin (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between the plasma levels of neuropeptides in psoriatic patients compared to those of control subjects, and no significant correlation among the plasma levels of neuropeptides with the surface area of involvement with psoriasis. The finding of elevated levels of substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in lesional psoriatic skin suggests that these peptides may be involved in the pathogenesis or maintenance of the psoriatic skin lesion and the development of safe and stable antagonists of these neuropeptides may have applications in the treatment of psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Human papillomavirus type 16 DNA in ocular and cervical swabs of women with genital tract condylomata. Human papillomavirus type 16 is associated with dysplasias and carcinomas of the conjunctiva and of the uterine cervix. To explore the relationship between cervical and ocular human papillomavirus infection, we examined DNA from bilateral limbal swabs and cervical swabs from 17 women (age range, 17 to 46 years; median, 31.7 years) with biopsy-proven human papillomavirus-related cervical dysplasia who had a normal ocular surface. Using polymerase chain reaction, we identified human papillomavirus 16 DNA in one or both eyes of 13 (76.5%) patients, six (46.2%) of whom had demonstrable human papillomavirus 16 DNA in cervical swabs as well. It thus appears that human papillomavirus 16 is present in the conjunctivae of some patients with human papillomavirus-related genital warts who have no ocular manifestations of infection. Although autoinoculation of conjunctiva may be the source of some ocular human papillomavirus, data suggest that other modes of transmission to the eye also exist. Additional study of the epidemiologic characteristics of ocular human papillomavirus, a widely prevalent virus known to be associated with dysplasias/atypias and cancer, is warranted.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Open preliminary clinical trial of clobetasol propionate ointment in adhesive paste for treatment of chronic oral vesiculoerosive diseases. Clobetasol propionate (Temovate), a novel high-potency topical corticosteroid, was used in open trial from 1987 to 1988 on 24 patients with persistent oral vesiculoerosive disease of at least 1 month's duration. Fourteen women and 10 men, ranging in age from 27 to 76 years (mean 48 years), participated. Nine patients had erosive lichen planus, one had benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, three had pemphigus vulgaris, seven had persistent major recurrent aphthous stomatitis, and four had chronic oral erythema multiforme. Fifteen patients had complete remission of signs and symptoms, seven had excellent response of signs and complete remission of symptoms, and two failed to respond. All other topical therapy was suspended before and during the study. All patients responded to two or three applications daily of medication. Side effects were minor and reversible, and included localized candidiasis (three patients), stomatopyrosis (two), and hypogeusia (one).

"Vulvar condylomas and squamous vestibular micropapilloma. Differences in appearance and response to treatment. A study of 37 women with typical condylomas and so-called squamous micropapilloma was undertaken to determine their response to systemic interferon and/or podophyllin treatment. Thirty lesions were classified as condylomas and 9 as squamous micropapillomas; two women had both lesions. Twenty-six (87%) of 30 condylomas responded, whereas only 1 (11%) of the 9 cases of micropapillomatosis showed a partial response (P less than .001) to podophyllin and/or interferon. Twenty-six biopsies from condylomas in which sufficient DNA was available for analysis contained human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences that hybridized to an HPV 6 + 16 probe mix under nonstringent conditions. In contrast, HPV DNA sequences could not be detected in any of the nine cases of micropapillomatosis. Immunoperoxidase studies performed on these lesions failed to demonstrate viral capsid antigen.

Inner ear cholesteatoma and the preservation of cochlear function. Labyrinthine destruction by direct cholesteatoma invasion has always been considered a serious threat to the inner ear function. A number of reports in the literature have cited both patients who had preservation of hearing despite widespread erosion of the labyrinth by cholesteatoma and patients who had retained auditory function despite surgical removal of the matrix from the labyrinth. In most cases the vestibular portion of the inner ear was invaded but cases of cochlear involvement have been described as well. Twelve cases with pre-operative auditory function preservation despite extensive labyrinthine destruction treated at our Institution are reported. Seven cases retained cochlear function post-operatively. Possible explanations of this occurrence and implications of related with hearing preservation in the presence of widespread inner ear destruction by chronic inflammatory disease are discussed.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A spreadsheet for AIDS: estimating heterosexual injection drug user population size from AIDS statistics in San Francisco. A single-page computer spreadsheet can be used to back-calculate the size of the population at risk from the reported number of AIDS cases and HIV seropositivity levels for that population. However, Cohen (1988:35) has cautioned that ""this method requires some heroic assumptions, and is, therefore, fraught with difficulty."" Slight variations in the definition of AIDS, in the progression rate, and in reported seropositivity rates used as data in the spreadsheet can make enormous differences in the results obtained through back-calculation. Despite the limitations of the method, an estimate of the possible size of the IDU population can be derived from back-calculation, with careful consideration of ethnographic realities taken into account. In San Francisco, the present authors believe that there were approximately 13,000 heterosexual IDUs as of the end of 1989. Further demographic divisions by ethnicity, age, sex, and even neighborhood could be made using the same techniques, if AIDS cases and seropositivity levels could be obtained for each variable. Table II predicts a cumulative 705 AIDS diagnoses among San Francisco heterosexual IDUs by the end of 1993, or nearly six times as many as reported through 1988. This prediction is based on an assumption of 2.5% seroconversion per year (1989-1993) and on modest progression-rate increments of 5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, and 3% in the eleventh through fifteenth years after HIV infection. Thus, it shows the magnitude of the epidemic that San Francisco will shortly face and emphasizes the need to act vigorously to prevent further HIV contagion among IDUs as well as from them to their heterosexual partners (drug using or not).",Virus_Diseases
"Psychological stress and susceptibility to the common cold  BACKGROUND. It is not known whether psychological stress suppresses host resistance to infection. To investigate this issue, we prospectively studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to respiratory viruses. METHODS. After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an increase in the virus-specific antibody titer. RESULTS. The rates of both respiratory infection (P less than 0.005) and clinical colds (P less than 0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status, weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge). Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge viruses. Several potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion-extraversion) failed to alter our findings. CONCLUSIONS. Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness, and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Lymphomatoid papulosis followed by large-cell lymphoma: immunophenotypical and genotypical analysis. The immunophenotype and genotype of atypical cells in skin and lymph node infiltrates were investigated in a patient with lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) complicated by anaplastic large-cell lymphoma of the lymph nodes. The large atypical cells in both skin and lymph nodes displayed an almost identical immunophenotype, i.e. CD30+ and CD25+. Southern blot analysis for T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangement revealed an identical gene configuration in DNA extracted from skin and lymph node. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that clonal populations of T cells arising in cutaneous LyP lesions may undergo malignant transformation, spread into regional lymph nodes, and give rise to secondary malignant lymphomas, such as anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Serum soluble CD8 molecule is a marker of CD8 T-cell activation in HIV-1 disease. To characterize CD8 T-cell activation during HIV-1 infection we measured serum soluble CD8 (sCD8) levels longitudinally in seroconverters and in individuals with established HIV infection who were in different stages of illness. CD8 T-cell activation occurs very early in HIV infection. Serum sCD8 levels were elevated in 91.5% of the first seropositive samples in seroconverters. Furthermore, CD8 T-cell activation persists throughout HIV infection. sCD8 predicted the occurrence of AIDS in HIV-seropositive individuals and so the addition of serum sCD8 levels to CD4 T-cell measurements increased the power in predicting the onset of AIDS. The serum level of sCD8 was particularly relevant to the prediction of subsequent CD4 T-cell fall relatively early in infection, for example, in the 3 years after seroconversion. However, later in HIV infection, for example within 2 years prior to development of AIDS, sCD8 levels were less predictive. sCD8 correlated with levels of beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin, which reflect activation of cell types other than CD8. Thus, serum sCD8 level can be a useful marker of specific CD8 T-cell activation, and is an independent predictor of prognosis in HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases
"The natural history of Peyronie's disease. The natural history of Peyronie's disease was evaluated in 97 men by means of a questionnaire. Disease duration ranged from 3 months to 8 years. Questions addressed pain, bending, ability for intercourse, over-all effect of the disease, psychological effects, treatments received and degree of disease progression. Approximately 40% of the patients found pain, bending, ability for intercourse and over-all effects to be unchanged during the course of the disease. Bending and ability for relations worsened in 40% of the patients during the same interval, while only 6% had worsening of pain. Of the patients 77% reported psychological effects due to Peyronie's disease, which improved in 28%, did not change in 36% and worsened in 36%. Over-all, 13% of the patients believed the disease to be one of gradual resolution, 47% believed there had been little or no change and 40% believed that the disease pattern was one of gradual progression.

To determine the frequency of alkaline phosphatase elevations in patients with AIDS, and to identify diagnoses, medications, and demographic factors associated with such elevations, we conducted a retrospective study of the first 90 consecutive AIDS cases in hospitals affiliated with the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, Colorado. We found elevations of alkaline phosphatase in excess of 1,000 IU/L in 17% of consecutive patients with AIDS. This level of elevation was less frequent in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma but there was otherwise no significant association with diagnoses or medications, or transmission categories for AIDS. The majority of the patients with elevations to this level did not have documented opportunistic infections or biliary tract dilatation previously described in the ""cholangitis"" syndrome in AIDS patients.

"Risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women with glomerulonephritis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women with glomerulonephritis and its possible association with immunosuppressive treatment. DESIGN--Retrospective study of cytological or histological specimens from women presenting with glomerulonephritis and a group of case and age matched controls. SETTING--University department of pathology, Norway. PATIENTS--81 women presenting with glomerulonephritis from 1981 to 1988, from whom gynaecological cytological or histological specimens were available. A group of 162 case and age matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age when glomerulonephritis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed, type and characteristics of kidney lesion, stage of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and presence of human papillomavirus, use of immunosuppressive treatment. RESULTS--Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was more common in women with glomerulonephritis than in their controls (16/81 (20%) v 7/162 (4%), p less than 0.001) and was more advanced in those with glomerulonephritis than in the controls (9/81 (11%) of the study group had grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia compared with 1/162 (1%) of the controls). The increased occurrence of cervical lesions was independent of the use of immunosuppressive treatment, but the individual lesions tended to be more advanced when it was used (four of the seven cervical lesions in women with glomerulonephritis who had received immunosuppressive treatment were carcinoma in situ). Of the nine cervical lesions tested, seven were virus associated.

"Ten-year results of operations for rheumatoid cervical spine disorders. The outcome of operations performed on 38 patients for rheumatoid disorders of the cervical spine were analysed 10 or more years later. The mean age of the patients at the time of operation was 56 years (35 to 77); 32 had seropositive disease. The mean duration of the disease was 17 years (four to 36). Twenty-seven patients had painful anterior atlanto-axial subluxation (AAS), nine had subaxial subluxation alone and two had severe cranial subluxation of the odontoid, one also with subaxial subluxation. One patient died from postoperative staphylococcal septicaemia and another 18 died during the follow-up period. Patients with coincident cardiac or other diseases, and those with cranial subluxation of the odontoid of more than 3 mm had an increased mortality. Neither the patients' age nor the magnitude of AAS correlated with mortality. Of the 37 patients with occipitocervical pain, 30 were relieved and all the six patients with tetraparesis were improved. Of the 24 Gallie fusions only 12 were solidly united; patients with long-term cortisone treatment were more likely to develop pseudarthrosis.

"Treatment of fulminant viral hepatic failure with prostaglandin E. A preliminary report. The effect of prostaglandins (PG) in patients with fulminant and subfulminant viral hepatitis was studied. Seventeen patients presented with FHF secondary to hepatitis A (N = 3), hepatitis B (N = 6) and non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis (N = 8). Fourteen of the 17 patients had stage III or IV hepatic encephalopathy (HE). At presentation, the mean AST was 1844 +/- 1246 units/liter, bilirubin 232 +/- 135 mumol/liter, PT 34 +/- 18 and PTT 73 +/- 26 sec, and coagulation factors V and VII were 8 +/- 4 and 9 +/- 51%, respectively. Twelve of 17 patients responded to PGE1 rapidly, with a decrease in AST from 1540 +/- 833 to 188 +/- 324 units/liter, a decrease in prothrombin time from 27 +/- 7 sec to 12 +/- 1 sec, PTT from 61 +/- 10 sec to 31 +/- 2 sec, and an increase in factor V from 9 +/- 4% to 69 +/- 18% and factor VII from 11 +/- 5% to 71 +/- 20%. Five responders with NANB hepatitis relapsed upon discontinuation of therapy, with recurrence of HE and increases in AST and PT but improvement was observed upon retreatment.

Antibodies for human immunodeficiency virus were detected in 51 (53%) women. Of the 33 women with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection, 23 (70%) had human papillomavirus infection compared with 4 of 18 (22%) asymptomatic women who were human immunodeficiency virus seropositive and 10 of 45 (22%) uninfected women (p less than 0.0001). The rate of squamous intraepithelial lesions was 52% (14 of 27) for women with both viruses detected, 18% (6 of 34) for women with either virus detected, and 9% (3 of 35) for uninfected women. Among symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected women, a strong association between human papillomavirus infection and squamous intraepithelial lesions was demonstrated (odds ratio, 12; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 108). Risk was highest for younger women from ethnic or racial minority groups.

"Influences of dietary restriction on immunity to influenza in aged mice. Our previous studies of the immune response of aged mice inoculated with influenza A virus revealed age-related decreases in antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte function (CTL), T-cell proliferation, IL-2 production, antigen presentation, and antibody production. Because dietary restriction (DR) of rodents has been shown to extend maximum life span, delay the onset of tumors, and improve many immunologic parameters in aged animals, we tested the effect of such a regimen on the immune response to the influenza virus. We report that DR significantly inhibited the age-related decline in antigen presentation and T-cell proliferation. It also reduced the decline in antibody production to the virus.

"Patch and prick test study of 593 healthy subjects. 593 recruits selected by the Military Health Service as being healthy and without a history of present or previous dermatitis, or ocular refraction defects, were patch tested with the GIRDCA (Italian Research Group on Contact and Environmental Dermatitis) standard series. Of these, 336 were also patch tested with substances used in the processing and dyeing of textiles and prick tested with 8 major allergens. 74 (12.5%) reacted to 1 or more substances. The most frequent sensitizers were: thimerosal (28 cases), ammoniated mercury (7 cases), phenol-formaldehyde resin (6 cases), parabens, nickel and Disperse Red 17 (4 cases each). 113 recruits reacted to 1 or more prick test allergens.

"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with monoclonal CD4 antibody M-T151. Clinical results and immunopharmacologic effects in an open study, including repeated administration. Recent experimental and clinical data point to the T helper lymphocyte subset as playing a central role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Thus, a therapeutic strategy aimed specifically at the CD4 T cell subset is warranted. We treated patients with active RA for 7 days with a daily dose of 20 mg of CD4 monoclonal antibody M-T151, administered intravenously over 30 minutes. There were no negative side effects. According to changes in the combined parameters of Ritchie articular index, pain assessment, grip strength, and morning stiffness, 6 patients had a good response. Clinical improvement was greatest approximately 2 weeks after termination of the therapy and lasted from 4 weeks to 6 months. Of the serologic parameters of inflammation, only the C-reactive protein level improved in the patients with a favorable response. Close immunologic monitoring revealed a transient, selective depletion of CD4+ T cells after each infusion. During the entire treatment period, residual circulating CD4+ cells were found to be coated with CD4 antibody, whereas free antibody was detected in the serum only for approximately 8 hours after each infusion. Immediately after infusion, soluble CD4 antigen appeared in the serum. In addition to the cell-bound CD4 antibody, complement components could be detected on the surface of the remaining CD4+ cells. The proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to purified protein derivative was significantly diminished 4 weeks after cessation of antibody treatment. Six patients showed a weak antibody response to mouse immunoglobulin. In 4 of the responders who received a second course of therapy (2 of them as outpatients), a therapeutic effect was noted that was similar to that after the first course. Only 1 patient, who had low titers of serum IgE anti-mouse Ig antibodies, showed a mild anaphylactic reaction at the end of the second course of therapy. Treatment of RA with the monoclonal CD4 antibody M-T151 seems to be a promising alternative, although the optimal dose and the regimen of administration are still to be defined.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"IgG subclasses in the serum and skin in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and neonatal lupus erythematosus. IgG subclasses differ in their biologic and chemical properties, such as complement fixation, protein and cellular binding, and placental transfer. In this study, IgG subclasses of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE) and neonatal lupus (NLE) are examined in the serum and in the skin. IgG subclasses in NLE beginning in utero (NLE-heart disease) are compared to subclasses in NLE beginning after birth (NLE-skin disease). Human skin was grafted onto athymic mice, mice were injected with one of eight anti-Ro/SSA maternal NLE sera (four heart block, four skin disease) or seven anti-Ro/SSA SCLE sera, and grafts were examined for IgG subclasses using monoclonal anti-human IgG subclass reagents in an immunofluorescent technique. Lesional skin was examined from four SCLE patients. IgG1 was the only IgG subclass detected in the grafts and skin lesions. IgG1 was the predominant anti-Ro/SSA IgG subclass detected in SCLE and NLE sera in an ELISA using a synthetic Ro/SSA polypeptide. These studies show that the maternal anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies in NLE-heart disease sera are predominantly IgG1 and are therefore likely to be present in the fetus at the time of gestation, when heart block usually develops. Second, differences in the clinical presentations of NLE (in utero vs. postnatal disease) cannot be attributed to differences in anti-Ro/SSA IgG subclasses. Finally, the subclass bound in the skin in SCLE is IgG1, a subclass capable of mediating tissue injury via complement or cellular effectors.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Patellofemoral pain. An arthroscopic perspective. Patellofemoral pain should be approached as thoroughly as any other musculoskeletal disease. A careful patient history and physical examination are mandatory. These are followed by appropriate imaging studies such as radiographs, bone scans, CT scans, CT arthrograms, and MRI, as each individual case demands. Finally, arthroscopy is employed in its proper sequence. This article has been developed as an attempt to define a classification scheme of anterior knee pain and then to narrow this down to pain localized to the patellofemoral joint. The authors have attempted to isolate further the clinical entities to those that can be diagnosed and treated arthroscopically.

"A phase I study of recombinant human interferon-alpha 2a or human lymphoblastoid interferon-alpha n1 and concomitant zidovudine in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary efficacy of concomitant interferon-alpha and zidovudine therapy in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), 56 patients with biopsy-proven KS and documented human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection were enrolled into a phase I study. Interferon-alpha was given intramuscularly at a dose of 9, 18, or 27 mu once a day and zidovudine was administered as 100 or 200 mg every 4 h for 8 weeks followed by a 48-week maintenance period. The major toxicities were anemia, neutropenia, and hepatotoxicity. Neutropenia was dose limiting with 1,200 mg of zidovudine/day and the lowest dose of interferon-alpha (9 mu/day). Hepatotoxicity was dose limiting with 27 mu of interferon and 600 mg of zidovudine/day. Cumulative dose-related anemia or neutropenia was not seen during long-term follow-up. The maximum tolerated doses for the combination were defined as 18 mu daily for interferon-alpha and 600 mg daily for zidovudine. Variable changes in CD4 lymphocytes occurred during the first 8 weeks of therapy. At higher doses of the combination, sustained increases in median CD4 lymphocyte numbers were noted (p less than 0.001). In HIV antigenemic patients, progressive antigen suppression was seen with increasing doses of the combination (p less than 0.005). The overall antitumor response rate was 47%. Tumor regression was associated with better survival benefits (p less than 0.001) and a pretreatment CD4 cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3 (p = 0.01). In conclusion, intermediate doses of interferon-alpha and lower doses of zidovudine appear to be relatively well tolerated and associated with disease improvement, including survival benefits.",Virus_Diseases

"A clinicopathologic study of the eyes in familial adenomatous polyposis with extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome). The eyes of a 51-year-old woman with familial adenomatous polyposis and extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome) were obtained postmortem and studied by light microscopy and by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We found a generalized abnormality in melanogenesis of the retinal pigment epithelium and at least three types of pigmented lesions. The histologic findings in one type of lesion were consistent with congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium or benign pigmented nevus of the retinal pigment epithelium. The other two types of lesion were most consistent with hamartomatous malformations of the retinal pigment epithelium featuring cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and rarely retinal invasion and formation of a minute mushroom-shaped tumor. These histopathologic findings indicate a generalized effect of the familial adenomatous polyposis gene on the retinal pigment epithelium. This oncogene, which is responsible for tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract, soft tissues, bone, and other locations in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, also leads to a generalized defect in melanogenesis and focal lesions of the retinal pigment epithelium.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Comparison of sequential cyproterone acetate/estrogen versus spironolactone/oral contraceptive in the treatment of hirsutism. The effects of the antiandrogen drugs cyproterone acetate (CPA) and spironolactone on hair growth and androgen levels were compared in a randomized study of 48 hirsute women. Twenty six subjects completed 6 months of therapy with 100 mg/day CPA and 19 subjects completed 6 months of 100 mg/day spironolactone. All except 10 subjects received concomitant estrogen therapy. Measured objectively, total hair diameter fell by 17.1% with spironolactone (P less than 0.001), and by 16.8% with CPA (P less than 0.001). The diameter of the hair medulla fell by 17.8% with spironolactone (P less than 0.01), and by 31.7% with CPA (P less than 0.001). There was no difference between the drugs in their effect on hair diameter. Plasma testosterone levels also fell significantly with both drugs. As a subjective assessment of treatment efficacy, the frequency with which subjects performed cosmetic measures was recorded. This fell by 38% with spironolactone and by 44.7% with CPA (P less than 0.001 both drugs), and again there was no difference between the drugs. Side effects caused cessation of treatment in one subject taking CPA and two subjects taking spironolactone, and milder side effects were noted in two further subjects from each treatment group. We conclude that spironolactone and CPA, in the dosages used in this study, are effective and well tolerated agents for the treatment of hirsutism, and that neither drug demonstrates a particular advantage over the other.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Hepatic involvement in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection: discrepancies between AIDS patients and those with earlier stages of infection. The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on type and severity of liver disease was studied in 61 HIV-positive patients who did not have AIDS and in 45 AIDS patients. Liver biopsies revealed viral hepatitis in 12 of 18 non-AIDS patients but in only 4 of 34 AIDS patients (P less than .0005, Fisher's exact test). Acute, non-A non-B, and chronic active hepatitis B were seen exclusively in the non-AIDS group; however, chronic persistent hepatitis B was seen in both groups. In 9 of 18 AIDS patients intra vitam liver histopathology established diagnoses of opportunistic infections or tumors. Tissue reaction to certain pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus, mycobacteria, and cryptococci, seems to be milder in AIDS patients than in others who are HIV positive or the expected reaction of the normal host. This is likely because of impaired cell-mediated immunity in patients with advanced HIV disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Anorectal surgery in the HIV+ patient: update. Anorectal surgery in HIV+ patients historically has been viewed with a great deal of nihilism. Advances in medical therapy and better understanding of unique pathophysiologic processes have afforded the colorectal surgeon the ability to treat better and sometimes cure the anorectal complications of AIDS. We present a series of 75 consecutive surgical procedures (1-year accrual) on HIV+ (40) and CDC AIDS (22) patients. Surgical procedures, perioperative T cell counts, and outcome will be presented; 53 percent of procedures resulted in complete healing of anal wounds; 30 percent resulted in partial healing with symptomatic relief; 17 percent resulted in symptomatic relief or tissue diagnosis without appreciable wound healing. The healing rate was significantly higher in the HIV+ group (69 percent) compared to the AIDS group (26 percent). Perioperative T cell counts did not have predictive value on outcome. No patients suffered significant unexpected morbidity, mortality, or incontinence.

"Infectious transmission of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type II in rabbits. To determine the susceptibility of rabbits to experimental infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-II (HTLV-II), four separate groups of four weanling rabbits each were inoculated intravenously with lethally irradiated HTLV-II-infected human cell lines Mo-T (HTLV-IIMo-infected T cells), WIL-NRA (an Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell line infected with HTLV-IINRA), 729pH6neo (an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line transfected with a molecular clone of HTLV-IIMo), or G12.1 (HTLV-II-infected T cells from a Panamanian Guaymi Indian). Two additional groups of four rabbits each were similarly inoculated with control uninfected 729 or HuT 78 cells. Early and persistent seroconversion to HTLV-II core antigen p24, as determined by Western immunoblot, occurred in all HTLV-II-inoculated rabbits and was most intense in rabbits inoculated with G12.1 cells; seroreactivity to other HTLV-II gag or env antigens occurred later, with less intensity, or not in all inoculated rabbits. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and other lymphoid cells from HTLV-II-inoculated rabbits produced minimal p24 in vitro, as determined by enzyme immunosorbent capture assay. Virus was more readily detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of HTLV-II pol sequences; this occurred most frequently in rabbits inoculated with Mo-T cells, and most frequently in PBMC as compared with other tissues tested (bone marrow, brain, and liver). No evidence of disease occurred in HTLV-II-inoculated rabbits observed for as long as 24 weeks. All control rabbits remained negative for evidence of HTLV-II infection, as determined by the same procedures. These results provide the first evidence of HTLV-II infection in a species other than humans, and demonstrate the usefulness of the rabbit as an animal model to study the biologic response to different isolates of this human retrovirus.",Virus_Diseases
"Neuropeptides in skin disease: increased VIP in eczema and psoriasis but not axillary hyperhidrosis. The neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P and somatostatin were studied in skin biopsies from patients with eczema, psoriasis and axillary hyperhidrosis. VIP concentrations were elevated in skin affected by eczema and psoriasis, whereas substance P and somatostatin levels did not differ from controls. There was a higher concentration of VIP, but not of substance P or somatostatin, in normal axillary skin when compared to adjacent trunk skin, with abundant VIP-containing fibres surrounding eccrine sweat glands. The VIP concentration was unchanged in skin affected by axillary hyperhidrosis. VIP may increase local blood flow in eczema and psoriasis, but does not appear to play a role in axillary hyperhidrosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Failure of vasoldilator infusion to alter pulmonary diffusing capacity in systemic sclerosis. PURPOSE: Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) do not exhibit a normal increase in the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) on assuming the supine position. We sought to determine whether a potent prostacyclin derivative and vasodilator, iloprost, would reverse this defect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with SSc were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of iloprost. Patients were tested before and during 3 days of iloprost or placebo infusion with both upright and supine pulmonary function studies. RESULTS: The results of baseline pulmonary function studies including DLCO were not significantly altered by iloprost. Furthermore, iloprost did not alter the abnormal postural DLCO response. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the pulmonary vascular defects seen in this group of patients are not a consequence of reversible pulmonary vasospasm.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"In situ DNA hybridization analysis of oral papillomas, leukoplakias, and carcinomas for human papillomavirus. Twenty-one papillomas, 23 ordinary benign keratoses, 13 smokeless tobacco keratoses, 10 verrucous hyperplasias, 10 verrucous carcinomas, 17 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 epithelial dysplasias, and 6 lichen planus lesions were evaluated for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35, with biotinylated double-stranded DNA probes by in situ hybridization. Sixty-two percent (13/21) of oral squamous papillomas were positive for HPV DNA. HPV DNA types 6 and 11 demonstrated the strongest reactivity. Of the 13 cases, 10 also showed some reactivity with HPV-16/18 and -31/33/35. None of the cases of keratoses, epithelial dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous hyperplasia, verrucous carcinoma, or lichen planus were positive for HPV DNA.

"Specific synthetic peptides for detection of and discrimination between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. A panel of highly purified synthetic oligopeptides representing defined parts of the gag and env proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 were used as antigens in ELISA for serodiagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. The analysis included sera from 321 HIV-infected patients and 201 healthy controls from the Ivory Coast, where the prevalence is high for both HIV-1 and HIV-2, and sera from European HIV-1-infected individuals. All sera from HIV-1-infected individuals reacted with a 20 amino acid (a.a.) peptide JB-4c (a.a. 594-613) derived from a highly immunogenic conserved region of the external part of gp41. An equally good response was seen in the HIV-2-infected individuals to a 20 a.a. peptide, JB-16c, from the corresponding part of HIV-2 gp36. Both HIV-1- and HIV-2-seropositive individuals responded well to a peptide, JB-8pc (a.a. 427-448), representing the C-terminal end of the putative CD4-binding site of gp120 of HIV-1. The frequency of reactivity to three selected HIV-1 gag peptides derived from p17 and p15 was 60-70% in both HIV-1 and HIV-2-positive sera. To distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection, the sera were titrated against the peptides. Although there was a high degree of cross-reactivity at lower serum dilutions, it was possible to discriminate the infections at higher dilutions to the HIV-1 and HIV-2 gp41/gp36 peptides JB-4c and JB-16c. Analysis of serum reactivity to several selected peptides thus allowed the identification of HIV infection, and the discrimination between HIV-1 and HIV-2.",Virus_Diseases

Scalp reduction has become an important part of the cosmetic surgeon's armamentarium in the treatment of male pattern alopecia. Recently, the use of two-stage tissue expansion has been advocated for scalp reduction. Intraoperative tissue expansion obviates many of the disadvantages of delayed expansion and increases the yield of excised scalp by 20-30% over standard reduction techniques in the 20 patients studied. The addition of hyaluronidase to the local anesthetic facilitates its diffusion, enhancing anesthesia and the ease of dissection. Therefore, the use of intraoperative tissue expansion and the addition of hyaluronidase to the local anesthetic are two separate adjuncts to scalp reduction surgery.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Acquired perforating dermatosis. Transepidermal elimination of DNA material and possible role of leukocytes in pathogenesis. A patient had acquired perforating dermatosis and suffered from renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and lupus vulgaris. Histologic and immunohistochemical studies revealed that the bulk of the coarse granular basophilic material being extruded by transepidermal elimination was of nuclear origin obviously derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes that were particularly abundant in an early, nonperforated lesion. At the lower boundary of the material being eliminated transepidermally, leukocytes were seen to accumulate, to undergo pyknosis and karyorrhexis, and to transform into nuclear debris. As a minor component, the material contained collagen fibers with altered staining qualities and, in an early lesion, elastic fibers. We speculate that accumulation, disintegration, and enzyme release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes may represent an important, hitherto disregarded driving force in transepidermal elimination. Lysosomal enzymes may later be responsible for the alteration of staining properties in collagen fibers, the degradation of elastic fibers, and for opening up the transepidermal route by impairing intercellular keratinocyte cohesion.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The effectiveness of the hair-restorer ""Dabao"" in males with alopecia androgenetica. A clinical experiment. In a randomized, double-blind trial the effectiveness of 6 months' use of a Chinese herb extract (Dabao) as a hair-restorer was studied on 396 males with alopecia androgenetica. The effect was evaluated by nonvellus hair counts, participants' opinions and a panel's judgement of a photo-report. Twenty-three participants withdrew prematurely from the study. In both the Dabao and placebo groups an increase in the amount of hair was observed; 133 and 109 hairs on a 5 cm2 marked area, a difference of 24 hairs (p = 0.03, one-sided). Participants as well as the panel reached a similar conclusion. Regarding cosmetic effect, 42% of the participants in the Dabao group and 37% in the placebo group reported positive results. The average panel score for the cosmetic result on a scale of -10 to +10 was 0.46 in the Dabao and 0.21 in the placebo group, a difference of 0.24 (p = 0.04, one-sided).

"Herpes simplex virus hepatitis after solid organ transplantation in adults. Twelve patients developed herpes simplex (HSV) hepatitis a median of 18 days after solid organ transplantation. This is earlier than cytomegalovirus hepatitis, which usually occurs 30-40 days after transplantation. Eight recipients (67%) died, and in seven, the diagnosis was made at autopsy or less than 48 h before death. Clinical manifestations associated with mortality were hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), metabolic acidosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bacteremia. Laboratory abnormalities at diagnosis associated with mortality were high creatinine, low platelet counts, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, and a high percentage of band forms on the blood smear. Disseminated HSV disease was noted in four of six patients who had an autopsy and included involvement of lungs in three and the gastrointestinal tract in three. Five recipients developed DIC and all died. Pathologically, HSV hepatitis has two forms, focal and diffuse. All three patients with diffuse liver pathology died. However, three of seven with focal liver pathology survived with antiviral therapy, which suggests that early diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving.

"Hepatitis C virus infection and chronic liver disease in children with leukemia in long-term remission. Antibody to the recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) was investigated in sera of 50 leukemic children who had chronic liver disease (CLD), observed for 1 to 12.6 years after therapy withdrawal. All patients were tested for anti-HCV at regular intervals: Ortho-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was performed in all cases. Reactive sera were also tested by recombinant immunoblotting assay to define the specificity of the results obtained by ELISA. Twelve cases (24%) were persistently positive (group A), 11 (22%) were transiently anti-HCV+ positive (group B), and 27 (54%) were negative. Mean SGPT peak during follow-up was significantly higher in group A (P = .014, A v B and P less than .00001, A v C). SGPT normalized off-therapy in 1 of 12 cases (group A), 10 of 11 (group B), and 19 of 27 (group C) (P = .0004, A v B and P = .012, A v C). Accordingly, liver histology, available in 37 patients, showed signs of chronic hepatitis in all patients in group A while most patients in group B and C had less severe liver lesions. These results indicate that HCV plays a significant role in the etiology of chronic hepatitis in leukemic patients and that persistent anti-HCV activity correlates with a more severe CLD, which could jeopardize the final prognosis of children cured of leukemia.",Virus_Diseases
"Relative efficacy of 335 and 365 nm radiation in photochemotherapy of psoriasis. The action spectrum for the induction of phototoxic erythema by treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and UVA peaks at around 335 nm. Because earlier investigations reported peak phototoxic activity at 365 nm, we compared the antipsoriatic efficacy of 335 and 365 nm in an oral psoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) regimen using a monochromator. PUVA with 335 nm was twice as effective as with 365 nm, with respect to both erythemogenicity and the cumulative dose required for clearing psoriasis. However, 335 and 365 nm were equally effective if delivered in equal erythema doses.

An acute infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVSM) in cynomolgus monkeys was used to evaluate the antiviral effects of 3'-fluorothymidine (FLT) and 3'-azidothymidine [zidovudine (ZDV)]. Neither compound prevented the infection despite dosing prior to virus inoculation. FLT was about ten times more potent than ZDV in delaying the appearance of SIVSM antigen in the monkeys. The serum half-life of FLT was longer than that of ZDV and ZDV was bound to plasma proteins to about 60% while FLT was virtually unbound. It is proposed that the in vivo difference in potency between ZDV and FLT could, at least partly, be explained as the combined effects of a longer plasma half-life and a higher free concentration of FLT and possibly a higher intracellular concentration of the triphosphate of FLT.",Virus_Diseases

"Antiinflammatory and antiarthritic properties of a substituted quinoline carboxylic acid: CL 306,293. CL 306,293, a substituted quinoline carboxylic acid at a daily oral dose between 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg suppressed the inflammation and joint destruction (radiological criteria) associated with both developing and established adjuvant arthritis. When a weekly oral dosing regimen was used, joint destruction was attenuated when this agent was administered at a dose of 50 to 200 mg/kg. Inflammation associated with a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in dogs was suppressed at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg or a weekly dose of 1 mg/kg. At efficacious doses, CL 306,293 had no effects on cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase activities nor did it have an effect on carrageenin induced paw edema. In acute tests, the compound was not ulcerogenic. The above observations indicate that the antiinflammatory effects of CL 306,293 are distinct from those observed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Mechanistic studies conducted and to be published indicate that CL 306,293 down regulates T cell function and this mechanism may account, at least in part, for the antiinflammatory and antiarthritic properties observed in animal models of inflammation and joint destruction.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Antibodies to synthetic peptides from Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 in sera of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis and in preillness sera. We studied IgG antibody levels to synthetic peptides (p62, E11 and E3) from Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) protein sequence in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in pre-RA and in rheumatoid factor (RF) positive non-RA sera from Finland. Anti-E11 and anti-E3 antibody levels were significantly elevated in RA sera, compared with both RF negative and RF positive nonrheumatoid controls. The concentrations of anti-E11 and anti-E3 antibodies in the preillness sera were lower than those in RA sera. Eight-year followup samples of patients with RA had slightly decreased levels of anti-E3 and anti-E11 antibodies compared with samples taken within 6 months of the disease onset. Anti-p62 antibody levels did not differ significantly between any of the groups studied. Thus, elevated levels of antibodies to 2 of the glycine containing EBNA-1 peptides were associated with clinical RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Erythema infectiosum and pregnancy-related complications  Erythema infectiosum, an acute, communicable viral disease with a highly distinctive exanthem, follows the usual course of a self-limiting benign disease. In pregnant women, however, it may be associated with fetal death and nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Because of the association of human parvovirus (HPV) B19 infection with fetal damage we reviewed the current knowledge of the clinical aspects of erythema infectiosum, focusing on pregnancy and fetal outcome, to determine the magnitude of fetal risk and offer recommendations for management. Among 180 infected pregnant women 44 fetal deaths (24%) occurred, 1 to 12 weeks after the infection was noted. Pregnant women should be advised that (a) because of the high prevalence (up to 65%) of anti-HPV B19 IgG antibody among adults most of them are not at risk and (b) if maternal infection does occur therapeutic abortion is not indicated since intrauterine infection causes fetal death more often than abnormal development. Infection should be suspected in pregnant women who exhibit the symptoms of erythema infectiosum with or without arthropathy. They should be monitored for an elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level (indicating fetal aplastic crisis) and undergo serial ultrasonography for the detection of hydrops fetalis. Although the incidence of congenital malformation is no higher than the expected rate in the general population (3% to 5%), the precise incidence of fetal adverse outcomes remains unknown and requires investigation in larger, prospective studies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Toxicity profiles of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis. The toxicity profiles of 7 disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) (hydroxychloroquine, intramuscular (im) gold, D-penicillamine, oral gold, methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine and cyclophosphamide) were evaluated in 2,479 patients with rheumatoid arthritis consecutively enrolled at 5 centers in the Arthritis, Rheumatism and Aging Medical Information System (ARAMIS) program. Incidence rates for side effects are reported as events/1000 patient-years. Our descriptive study revealed an individual profile of prevalent toxicities for each drug. Oral gold was characterized by substantial lower gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (diarrhea 391 events/1000 patient-years, loose bowel movement 148, lower abdominal pain 76), MTX by hepatotoxicity (47) while D-penicillamine had the only clinically significant incidence of altered taste (40). MTX users reported the most mucosal ulcers (87), followed by oral gold (76), im gold (55) and D-penicillamine (38). Rash was frequently seen with gold compounds and D-penicillamine, while upper GI toxicity was common with immunosuppressive agents. Cyclophosphamide had 48% discontinuations within 6 months. MTX had the lowest discontinuation rate in the first 6 months, but then showed little difference from im gold. A preliminary similarity index was developed to compare the toxicity profiles of various DMARD. Close similarities were found between toxicity profiles of im gold and D-penicillamine, and between azathioprine and MTX. Oral gold had a unique toxicity pattern. Knowledge of these different toxicity patterns can enable more appropriate selection of agents for particular patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Young adults with special health care needs: prevalence, severity, and access to health services. Health care needs of disabled young adults and access to care are analyzed using the 1984 National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative sample of 10,394 randomly selected noninstitutionalized young adults aged 19 to 24. In 1984, 1.4 million young adults (almost 6%) suffered from disabilities. The leading cause of disability was diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue. Young adults living in poverty, in households where the family reference person had less than a high school education, and who were male were at elevated risk of disability. Disabled young adults made almost three times as many physician contacts and were hospitalized for close to six times as many days as nondisabled young adults. One of every 5 disabled young adults was uninsured in 1984. Forty-one percent of disabled Hispanic 19- to 24-year-olds and 51% of disabled young adults of other races were uninsured compared with 19% of whites and blacks.

"Human immunodeficiency virus-associated eosinophilic folliculitis. A unique dermatosis associated with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. We studied 13 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and a chronic pruritic folliculitis that was unresponsive to systemic treatment with bactericidal anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. The skin eruption was characterized by multiple urticarial follicular papules scattered on the trunk (100%), the head and neck (85%), and the proximal aspect of the extremities (62%). Absolute peripheral eosinophil counts were increased in six of 13 patients; a relative peripheral eosinophilia was present in 10 of 13 patients. Serum IgE levels were elevated in all seven patients tested (range, 88 to 9050 IU). Histopathologic features included a folliculitis with eosinophils. Pathogenic bacteria were not consistently found by routine bacterial skin cultures, cultures of skin biopsy specimens, or histopathologic evaluation. CD4 counts were decreased in all of the 12 patients tested (less than 300 cells per cubic millimeter) and were below 250 cells per cubic millimeter in 10 patients. A clinical response was noted to astemizole, to ultraviolet light in the B range, and to topical clobetasol propionate. These observations demonstrate that HIV-associated eosinophilic folliculitis is a unique HIV-related cutaneous disorder that is characterized by a culture-negative, chronic, pruritic folliculitis and a characteristic histopathologic picture. Of special importance, because it is associated with CD4 counts of less than 250 to 300 cells per cubic millimeter, eosinophilic folliculitis appears to be an important clinical marker of HIV infection and, particularly, of patients at increased risk of developing opportunistic infections. We suggest that the term eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (Ofuji's disease), previously used to describe this dermatosis in HIV-infected patients, should be discarded.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Measles antibody concentrations in Gambian children immunised at 4 months of age with a high-dose Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) measles vaccine or at 9 months with conventional Schwarz vaccine were measured 5 months after vaccination, and at 18 and 36 months of age. Schwarz vaccinees produced, on average, a 2.4-fold higher concentration of measles haemagglutinin inhibiting (HAI) antibody than EZ vaccinees, but at 36 months of age 82 of 93 (88%) EZ vaccinees and 83 of 87 (95%) Schwarz vaccinees had measles plaque-neutralising antibody concentrations above the assumed protective level of 200 mIU/ml (p greater than 0.1). HAI antibody concentrations 5 months after vaccination were inversely related to the presence of maternal antibody at vaccination, but above protective levels; at 18 and 36 months of age there was no relation to antibody concentration at vaccination, and decay of HAI antibody between 18 and 36 months of age was similar for EZ and Schwarz vaccinees.",Virus_Diseases

It was not found in normal subjects in the absence of previous chest injury. The presence and extent of costochondral enlargement was unrelated to the duration of active or cured acromegaly, the initial or present growth hormone concentrations, or other clinical features of growth hormone excess.

"Astrovirus and adenovirus associated with diarrhea in children in day care settings. The relative importance of astrovirus and adenoviruses as etiologic agents of diarrhea among children in day care was examined. Stool specimens from this prospective study were screened for both astrovirus and adenovirus hexon with two new indirect double-antibody assays and for enteric adenoviruses with an EIA specific for serotypes 40 and 41. Astrovirus was detected in a significantly greater percentage of children with diarrhea (4%, 21/524) than of those without (less than 1%, 1/138) (P less than .05); however, no difference between such such children with adenovirus infections was found (8%, 43/565, and 8%, 10/129, respectively). Overall, 30% (13/43) of all adenovirus hexon-positive specimens were enteric serotypes, and by extrapolation, enteric adenoviruses were identified in an equal percentage of children (2%) with and without diarrhea. This study documents the presence of astrovirus and enteric adenoviruses among children in day care in the United States, associates astrovirus with diarrhea in this setting, and suggests that viral agents may be the most common enteric pathogens among children with diarrhea in day care.",Virus_Diseases
"Diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia by ultrastructural examination of exfoliative cytologic specimens. Lingual exfoliative cytologic specimens (scrapings) were obtained from 18 patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus with clinical oral hairy leukoplakia. Buccal mucosal scrapings were obtained from 12 of these patients. The specimens were processed for examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Sixteen (89%) of the lingual specimens revealed infection of keratinocytes by herpes-type virus. There was no evidence of virus infection in the 12 buccal mucosal scrapings. Fungal hyphae were seen by TEM in 14 (78%) of the lingual scrapings and two (17%) of the buccal scrapings. One exfoliative specimen and two biopsy specimens were stained for Epstein-Barr virus DNA with a DNA probe.

"Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy (AHEI)--a variant of Henoch-Schonlein purpura or a distinct clinical entity? Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy (AHEI) is an acute cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) of infants. The clinical picture has a violent onset with a short benign course followed by spontaneous complete recovery. We report 12 infants with AHEI who were studied clinically, serologically, and immunohistologically. Edema and palpable purpuric skin lesions were present in all infants who were in good general condition. Serologic studies were unremarkable. Light microscopic examination of the skin biopsy specimens revealed LCV as in Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). Direct immunofluorescent study revealed depositions of various immunoreactants, including fibrinogen, C3, IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE (100%, 100%, 22%, 78%, 33%, and 33%, respectively) in the wall and around the small vessels. Similar deposition of Clq was also present in three infants in whom Clq could be studied (100%). The clinical similarities and differences between AHEI and HSP have been discussed in the literature. AHEI is observed before 2 years of age and is confined to the skin. The skin lesions of HSP are more polymorphic. Although histopathologic findings are similar, the immunohistologic pattern found in our series of AHEI is rather different from the pattern of HSP. Taking all of these findings into account, we suggest that AHEI should be considered as a separate, clinicopathologic entity or a possible variant of HSP.

"Recurrent herpetic keratitis: failure to detect herpes simplex virus infection using the Syva MicroTrak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test. A 35-year-old man had developed recurrent herpetic keratitis characterized by dendritic keratitis at intervals of a year. We were able to culture cytopathic agents repeatedly from his lesions by inoculating Vero cells. The cultures yielded definitive evidence of a virus that caused a cytopathic effect within 3 days. However, these virus strains could not be identified as herpes simplex virus (HSV) in immunofluorescence assays using the Syva MicroTrak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test. Rather they were identified as strains of HSV type 1 (HSV-1) on the basis of plaque morphology, neutralization tests, electron-microscopic examination and DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Our results allow us to assume the existence of HSV-1 strains isolated clinically that are negative to analysis using the Syva Micro-Trak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test.",Virus_Diseases

"Human immunodeficiency virus infection does not alter serum transaminases and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in homosexual patients with chronic HBV infection. The influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the clinical course of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is controversial. We followed a cohort of 64 homosexual men with persistent HBs antigenemia for a median of 24 months in the hepatitis clinic of a large urban public hospital. We divided the patients into three groups according to their immune status. Group 1 (n = 13) consisted of HIV-seropositive men with evidence of immunosuppression; group 2 (n = 17), HIV-positive patients without evidence of immunosuppression; and group 3 (n = 34), HIV-negative patients. We followed serum ALT and HBV DNA determinations. There was no difference in the demographic characteristics of the three groups. Group 1 had significantly lower levels of circulating T4 lymphocytes. We found no differences in the number and severity of episodes of HBV reactivation, serum ALT levels, or HBV DNA scores among the three groups. In each group, the percentage of patients with circulating HBV DNA was the same. We conclude that HIV infection apparently does not influence the markers of liver inflammation or HBV replication in homosexual men.",Virus_Diseases
"Transmission of hepatitis C virus by organ transplantation  BACKGROUND. Liver disease is a frequent and major complication after organ transplantation. We sought to determine whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted by organ transplantation and whether it causes post-transplantation liver disease. METHODS. Serum samples from all cadaver organ donors to the New England Organ Bank between 1986 and 1990 were screened retrospectively for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We reviewed the hospital records of all recipients of organs from anti-HCV-positive donors for evidence of liver disease. Serum samples from recipients obtained before transplantation and during follow-up were analyzed for anti-HCV. RESULTS. Of 716 organ donors, 13 (1.8 percent) were positive for anti-HCV. Their organs (19 kidneys, 6 hearts, and 4 livers) went to 29 recipients. Non-A, non-B hepatitis developed after transplantation in 14 of the 29 (48 percent), for a prevalence 7.4 times the 6.5 percent prevalence after transplantation from untested donors that was previously reported by two institutions in the organ bank (P less than 0.0001). The liver disease began a mean of 3.8 months after transplantation and became chronic in 12 patients; the other 2 had subfulminant hepatic failure. Liver disease was more frequent in the patients who had received antilymphocyte preparations (P = 0.04). HCV was the cause of the post-transplantation liver disease in 12 of the 13 recipients (92 percent) for whom serum samples were available. Anti-HCV was detected by ELISA in eight and enzyme immunoassay in one; in three others, HCV RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in serum samples obtained after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS. Organ transplantation can transmit hepatitis C. This raises serious questions about the continued acceptance of organs from donors positive for anti-HCV.",Virus_Diseases
"Transient intraepidermal bullous reaction after skin graft for toxic epidermal necrolysis. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features similar to those of inherited epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Blister formation in skin graft donor or recipient sites is uncommon. We describe a 49-year-old female patient with bullae in sites of grafts used in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis. Generalized loss of skin developed 3 weeks after she had ingested phenobarbital. Sixty days after the beginning of the toxic epidermal necrolysis, the reepidermization was only 80% and skin grafts were placed on lower-extremity and abdominal wounds using the first healed sites as donor sites. Several bullae and erosions were noted on grafted areas 3 weeks later. Skin biopsy specimens revealed separation at the dermoepidermal junction, and no autoantibodies were detected by direct and indirect immunofluorescence. Electron microscopy demonstrated that the blister was formed through the basal keratinocytes and that the dermoepidermal junction, including hemidesmosomes and anchoring fibrils, was normal. Immunofluorescence mapping was performed using polyclonal antibodies from the serum of patients with bullous pemphigold and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and monoclonal antibodies against GB3 antigen and collagen type VII. All but the bullous pemphigold serum gave positive results; only faint and focal staining of the dermoepidermal junction was observed with bullous pemphigold serum. These findings are the same as those encountered in hereditary epidermolysis bullosa simplex. A biopsy performed 1 year later in the same site as the first one revealed that bullous pemphigold antigen was normally expressed.

"Slit grafting: the use of serrated island grafts in male and female-pattern alopecia. Successful aesthetic treatment of earlier thinning of scalp hair in men and women has necessitated the development of alternatives to traditional punch grafting. The hair-bearing ""serrated island"" remaining between two parallel rows of round donor sites can be removed and dissected to yield a large number of ""serrated island grafts"" and single-hair grafts. These miniature grafts, along with half grafts from bisected plugs, can be placed, in one or several sessions, into dozens to hundreds of small ""slits"" between the remaining hairs in patients with early or advanced thinning on the crown, vertex, or anterior scalp--hence the name ""slit grafting."" The versatility of this technique is demonstrated by its value for patients with dark hair and light skin, in repair work, in patients necessitating extensive vertex coverage, or in combination with alopecia reduction and traditional punch grafting. The finely tufted progressive growth from hundreds of these carefully placed slit grafts can thus counteract further hair loss in a variety of different situations.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"HLA-D locus associations in alopecia areata. DRw52a may confer disease resistance. Because predisposition to autoimmunity has been associated with HLA-D alleles and alopecia areata is hypothesized to be a T-cell mediated autoimmune hair loss, we determined DR and DQ alleles in 88 white and 10 American black patients with alopecia areata as well as controls with the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism typing with cDNA probes. White patients with alopecia areata have an increase in the phenotype frequencies of DR4 and DQw8 and an increase in genotype frequencies of DR4 and DR5 (now DRw11[5]). These associations are in agreement with those reported in two other studies but are not significant when corrected by the number of HLA antigens tested. Sixty-one percent of all patients with AA have DR4 and/or DRw11(5) specificities vs 40% of controls, with more DR4,DRw11(5) and DQw7(w3), DQw8(w3) heterozygotes among patients. DQw6(w1) phenotype frequencies and DRw52a phenotype and genotype frequencies are significantly decreased in patients with alopecia areata relative to controls. This highly significant negative association with the HLA DRB3 allele DRw52a in whites persisted even when DR4- or DRw11(5)-positive individuals were excluded from the patient and control groups. These data suggest that HLA-DR4 and DRw11(5) with their associated DQw7(w3) and DQw8(w3) specificities may confer susceptibility to alopecia areata, while DRw52a may confer resistance.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

To study the subclass distribution of autoantibodies and their complement-fixing capacity in cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) we studied the sera from 23 patients by both indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on 4-microns cryostat sections of normal human skin and immunoblotting of epidermal or dermal extracts. Monoclonal antibodies of strict specificity for human IgG subclasses were used. Sera from 20 patients with BP served as controls. In addition, total IgG subclass levels were determined by indirect competitive ELISA in all sera. Complement binding capacity was studied by IIF using antibodies to C3 after incubation of skin section with autoantibodies and source of fresh complement. CP autoantibodies reacting with the 230-240 kD and/or the 180-kD epidermal bands showed an IgG4/IgG1 subclass restriction, with a predominance of IgG4 in 10 cases, of IgG1 in four. In BP sera, IgG4 and IgG1 autoantibodies were detected with a similar frequency (100% and 83%, respectively). In EBA sera, autoantibodies reacting with the 290 kD and 145 kD dermal bands also showed an IgG1/IgG4 restriction. Concordant results were obtained by IIF. However, the IIF method had a lower sensitivity for the detection of IgG4 CP antibodies and IgG1 EBA antibodies than immunoblotting. Finally, when CP antibodies were analyzed for their complement-binding activity, it was found that sera containing IgG4 autoantibodies alone never fixed complement whereas all complement-fixing CP sera had IgG1 autoantibodies, suggesting that only this subclass of antibodies is capable of fixing complement.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

MAIN RESULTS--Significantly more homosexual subjects than heterosexual subjects were positive for hepatitis C antibody determined by enzyme immunoassay alone (19/275 (6.9%) v 8/771 (1.0%), odds ratio 7.14, p less than 0.0001) and also when reactive serum samples were also tested by recombinant immunoblot assay (6/270) (2.2%) v 3/770 (0.4%), odds ratio 5.88, p less than 0.02). There were also significant associations in patients positive for hepatitis C antibody with positivity for antibodies to HIV and to hepatitis B core antigen, lifetime number of sexually transmitted diseases (homosexual men only), and age (all groups combined). Most patients whose serum samples contained specific antibodies to hepatitis C virus were viraemic. CONCLUSIONS--The study provides strong evidence for the sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus. Assays derived from other gene products are desirable to investigate the specificity and sensitivity of the enzyme immunoassay for C100 antibody as a marker of hepatitis C virus infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Ataxia in myxoedema: a neurophysiological reassessment. In a long-standing case of myxoedema with ataxia and dysarthria, neurophysiological investigations were carried out to assess how much of the ataxic dysbasic syndrome depended on the slowness of mechanical contraction and how much resulted from primary cerebellar involvement. It was observed that the Achilles reflexogram showed a marked prolongation of contraction and relaxation time and that in both quadriceps and triceps surae mechanical percussion induced a marked myxoedema and prolonged relaxation time. The EMG of these muscles during voluntary contraction and stopping reaction detected an excessive recruitment of the antagonistic muscles, starting without any abnormal delay, a finding at variance with a typical cerebellar pattern. Post-urographic analysis gave a pattern of oscillations still within the normal range. These findings suggest that the gait alterations of our patient depended on the increase in muscle contraction time and the consequent excessive recruitment of the antagonists.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Ditiocarb sodium (diethyldithiocarbamate) therapy in patients with symptomatic HIV infection and AIDS. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. We randomized 389 symptomatic patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to ditiocarb sodium (400 mg/m2 orally for 24 weeks) or a placebo. Patients were well balanced according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) group, CD4+ cell number, and duration of disease prior to entry. Ten new acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infections occurred in the treated patients and 21 in the controls. Reduction of new opportunistic infections in the ditiocarb group was significant in all patients (relative risk [RR], 0.44) and in patients with AIDS (CDC groups IV-C1 and IV-D) (RR, 0.12). The size of the effect of ditiocarb was maintained when data were reanalyzed after exclusion of a patient who progressed to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who was not strictly CDC-defined (RR, 0.46), or when considering as new opportunistic infections three events, which were clinically active at entry, but for which the definitive diagnosis was made during study (RR, 0.49). The administration of ditiocarb did not induce any major adverse clinical or biological reactions. We conclude that, in this study, ditiocarb was safe and reduced the incidence of opportunistic infections in patients with symptomatic HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Pharmacologic modulation of picryl chloride-induced contact dermatitis in the mouse. A biphasic response of ear swelling was observed 2 h and 24 h after application of the antigen to picryl chloride-sensitized Balb/c mice. A platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, BN 52063, or the anti-inflammatory drug, betamethasone, applied topically or injected subcutaneously, inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the antigen-induced increase in ear thickness observed after 24 h. In addition, BN 52063 and betamethasone presented a synergistic effect when administered in vivo simultaneously and subcutaneously. Indomethacin administered subcutaneously at the time of the antigen challenge significantly potentiated the early swelling phase and inhibited the late one. In contrast, the inhibitors of histamine and serotonin, ketotifen and methysergide, respectively, modulated mostly the early, and to a lower extent the late phase when administered at the time of antigen challenge. In contrast, none of these drugs inhibited the late phase reaction when administered 4 h after the antigen. A significant eosinophil and mononuclear-cell ear infiltrate was observed following topical application of the antigen, a phenomenon that was markedly reduced by either BN 52063 or betamethasone. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAF antagonists, either alone or in association with glucocorticosteroids, in experimental CD, the modulation of the infiltration of eosinophils and mononuclear cells possibly explaining part of the inhibitory action of these drugs.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Preventing secondary infections among HIV-positive persons. Secondary infectious diseases contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The authors developed comprehensive, practical recommendations for prevention of infectious complications in HIV-infected people. Recommendations are concerned with the pathogens that are more common or more severe in HIV-infected people. Several infectious complications can be prevented by avoiding ingestion of contaminated food or water. Zoonoses can be prevented by precautions to be taken in contacts with animals. The risk of several fungal diseases can be reduced if activities likely to lead to inhalation of spores are avoided. HIV-infected people should be advised how to lower adverse health effects of travel, especially international travel. The potential for infectious complications of sexual activity and illicit drug use should be stressed, and recommendations to reduce the risk are discussed. Recommendations for use of vaccines in HIV-infected people are reviewed. Blood CD4+ lymphocyte concentrations, tuberculin skin testing, Toxoplasma serology, and sexually transmitted disease screening should be performed in certain subsets of HIV-infected people. Guidelines for chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii and tuberculosis are presented. Recent data suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may prevent bacterial infections in HIV-infected children.",Virus_Diseases
"Neurocutaneous melanosis: definition and review of the literature. Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by the presence of large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and benign or malignant pigment cell tumors of the leptomeninges. The syndrome is thought to represent an error in the morphogenesis of the embryonal neuroectoderm. We review 39 reported cases of neurocutaneous melanosis and propose revised criteria for diagnosis. Most patients with neurocutaneous melanosis presented in the first 2 years of life with neurologic manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, or spinal cord compression. Leptomeningeal melanoma was present in 62% of the cases, but even in the absence of melanoma, symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis had an extremely poor prognosis. Useful diagnostic procedures include cerebrospinal fluid cytology and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast. Patients may be aided by palliative measures such as shunt placement to reduce intracranial pressure. Dermatologists in their follow-up of patients with large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi should be aware of this condition, to aid in prompt diagnosis and because the treatment of cutaneous lesions may be altered in the presence of symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Recurrent wheezy bronchitis and viral respiratory infections  Fifty four patients aged from 1 to 6 years who had had recurrent attacks of wheezy bronchitis were prospectively followed up for three months to find out if there was an association between different viral respiratory infections and episodes of wheezing. Of the 115 episodes of upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection were diagnosed in 52 (45%). Thirty four of rhinoviruses. The patients had an average of 2.1 episodes of respiratory tract symptoms the total mean (SD) duration of which was 30 (2) days of the 92 days that followed. Wheezing occurred during 76 (66%) of the 115 episodes and during a third of these the patient was admitted to hospital because of severe dyspnoea. Wheezing started a mean (SD) of 43 (7) hours after the first symptoms of respiratory infection and persisted for 3.8 (4.2) days in patients in whom virus infection was diagnosed. The incidence of wheezing was not associated with IgE mediated atopy, with positive virological tests, or with fever during virus infection, but was associated with parental smoking and more than one sibling.",Virus_Diseases
"The safety and immunogenicity of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombinant gp160 candidate vaccine in humans. NIAID AIDS Vaccine Clinical Trials Network. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombinant envelope glycoprotein (rgp 160) candidate vaccine in humans. SUBJECTS: Healthy adults (72) who were seronegative for HIV-1 were randomly assigned to one of four groups. INTERVENTIONS: The subjects were randomly assigned to receive 40 or 80 micrograms of rgp 160, 10 micrograms of hepatitis B vaccine, or placebo in three doses (on days 0, 30, and 180), with an elective, nonblinded administration of a fourth dose on day 540. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Neither clinical nor laboratory toxicity was encountered during a follow-up period exceeding 21 months. No effect of immunization was noted on lymphocyte counts, mitogenic responses, or delayed-type hypersensitivity. Serum antibody responses to HIV envelope proteins detected by Western blot were seen in 30 of 33 subjects (91%; 95% CI, 71% to 97%) receiving either 40- or 80-micrograms doses of rgp160 and were most commonly of weakly reactive intensity. Responses were first noted by Western blot after the second dose. They markedly increased in frequency after the third dose and declined over the next 12 to 18 months. The administration of a fourth dose resulted in homologous neutralizing activity in sera from 5 to 24 subjects (21%; CI, 7% to 37%) as well as in complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement in sera from 6 of 24 subjects (25%; CI, 10% to 42%). Antibody responses were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) less frequently than by Western blot, and these responses persisted for a shorter time. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of rgp160 was well tolerated and safe, resulted in a high rate of antibody response by Western blot after the administration of the third and fourth doses, and generated serum neutralizing activity and complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement in some subjects after the fourth dose.",Virus_Diseases

"Measurement of cutaneous inflammatory reactions using a scanning laser-Doppler velocimeter. The performance of a new scanning laser-Doppler velocimeter (LDV), which can rapidly measure blood flux over a large area of skin without contact with the skin surface, was compared with that of a conventional laser-Doppler instrument. The vascular response was measured to a range of doses of UVB, and dilutions of contact allergens and sodium lauryl sulphate. The detection threshold of the scanning LDV was equal to, or lower than, that of the conventional instrument. For allergic contact hypersensitivity reactions (ACH), the coefficient of variation was significantly less using the scanning LDV. The scanning LDV allowed accurate measurement of the change in area that occurs with increasing intensity of inflammatory reaction. For ACH reactions the area of inflammation continued to increase at dilutions where blood flux had reached a plateau. The flare area was found to increase linearly with log dose of histamine with no change in blood flux.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Clinical role of respiratory virus infection in acute otitis media. The clinical characteristics of acute otitis media in relation to coexisting respiratory virus infection were studied in a 1-year prospective study of 363 children with acute otitis media. Respiratory viruses were detected using virus isolation and virus antigen detection in nasopharyngeal specimens of 42% of the patients at the time of diagnosis. Rhinovirus (24%) and respiratory syncytial virus (13%) were the two most common viruses detected. Adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43 were found less frequently. The mean duration of preceding symptoms was 5.9 days before the diagnosis of acute otitis media. Ninety-four percent of the children had symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Fever was reported in 55% and earache in 47% of cases. Patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection had fever, cough, and vomiting significantly more often than patients with rhinovirus infection or virus-negative patients. No significant differences were found in the appearance of the tympanic membrane and outcome of illness between virus-negative and virus-positive patients with acute otitis. Most patients respond well to antimicrobial therapy despite the coexisting viral infection. If the symptoms of infection persist, they can be due to the underlying viral infection, and viral diagnostics preferably with rapid methods may be clinically useful in these patients.",Virus_Diseases

"Basophil histamine release and airway response to mite allergen in atopic dermatitis. Twelve patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) were subjected to in vitro histamine release from peripheral blood leukocytes (basophils) and in vivo bronchial inhalation challenge using house dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) allergen. Not only seven patients with asthmatic history but also five patients without asthma responded to both the in vitro and the in vivo challenges. A significant correlation was observed between HR30 (a mite concentration producing a 30% release of total cellular histamine) and PC20 allergen (a mite concentration producing a 20% fall in FEV1). There was also a significant correlation between MHR (maximal histamine release) and the maximal fall in FEV1. The relationship held for both AD patients with asthma and without asthma. These results suggest that histamine release induced by the house dust mite allergen is a good in vitro test for predicting the bronchial response to this allergen. They also suggest that these tests are not disease specific, but are valuable in evaluating the degree of atopic state in a subject.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"T-lymphocyte-activating properties of epidermal antigen-presenting cells from normal and psoriatic skin: evidence that psoriatic epidermal antigen-presenting cells resemble cultured normal Langerhans cells. Fresh and cultured human Langerhans cells display disparate functional programs, based on their capacities to activate autologous and allogeneic T cells, and with respect to their susceptibility to inhibition by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta). We have compared the functional properties of epidermal antigen-presenting cells (APC) procured from uninvolved and involved skin of patients with psoriasis with fresh and cultured normal epidermal cells. Freshly obtained psoriatic epidermal APC resembled cultured normal epidermal cells in their superior capacity to activate syngeneic and allogeneic T cells; fresh normal epidermal cells failed to activate syngeneic T cells, and induced only modest proliferation among allogeneic T cells. The modest T-cell--activating properties of fresh, normal epidermal cells were not suppressed by TGF beta, whereas the T-cell--activating potential of psoriatic epidermal cells, cultured normal epidermal cells, and blood APC was inhibited approximately 50% by TGF beta. Thus, fresh psoriatic epidermal APC resemble cultured normal epidermal cells functionally. Because these properties are already evident in cells obtained from uninvolved psoriatic skin, the ""cultured"" functional phenotype of epidermal APC in this disease may precede the appearance of active psoriatic skin lesions. Surface marker analysis of normal and psoriatic epidermal cell suspensions revealed that virtually all of the bone marrow--derived cells in normal epidermal cell suspensions were conventional (CD1+) Langerhans cells, whereas CD1+ cells comprised only a minority of bone marrow--derived (CD45+) cells in psoriatic epidermis. It is speculated that some of the CD1-, CD45+ cells in psoriatic epidermis may be Langerhans cells that have lost their ""fresh"" phenotype. These data indicate that an abnormality in epidermal APC function exists in psoriatic skin--even before clinical lesions develop, and we speculate that the abnormal capacity of psoriatic epidermal APC to activate syngeneic T cells may be important in the expression of keratinocyte pathology. Because psoriatic epidermal APC functions were profoundly inhibited in vitro by treatment with cyclosporin A, the effectiveness of this drug in psoriasis may be due in part to its ability to inhibit epidermal antigen-presenting cell function in vivo.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Antibodies to IL-3 and IL-4 suppress helminth-induced intestinal mastocytosis. Rodents infected with the nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) develop intestinal mastocytosis, eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE levels. Although IL-4 and IL-5 are necessary for stimulation of IgE synthesis and eosinophilia, respectively, the cytokines that regulate gut mast cell hyperplasia have not been identified. To address this question, 6- to 8-wk-old BALB/c mice were injected on day 0 and day 7 of Nb infection with a rat anti-mouse IL-4 mAb, and with polyclonal sheep (day 0) and rabbit (day 7) anti-mouse IL-3 IgG antibodies. Additional Nb-infected mice received equal doses of isotype- and species-matched control antibodies. Mice were sacrificed on days 12 or 13 post-infection, and mucosal mast cells (MMC) in sections of the small intestine were enumerated. Nb infection induced a 25- to 40-fold increase in MMC over that observed in uninfected controls. Anti-IL-3 or anti-IL-4 alone suppressed the Nb-induced MMC response by 40 to 50%, whereas both antibodies combined suppressed the MMC response by 85 to 90%. Anti-IL-3 alone had no effect on the serum IgE levels, which were essentially abrogated in the Nb-infected mice treated with anti-IL-4. Blood eosinophilia was not affected by treatment with anti-IL-3 and/or anti-IL-4. These studies demonstrate that IL-3 and IL-4 are physiologically important stimuli of mastocytosis in vivo, and suggest therapeutic interventions that may counteract adverse host responses to allergens as well as to parasites.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"The familial occurrence of bullous mastocytosis (diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis). We studied four patients (a mother, her two daughters, and her son) with bullous mastocytosis, or diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, whose genetic inheritance suggested an autosomal dominant pattern. The clinical characteristics included extensive bullae, numerous urticaria, pruritus, flushing, and pseudolichenified skin over all body surfaces without systemic organ involvement. The histopathologic findings disclosed a pronounced accumulation of mast cells in the dermis. Electron microscopic studies of lesional skin obtained in infancy showed round or spindle-shaped mast cells with numerous fingerlike villous protrusions. The cytoplasmic granules varied in size and shape, and the appearance of degranulation was markedly noted. In the adult, most mast cells had markedly decreased numbers of granules and cytoplasmic villi. Some cells displayed degenerative or necrotic appearances.

"The low risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients dispensed corticosteroids. PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with corticosteroids. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding was assessed in a cohort of 19,880 patients from the Michigan Medicaid billing database with dermatitis and/or asthma treated with corticosteroids during 1980 to 1984. The frequency of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was assessed within 60 days after each corticosteroid prescription. RESULTS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients without a past history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were exposed to corticosteroids was only 2.8 cases per 10,000 person-months. The rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was notably higher in patients receiving anticoagulants and those with a prior history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (23.0 and 15.9 cases per 10,000 person-months, respectively). CONCLUSION: Because the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in ambulatory patients treated with corticosteroids is so low, prophylactic therapy should be restricted to high-risk patients, if it is to be used at all.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. A clinicopathologic study of 60 cases. Sixty cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) were analyzed clinicopathologically (24 VIN I, 9 VIN II, 27 VIN III). The ages of the patients ranged from 21 to 83 years (mean, 53.7). Colposcopic examinations showed the presence of white areas in 29 cases, red areas in 9, acetowhite areas in 6 and other alterations in 13. One-third of the lesions were multifocal.

"Cicatricial pemphigoid. Cicatricial pemphigoid is a subepidermal blistering disease that involves the mucous membranes and the skin. The oral cavity and the eye are most frequently involved. The clinical course is of long duration, and often there is significant scarring that can have devastating sequelae. The majority of the patients are elderly. The disease is characterized by the in vivo deposition of an anti-basement membrane zone antibody. The anti-basement membrane zone antibody cannot be detected in the circulation by routine laboratory techniques. The pathogenesis is poorly understood, and the cause is not known. Cicatricial pemphigoid may remain localized to the oral cavity or the eye or the skin (Brunsting-Perry variety), or it may be generalized. It rarely occurs in children, and it may be drug induced. Efforts must be made to differentiate cicatricial pemphigoid from bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, linear IgA bullous disease, and other vesiculobullous disease. Early recognition and treatment can improve the prognosis and avoid surgical intervention. Topical therapy is beneficial and expedites healing. Intralesional corticosteroids are effective and can help reduce the dose of systemic steroids. Most patients require systemic corticosteroid therapy. Dapsone is also useful in treating cicatricial pemphigoid, especially in patients in whom systemic steroids are ineffective or in whom they have to be discontinued because of side effects.

"Keratinocytes as initiators of inflammation  Environmental stimuli responsible for inducing cutaneous inflammation include contact allergens and ultraviolet light. We postulate that these diverse stimuli trigger a cutaneous inflammatory response by directly inducing epidermal keratinocytes to elaborate specific pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. The consequences are activation of dermal microvascular endothelial cells and selective accumulation of specific mononuclear cells in the dermis and epidermis. Thus, keratinocytes may act as ""signal transducers"", capable of converting exogenous stimuli into the production of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and chemotactic factors (acting in an autocrine and paracrine fashion) responsible for initiation of ""antigen-independent"" cutaneous inflammation. The initiation phase may facilitate or promote an amplification phase with additional production of tumour-necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma via an ""antigen-dependent"" pathway, and keratinocyte/T cell/antigen-presenting dendritic cellular associations. The direct activation of keratinocytes, with their ability to produce the complete repertoire of pro-inflammatory cytokines, can profoundly influence endogenous and recruited immunocompetent cells, thereby providing the critical trigger responsible for the swift and clinically dramatic alterations that occur following contact between the epidermis and a host of ""noxious"" agents.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"An open-label, dose-ranging trial of AL 721 in patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and AIDS-related complex. AL 721, a lipid mixture with reported in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via cell membrane or virion cholesterol depletion, was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging trial. Forty men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy or AIDS-related complex were treated with doses of 20, 30, 40, or 50 g orally twice daily for 8 weeks, and monitored for toxicity, disease progression, and with immunologic, virologic, and serum lipid profiles. The compound was found to be well tolerated over the broad range of doses examined; adverse reactions were confined to the gastrointestinal tract, of mild to moderate severity, and self-limited in duration. Modest weight gains observed on treatment were reversed within 4 weeks following cessation of therapy. While disease progression was not observed in this short-term study, we could find no indication of an immunorestorative or antiviral effect of AL 721, as determined by T-lymphocyte subset quantitation or HIV culture. All three patients who were HIV p24 antigenemic at entry retained positive antigen levels throughout treatment. As a consequence of therapy, however, significant increases in serum lipids were observed, including elevations in both triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. In conclusion, our experience on the largest group of HIV-infected patients treated with the highest doses of AL 721 provides no support for the use of this compound as an antiretroviral agent.",Virus_Diseases

The myelopathy associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection closely resembles that in subacute combined degeneration, a disorder of vitamin B12 metabolism. To investigate whether the disorders share a pathogenetic mechanism, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 20 HIV-seropositive patients and 30 HIV-negative patients who were undergoing lumbar puncture for other medical reasons. The HIV-seropositive patients had significantly lower CSF concentrations of SAM (mean 77 [SD 25] vs 131 [35] nmol/l; p less than 0.001) and significantly higher concentrations of SAH (30.5 [6.8] vs 19.0 [7.1] nmol/l; p less than 0.001) than the controls. There was therefore a significant difference between the groups in the SAM/SAH (methylation) ratio (HIV 2.7 [1.0] vs control 7.6 [3.4]; p less than 0.001). There were no correlations between SAM or SAH concentrations or methylation ratio and age or sex in both groups, or serum B12 and folate concentrations, CSF folate, serum or CSF methylmalonic acid, risk factors, body mass index, specific drug treatment received, or disease stage in the HIV group. This finding suggests that HIV affects the brain from a very early stage of the infection. We suggest that, as in the pig, the CSF methylation ratio closely reflects that in the brain. In HIV-infected patients a reduced brain methylation ratio would inhibit methyltransferase enzymes, which would lead to hypomethylation in the central nervous system and ultimately to neurological lesions. In a pig model of subacute combined degeneration and in vitamin-B12-deficient human beings, the primary cause of the low methylation ratio is impaired recycling of SAH back to SAM, a process which requires vitamin-B12-dependent methionine synthase. The HIV patients in this study were vitamin B12 and folate replete, which suggests a different cause for the low methylation ratio.",Virus_Diseases

"Seroprevalence of human T cell leukemia viruses in selected populations of homosexual men. This study sought to define the seroprevalence of human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II in selected populations of homosexual men. Serum specimens were screened for antibodies to HTLV and to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by enzyme immunoassay; successive testing of specimens with positive results was done by Western blotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) and then by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Of 1290 specimens, only 4 had antibodies against HTLV confirmed by RIPA. PCR analysis of DNA from PBMC from two subjects showed one to be HTLV-I and the other to be HTLV-II; both men also had HIV antibodies. These results demonstrate a lower seroprevalence rate for HTLV than some previous studies and emphasize the need for specific confirmatory tests.",Virus_Diseases
"Effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions in reducing emotional distress after human immunodeficiency virus antibody testing. To examine the effectiveness of three psychoeducational interventions in reducing emotional distress after voluntary serologic testing for human immunodeficiency virus-1,307 physically asymptomatic adults were randomly assigned to standard counseling, counseling plus a three-session interactive video program, or counseling plus six individual sessions of stress prevention training. Subjects were evaluated using five standardized distress measures at entry and 3 months later. Among the 204 human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative subjects, mean distress measures decreased significantly after all three interventions without differential treatment effects. Among the 103 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive subjects, mean distress measures decreased significantly after the stress prevention training and did not significantly increase in the other two interventions. We conclude that stress prevention training is particularly helpful after notification of human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity.",Virus_Diseases
"Randomized trial of salbutamol in acute bronchiolitis. To test whether nebulized salbutamol (albuterol) is safe and efficacious for the treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis, we enrolled 83 children (median age 6 months, range 1 to 21 months) in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Participants received two treatments at 30-minute intervals of either nebulized salbutamol (0.10 mg/kg in 2 ml 0.9% saline solution) or a similar volume of 0.9% saline solution placebo. Outcome measures were the respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and a clinical score based on the degree of wheezing and retractions. Patients in the salbutamol arm had significantly greater improvement in clinical scores after the initial treatment (p = 0.04). There was no difference between the groups in oxygen saturation (p = 0.74); patients treated with salbutamol had a small increase in heart rate after two treatments (159 +/- 16 vs 151 +/- 16; p = 0.03). We conclude that salbutamol is safe and effective for the initial treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis.",Virus_Diseases
"A double-blind, single-dose, crossover comparison of cetirizine, terfenadine, loratadine, astemizole, and chlorpheniramine versus placebo: suppressive effects on histamine-induced wheals and flares during 24 hours in normal subjects. We objectively tested the relative antihistaminic effects of cetirizine, 10 mg; terfenadine, 120 mg; terfenadine, 60 mg; loratadine, 10 mg; astemizole, 10 mg; chlorpheniramine, 4 mg; and placebo in healthy, male volunteers, mean age 25 +/- 4 years, and mean weight, 73 +/- 9 kg.

In this experimental model, the H1-receptor antagonists differed significantly with regard to time of onset of action, amount of suppression of the histamine-induced wheal and flare, and duration of action. The rank order was, from most effective to least effective, cetirizine, 10 mg; terfenadine, 120 mg; terfenadine, 60 mg; loratadine, 10 mg; astemizole, 10 mg; chlorpheniramine, 4 mg; and placebo.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Induction of inflammatory arthropathy resembling rheumatoid arthritis in mice transgenic for HTLV-I. Human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia and has also been suggested to be involved in other diseases such as chronic arthritis or myelopathy. To elucidate pathological roles of the virus in disease, transgenic mice were produced that carry the HTLV-I genome. At 2 to 3 months of age, many of the mice developed chronic arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial and periarticular inflammation with articular erosion caused by invasion of granulation tissues were marked. These observations suggest a possibility that HTLV-I is one of the etiologic agents of chronic arthritis in humans.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Antigen-presenting activity of draining lymph node cells from mice painted with a contact allergen during ultraviolet carcinogenesis. The induction of skin cancers in mice by chronic UV irradiation is accompanied by a decrease in the numbers of Ia+ and Thy-1+ dendritic cells in the epidermis early in the course of UV irradiation. Subsequently, the number of Ia+ cells, but not Thy-1+ cells, increases until the time of tumor development. To assess the functional significance of these changes in cutaneous immune cells, and to help define the role these cells may play in immune surveillance against skin cancers, we tested the afferent immunologic capability of the skin during the development of UV-B radiation-induced skin cancers. Afferent immune function was measured by testing the Ag-presenting capacity of draining lymph node (DLN) cells from mice sensitized epicutaneously with dinitrofluorobenzene. A reduced contact hypersensitivity response was induced in mice immunized with DLN cells from UV-irradiated mice that had been sensitized with hapten on UV-irradiated skin. This decreased reactivity was present during the entire latent period of tumor development. However, in tumor-bearing mice, the DLN cells from UV-irradiated, sensitized animals exhibited normal Ag-presenting activity. DLN cells from UV-irradiated mice sensitized on ventral, unirradiated skin exhibited normal Ag-presenting activity. The lowest amount of Ag-presenting activity in the draining lymph nodes of UV-irradiated mice correlated temporally with the lowest number of Ia+, adenosine triphosphatase+ dendritic epidermal cells in the UV-irradiated skin. At least during the early part of the tumor latent period, an increase in the number of these cells was paralleled by an increase in the Ag-presenting activity of the DLN cells. In contrast, the number of Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells in UV-irradiated skin did not correlate with the Ag-presenting activity. Thus, the decrease in the number of identifiable epidermal Langerhans cells early in the course of chronic UV irradiation correlated with a decrease in Ag-presenting activity after sensitization through the UV-irradiated skin. These studies demonstrate that the afferent arm of the cutaneous immune response is impaired in the site of tumor development throughout the latent period of UV carcinogenesis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis evolving into total lipodystrophy. A 15-year-old boy had persistent fever with severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorder, and marked elevation of lactate dehydrogenase values. A diagnosis of cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis was made after repeated skin biopsies. Three years after onset, he gradually lost 20 kg in body weight, and both skin and bone marrow specimens revealed degenerative changes of fatty tissue without any inflammatory cells. These findings suggest that total lipodystrophy syndrome results from the inflammatory destructive process of adipose tissue. To our knowledge, our report is the first to show, in a series of histologic studies, that an inflammatory destructive process may be involved in some cases of total lipodystrophy syndrome.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Generalized pustular psoriasis. A review of 63 cases. BACKGROUND--Sixty-three patients with generalized pustular psoriasis were hospitalized during a 29-year period. They were classified into four subgroups on the basis of onset and morphologic pattern of disease: acute (von Zumbusch), subacute annular, chronic (acral), and mixed. This division provides a better understanding of the variability of the disease and helps in choosing treatment. OBSERVATIONS--The average age at onset was 50 years; male and female patients were affected about equally. In 11 patients, flares were precipitated by localized infections. Approximately one fourth of the patients had complications; most were superinfections. The average stay in the hospital was 30 days; factors correlating with a long hospitalization were hypocalcemia, female sex, and a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris or pustular psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS--Whereas topical therapy was helpful, systemic medications were often needed. Coal tar, ultraviolet light, and psoralen-ultraviolet A may be effective; however, they must be used with caution, because they may exacerbate the disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Venous obstruction: an analysis of one hundred thirty-seven cases with hemodynamic, venographic, and clinical correlations. One hundred thirty-seven limbs with venous obstruction were analyzed. The arm/foot venous pressure differential and reactive hyperemia tests were found to be useful techniques to diagnose and grade venous obstruction. Traditional techniques including venography and ambulatory venous pressure are inferior in this regard. The newer techniques have provided newer insights in venous obstruction which are detailed herein. The hand-held Doppler was surprisingly very sensitive in grade I as well as in more severe forms of obstruction. Neither anatomic locale of obstruction nor its extent determined hemodynamic severity. Extensive proximal lesions could be hemodynamically mild, and conversely distal crural obstructions and single segment lesions could be hemodynamically severe. Phlebographic appearance was a poor index of collateralization. The paradoxical venous pressure response to the reactive hyperemia test in grade IV obstruction was found to be due to suppression or delay of the reactive hyperemia response itself in the presence of severe venous obstruction. The pain of venous claudication may be related to this phenomenon. Skin ulceration in the presence of venous obstruction was related to the associated reflux rather than the hemodynamic severity of the obstruction itself. The Linton procedure was found to be useful in treating such skin ulcerations. After perforator disruption, obstruction did not become hemodynamically worse, but reflux as measured by the Valsalva test improved with ulcer healing. The improvement in reflux related to Valsalva offers for the first time a hemodynamic rationale for the Linton procedure.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in semen from seropositive men using culture and polymerase chain reaction deoxyribonucleic acid amplification techniques. We have demonstrated that the polymerase chain reaction is a valid and sensitive technique for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in human semen. The combination of extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and liquid hybridization techniques used in this study was sensitive to a level of detection of one HIV-1 infected cell in 100,000 (or 3 infected cells/test sample). In a series of matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and semen cells from 25 HIV-1 seropositive homosexual men, HIV-1 DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 23 of 25 PBMC samples and 1 of 25 semen samples. By coculture on mitogen-activated peripheral blood leukocyte target cells, 19 of 24 PBMC and 4 of 24 semen samples were positive for infectious HIV-1. Of the four culture-positive semen samples, three were negative for the proviral form of the virus in the polymerase chain reaction assay. These data indicate that HIV-1 infected cells are not as prevalent in semen as in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, they indicate that the classical polymerase chain reaction approach, which only detects HIV-1 proviral DNA (infected cells), is not sufficient for clinical screening programs whose goal is the detection of HIV-1-infected semen samples. Accurate semen analysis by polymerase chain reaction may require enrichment of the infected cell population and/or a reverse transcriptase step to enable detection of the infectious ribonucleic acid form of the virus.",Virus_Diseases
"Pharmacokinetics of indium-111-labeled antimyosin monoclonal antibody in murine experimental viral myocarditis. The pharmacokinetics of indium-111-labeled antimyosin monoclonal antibody Fab were investigated with use of murine experimental viral myocarditis as a model. The biodistribution of indium-111-labeled antimyosin antibody Fab on days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after encephalomyocarditis virus inoculation demonstrated that myocardial uptake increased significantly on days 5, 7 and 14 (maximum on day 7) in infected versus uninfected mice (p less than 0.001). In vivo kinetics in infected mice on day 7 demonstrated that the heart to blood ratio reached a maximum 48 h after the intravenous administration of indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab, which was considered to be the optimal time for scintigraphy. The scintigraphic images obtained with indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab demonstrated positive uptake in the cardiac lesion in infected mice. The pathologic study demonstrated that myocardial uptake correlated well with pathologic grades of myocardial necrosis. High performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of an antigen-antibody complex in the circulation of infected mice after the injection of indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab. This antigen bound to indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab in the circulation might be whole myosin and this complex may decrease myocardial uptake and increase liver uptake. It is concluded that indium-111-labeled antimyosin monoclonal antibody Fab accumulates selectively in damaged heart tissue in mice with acute myocarditis and that indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab scintigraphy may be a useful method for the visualization of acute myocarditis.",Virus_Diseases
"Quality of life as a function of HIV classification. The purpose of this research was to identify variables related to life quality for persons with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and to ascertain if life quality differs according to the classifications of a positive serologic test for HIV antibodies (HIV+), AIDS-related complex (ARC), and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). A convenience sampling technique was used to obtain subjects from AIDS support groups and affiliated agencies in a major southwest urban area. Ninety-five HIV-infected subjects completed a demographic data sheet, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), and the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS). The majority of subjects (59%) listed AIDS as their category of diagnosis, 25% were HIV+ only and 16% identified ARC as their disease classification. Subjects had SIP and SDS scores which indicated HIV-infection significantly affected their quality of life. Multivariate results indicated that quality of life indicators varied as a function of HIV classification. HIV-infection had the greatest disruption in psychosocial aspects of life.

"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in black children--a review of 18 cases. Despite the fact that measles is severe and presents in very young Black children in Natal, South Africa, no case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was reported from this region prior to 1982. A retrospective study was therefore made over the six-year period 1982-1987 of 18 patients who presented to the King Edward VIII teaching hospital, Durban, with clinical and laboratory features of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The majority of patients (66 per cent) were between 8 and 12 years of age. The mean age of onset was 9.3 years, the youngest patient being four years nine months and the oldest 14 years. The male to female ratio was 1.25:1. A previous history of primary measles infection was obtained in 44.4 per cent of cases; 62.5 per cent occurred before the second birthday. The commonest mode of presentation was personality, intellectual and behaviour disorders (83 per cent) followed by myoclonic seizures (61 per cent) and choreiform movements (28 per cent). Measles antibody was present in the CSF in all cases. The EEG was abnormal in all recorded cases with pathognomonic periodic complexes being found in 56.2 per cent.

"Plasma histamine in patients with chronic renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. Plasma histamine concentrations were measured using a commercially available monoclonal antibody radioimmunoassay in 38 patients with nephrotic syndrome, end stage renal failure, those receiving haemodialysis, and those receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis to determine whether histamine may mediate damage to glomerular capillaries and arterial endothelium. Plasma histamine concentrations were significantly increased in all four patient groups when compared with those of controls and were the highest in two patients with pruritus. Raised plasma histamine concentrations in such patients are consistent with the hypothesis that histamine may contribute to the damage to glomerular capillaries and to arterial endothelium. These effects may be relevant to the pathogenesis of glomerular disease and atherosclerosis.

To ascertain the prevalence of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection and the occurrence of diseases caused by HTLV-I in the Solomon Islands, we tested 1141 sera from 851 patients (317 females and 534 males), who were hospitalized at the Central Hospital in Honiara between February 1984 and November 1988, for antibodies to HTLV-I using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sera from 69 of 81 ELISA-positive patients and from 56 ELISA-negative patients were then tested by Western analysis. As verified by strict Western immunoblot criteria, the overall HTLV-I seroprevalence was 2.2% (19/851). Age- and gender-specific prevalence data indicated an age-related acquisition of infection with no sexual predominance. No diagnosis category was over-represented among the seropositive patients. HTLV-I-specific antibodies were found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from one of six patients with spastic paraparesis. As in other Melanesian populations, the majority of ELISA-positive sera could not be confirmed by Western analysis. Reactivity to three or more gag-encoded proteins was found in 85% (45/53) of ELISA-positive, Western blot-indeterminate sera, and 30% (16/53) reacted to p19 and an env gene product but lacked reactivity to p24.

"Partial sequence of a candidate gene for the Marfan syndrome  Fibrillin is a large (relative molecular mass 350,000) glycoprotein which can be isolated from fibroblast cell cultures and is a component of the microfibrils that are ubiquitous in the connective tissue space. The microfibrils of the suspensory ligament of the lens as well as the elastic fibre microfibrils of the blood vessel wall are composed of fibrillin. The ocular and cardiovascular manifestations of the Marfan syndrome are consistent with a defect in the gene coding for a structural constituent of these connective tissues. Immunohistological experiments have recently implicated fibrillin microfibrils in the pathogenesis of the Marfan syndrome. Genetic linkage data localizing the Marfan gene to chromosome 15 and the in situ hybridization of fibrillin complementary DNA to 15q21.1 together support fibrillin as a candidate Marfan gene.

"Management of patients and side effects during cyclosporine therapy for cutaneous disorders. Cyclosporine has been used in the experimental treatment of multiple inflammatory diseases of presumed autoimmune origin, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, Graves' disease, and myasthenia gravis. In dermatology, the drug has been used successfully as primary therapy for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, alopecia areata, pyoderma gangrenosum, Behcet's disease, atopic dermatitis, and lichen planus. At a dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg per day, cyclosporine is well tolerated by most patients.

"The source and significance of raised serum enzymes in rheumatoid arthritis. Hepatobiliary dysfunction in rheumatoid arthritis has been suggested on the basis of raised serum activity of alkaline phosphatase, 5-nucleotidase, lactic dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, but a specific pathological lesion has not been demonstrated and serum transaminases and bilirubin are almost invariably normal. This paper reports a series of studies designed to determine the tissues of origin of the enzymes and offers an alternative interpretation of the enzymological findings. The results suggest that only alkaline phosphatase originates from the liver, while lactic dehydrogenase and 5-nucleotidase originate from synovial fluid polymorphs and synovial lining cells, respectively. Serum alkaline phosphatase may be induced by inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 because it correlates with the acute phase response. Serum lactic dehydrogenase is an integrated measure of polymorph lysis in all joints and offers a marker of joint inflammation more specific than measures such as the ESR. Levels of serum 5-nucleotidase provide information about the activity of the synovium. Finally, because hepatic necrosis does not normally occur, the transaminases may be used to monitor drug toxicity.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Structural requirements for recognition of the HLA-Dw14 class II epitope: a key HLA determinant associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Although HLA genes have been shown to be associated with certain diseases, the basis for this association is unknown. Recent studies, however, have documented patterns of nucleotide sequence variation among some HLA genes associated with a particular disease. For rheumatoid arthritis, HLA genes in most patients have a shared nucleotide sequence encoding a key structural element of an HLA class II polypeptide; this sequence element is critical for the interaction of the HLA molecule with antigenic peptides and with responding T cells, suggestive of a direct role for this sequence element in disease susceptibility. We describe the serological and cellular immunologic characteristics encoded by this rheumatoid arthritis-associated sequence element. Site-directed mutagenesis of the DRB1 gene was used to define amino acids critical for antibody and T-cell recognition of this structural element, focusing on residues that distinguish the rheumatoid arthritis-associated alleles Dw4 and Dw14 from a closely related allele, Dw10, not associated with disease. Both the gain and loss of rheumatoid arthritis-associated epitopes were highly dependent on three residues within a discrete domain of the HLA-DR molecule. Recognition was most strongly influenced by the following amino acids (in order): 70 greater than 71 greater than 67. Some alloreactive T-cell clones were also influenced by amino acid variation in portions of the DR molecule lying outside the shared sequence element.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Both extent and activity of dermatitis were significantly improved (p less than 0.001) as were subjective measures of disease. 20 patients receiving cyclosporin reported adverse events compared with 8 taking placebo, although no patient required withdrawal from the study. Cyclosporin therapy led to an increase in the mean serum urea, creatinine, and bilirubin concentrations, although only the rise in bilirubin was significant (p = 0.001). Our results confirm that cyclosporin is a safe and effective short-term treatment for severe, refractory atopic dermatitis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Survivorship analysis of total knee arthroplasty. Cumulative rates of survival of 9200 total knee arthroplasties. From 1971 through 1987, 9200 total knee arthroplasties were performed at the Mayo Clinic. Actuarial analysis was used to estimate cumulative rates of survival. Use of a proportional-hazard, general linear model led to the identification of four independent variables that were associated with a significantly lower risk of failure: primary total knee arthroplasty, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, an age of sixty years or more, and use of a condylar prosthesis with a metal-backed tibial component. When all four of these favorable variables were present (without regard for radiographic changes and non-disabling symptoms), the probability of an implant being in situ was 97 per cent at both five and ten years.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Small intestinal function and dietary status in dermatitis herpetiformis. Small intestinal morphology and function were assessed in 82 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, 51 of whom were taking a normal diet and 31 a gluten free diet. Methods used were histopathological evaluation of jejunal mucosal biopsy specimens, quantitation of intraepithelial lymphocytes, cellobiose/mannitol permeability test, tissue disaccharidase values, serum antigliadin antibodies, and formal assessment of dietary gluten content by a dietician. There was no correlation between dietary gluten intake and the degree of enteropathy in the 51 patients taking a normal diet, whereas biopsy specimens were normal in 24 of the 31 patients on a gluten free diet, all previously having been abnormal. Eighteen patients on gluten containing diets had normal jejunal histology and in seven of these all tests of small intestinal morphology and function were entirely normal. Intestinal permeability was abnormal and serum antigliadin antibodies were present in most patients with enteropathy. Studies of acid secretion in seven patients showed that hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria did not lead to abnormal permeability in the absence of enteropathy. This study shows that a combination of objective tests of small intestinal architecture and function will detect abnormalities in most dermatitis herpetiformis patients, including some with histologically normal jejunal biopsy specimens. Nevertheless there is a small group in whom all conventional intestinal investigations are entirely normal.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Sulfadiazine-induced crystalluria in AIDS patients with toxoplasma encephalitis. Toxoplasma encephalitis is the most common opportunistic infection of the central nervous system in patients with AIDS. The treatment of choice is a combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine. We present here four patients with AIDS treated for toxoplasmic encephalitis who developed sulfadiazine-induced crystalluria. This complication was rapidly reversible with rehydration and urine alkalinization. Patients with AIDS treated with high doses of sulfadiazine should be adequately hydrated, and their urinary pH maintained above 7.5 to prevent sulfadiazine-induced crystalluria.",Virus_Diseases
"Measles incidence, vaccine efficacy, and mortality in two urban African areas with high vaccination coverage. Measles incidence, vaccine efficacy, and mortality were examined prospectively in two districts in Bissau where vaccine coverage for children aged 12-23 months was 81% (Bandim 1) and 61% (Bandim 2). There was little difference in cumulative measles incidence before 9 months of age (6.1% and 7.6%, respectively). Between 9 months and 2 years of age, however, 6.1% contracted measles in Bandim 1 and 13.7% in Bandim 2. Even adjusting for vaccination status, incidence was significantly higher in Bandim 2 (relative risk 1.6, P = .04). Even though 95% of the children had measles antibodies after vaccination, vaccine efficacy was not more than 68% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39%-84%) and was unrelated to age at vaccination. Unvaccinated children had a mortality hazard ratio of 3.0 compared with vaccinated children (P = .002), indicating a protective efficacy against death of 66% (CI 32%-83%) of measles vaccination. These data suggest that it will be necessary to vaccinate before age 9 months to control measles in hyperendemic urban African areas.",Virus_Diseases
"Morphological and histopathological aspects of aneurysms after patch aortoplasty for coarctation. Repair of coarctation of the aorta by synthetic patch grafting has been complicated by late aneurysm formation. These aneurysms differ macroscopically from atherosclerotic thoracic aortic dilatations. Specimens for microscopic examination were taken from 14 of 20 patients undergoing aneurysm resection. Histological analysis of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients (93%), foreign body reaction in 11 patients (78%), and intimal thickening in 3 patients (21%). The three layers of the aortic wall could be identified in the aneurysms. On the basis of these results, we discuss the etiologic factors and pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of these aneurysms.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"HIV associated arthropathy: HIV antigen demonstration in the synovial membrane. Light and electron microscopic studies were performed on the synovial membranes of 5 patients with HIV associated arthropathy. An immunoperoxidase technique with the use of monoclonal antibodies against CD4, CD8, B and DR lymphocytes, and HIV p24 antigen was also used. Mild to moderate nonspecific proliferative changes and increased vascularity of the subsynovial space were seen. Electron dense deposits and viral-like particles were not observed. Immunohistochemical staining revealed HIV p24 positive staining in cells of the synovial lining layer and in the mononuclear cells of the subsynovial space. CD4, CD8, with predominance of CD8, and B and DR cells were also present. The presence of HIV p24 antigen may be indicative of a role, yet to be defined, in the pathogenesis of HIV associated rheumatic disorders.",Virus_Diseases
"In-vivo epidermal nuclear reactions: a selective process. Epidermal in-vivo nuclear reactions of IgG occur primarily in patients with mixed connective tissue disease or systemic lupus erythematosus and have been associated with high titres of circulating antibodies to ribonucleoprotein (RNP). This study was carried out to examine whether these epidermal nuclear reactions are true or simply an excision artefact. We observed the epidermal nuclear reactions for IgG only and not for other immunoglobulins in both in-vivo and in-vitro organ-culture studies, despite the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) of all immunoglobulin classes. The association of the in-vitro epidermal nuclear reactions with serum RNP antibodies, although not absolute was statistically significant. The absorption of the serum with extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) preparation diminished the nuclear reactivity on tissue explants. In addition, the penetration of ANA into the nuclei of skin explants was both time and temperature dependent and was inhibited by sodium azide and by oligomycin. We conclude that the epidermal nuclear staining reactions observed by direct immunofluorescence on skin biopsies is selective and that the penetration of IgG into the epidermal cell nuclei is an active process and not an artefact.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Intraoperative anaphylaxis: an association with latex sensitivity. Latex products have recently been identified as the cause of severe intraoperative anaphylactic reactions. We have identified a group of pediatric patients who appear to be at increased risk for such reactions. Fifteen patients with either spina bifida or congenital urologic abnormalities experienced 19 intraoperative anaphylactic reactions. All patients had frequent previous exposures to rubber materials since infancy as part of their management and/or investigative procedures. Seven of 15 patients had a previous history of local skin reactions to rubber. Only four patients were atopic. All patients had undergone multiple (two of 26) operative procedures before their reactions, the onset of which ranged from 40 to 290 minutes after induction of anesthesia. The reactions varied in intensity from urticaria to severe cardiorespiratory collapse. All these patients subsequently had positive allergy skin tests and positive RAST to latex antigen. We conclude that this group is at risk when they are exposed to latex intraoperatively as a result of frequent past exposure to these materials. Allergic evaluation for latex allergy may assist in the preoperative evaluation of similar patients. In sensitized patients, appropriate prophylactic measures, particularly the avoidance of latex, is required.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Incidence of hairy cell leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in first known HTLV-II-endemic population. Unlike human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I), HTLV-II has not been convincingly linked to a malignancy. In the first 10 months of serologic screening for HTLV-I/II among blood donors in New Mexico in 1988-1989, HTLV-I/II infection was found in 27 donors. HTLV-I/II infection was present in 1.0%-1.6% of American Indian and 0.16%-0.27% of Hispanic donors compared with 0.009%-0.06% of non-Hispanic white donors. HTLV-II was identified by DNA amplification in 12 of 13 samples from Indian and Hispanic seropositive donors. Despite apparent endemic HTLV-II infection in these populations, New Mexico Tumor Registry data showed that the incidences of hairy cell leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were comparable among the three ethnic groups. A population with endemic HTLV-II infection has been identified, and there is no evidence of increased risk for these three malignancies in the endemic groups.",Virus_Diseases
"Study design considerations for ribavirin: efficacy studies. Five placebo-controlled double-blind studies, each including approximately 30 subjects, have addressed the question of the effect of aerosolized ribavirin on the course of RSV lower respiratory infection in infancy. The fact that each was able to establish a beneficial effect despite the small number of subjects studied is convincing evidence that such an effect exists. The studies from Rochester using oximetry and an analog illness severity scale indicate that this effect is both statistically significant and clinically relevant. These tools are reliable and easily applicable measures for multicenter studies when illness severity is selected as an outcome measure. Characteristics that should be taken into consideration when assigning experimental groups include age, sex, a history of prematurity or underlying conditions and arterial oxygen saturation. Future studies will address additional questions about the efficacy of ribavirin, such as its role in critically ill children, the economic benefits of its use in terms of duration of hospitalization, the usefulness of early treatment of RSV disease in high risk infants, and the impact of treatment on long-term consequences of RSV infection. These studies may require outcome variables and subject selection strategies different from those used in earlier studies.",Virus_Diseases
"Interferon therapy for acute posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis: response with respect to anti-hepatitis C virus antibody status. To assess the effect of interferon therapy on posttransfusion non-A, non-B acute hepatitis, we examined the appearance of serum hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) and abnormal serum aminotransferase levels after the onset of hepatitis in 12 patients treated with interferon and in 46 patients treated conservatively. Eleven patients were given 3 million units of human fibroblast beta-interferon three times weekly for 4 wk and 1 was given one million units of human lymphoblastoid alpha-interferon daily for 3 months. In the interferon-treated patients, the effect of therapy on hepatic histology was also assessed. Detection of anti-HCV within 6 and 12 months after the onset of hepatitis was less common in interferon-treated patients than in control patients (6/12 vs 35/46 and 5/12 vs 35/46, both p = NS). At 24 months after the onset of hepatitis, anti-HCV levels were significantly lower in interferon-treated patients (0/10, p less than 0.05), but had not changed significantly in control patients (34/46). Abnormal serum aminotransferase levels at 6, 12, and 24 months after the onset of hepatitis were significantly less common in interferon-treated patients than in controls (25% vs 78.3%, p less than 0.005; 25% vs 71.7%, p less than 0.01; and 0% vs 67.4%, p less than 0.001). The percentage of abnormal serum aminotransferase levels at 6, 12, and 24 months after onset of hepatitis was also less in interferon-treated patients than in control patients, both among anti-HCV-positive patients (50% vs 85.7%, p = NS; 50% vs 80%, p = NS; and 0% vs 77.1%, p less than 0.01) and among anti-HCV-negative patients (0% vs 54.5%, p = NS; 0% vs 45.5%, p = NS; and 0% vs 27.3%, p = NS). Immediately after interferon therapy, the histological activity index dropped from 6.0 +/- 4.2 to 4.8 +/- 2.5 in anti-HCV-positive patients (p = NS) and from 4.2 +/- 4.3 to 2.6 +/- 1.7 in anti-HCV-negative patients (p = NS). Biopsy specimens obtained from four patients 12-23 months after interferon therapy revealed normal histology in one anti-HCV-positive patient and two anti-HCV-negative patients, and marked improvement in the other anti-HCV-positive patient. These results indicate that short-term, low-dose interferon therapy may be effective for posttransfusion non-A, non-B acute hepatitis (both anti-HCV-positive and anti-HCV-negative).",Virus_Diseases
"Peptide-induced antiviral protection by cytotoxic T cells. A specific antiviral cytotoxic immune response in vivo could be induced by the subcutaneous injection of the T-cell epitope of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) nucleoprotein as an unmodified free synthetic peptide (Arg-Pro-Gln-Ala-Ser-Gly-Val-Tyr-Met-Gly-Asn-Leu-Thr-Ala-Gln) emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. This immunization rendered mice into a LCMV-specific protective state as shown by the inhibition of LCMV replication in spleens of such mice. The protection level of these mice correlated with the ability to respond to the peptide challenge by CD8+ virus-specific cytotoxic T cells. This is a direct demonstration that peptide vaccines can be antivirally protective in vivo, thus encouraging further search for appropriate mixtures of stable peptides that may be used as T-cell vaccines.",Virus_Diseases
"A capture enzyme immunoassay for detection of HIV-2/SIV antigen. An antigen capture enzyme immunoassay was developed for the demonstration of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The assay (HIV-2 CE) has a sensitivity of approximately 250 pg/ml of HIV-2/SIV antigen. The HIV-2 CE was 4-16 times more sensitive than the Abbott HIV-1 antigen assay for detection of HIV-2/SIV antigen in cell culture supernatant. The sensitivity for detection of HIV-2/SIV antigen in serum or plasma was 98.5% in the HIV-2 CE and 95.5% in the Abbott HIV-1 antigen assay. The specificity of the HIV-2 CE was 99.2% (one false positive among 119 negative sera) whereas the Abbott assay was 100% specific. The HIV-2 CE detected antigen in supernatants from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of macaque monkeys infected with HIV-2 or SIV about 1 week before a reverse transcriptase (RT) microassay was positive and remained positive for at least 1 week after the RT assay had become negative. Three cultures from persistently infected monkeys were positive only in the HIV-2 CE, reflecting a higher sensitivity compared to the RT microassay. Thus, the HIV-2 CE was more sensitive than the Abbott HIV-1 antigen assay for detection of HIV-2/SIV antigen in culture supernatants as well as in serum/plasma. Furthermore, the HIV-2 CE showed a higher sensitivity than the RT microassay for detection of HIV-2/SIV in cell culture supernatants.",Virus_Diseases
"Ultrastructural localization of calcium in psoriatic and normal human epidermis. With ion capture cytochemistry, we previously demonstrated the distribution of calcium ions in murine epidermis, a pattern consistent with a role for this ion in the regulation of epidermal differentiation. Because of the known proliferation and differentiation defects in psoriasis, we compared the calcium distribution of involved vs uninvolved psoriatic lesions and normal human epidermis. Whereas normal human and uninvolved psoriatic epidermis revealed increased calcium-containing precipitates in the uppermost stratum granulosum, in contrast the basal layer of psoriatic lesions contained less extracellular calcium, a condition that favored enhanced proliferation. Moreover, all psoriatic suprabasal cell layers displayed heavier than normal concentrations of calcium, indicating loss of the normal calcium gradient that programs terminal differentiation. This abnormal profile may account for the differentiation defects (eg, parakeratosis) that occur in psoriasis. Finally, psoriatic lesions displayed retained ionic Ca in intercellular domains of the upper stratum granulosum with absence of normal intercellular bilayers, findings that may underlie the abnormal desquamation and permeability barrier in psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Localization of neutrophil-activating peptide-1/interleukin-8-immunoreactivity in normal and psoriatic skin. Various cytokines have in the past been detected in human skin. Among these, the neutrophil-activating peptide NAP-1/IL-8 is a potent 8-kD proinflammatory peptide that has been purified from psoriatic scales. Its chemotactic activity on human neutrophils, as well as its presence in psoriatic scales, may relate to a role in this disease. In the present study, the tissue distribution of the peptide was examined immunohistochemically using two monoclonal antibodies (52E8, 46E5) recently produced and characterized in our laboratory. Immunoreactivity was detected in both normal and psoriatic skin, resulting in uniform suprabasal keratinocyte staining in normal skin with 52E8 and of all keratinocytes with 46E5. Immunoreactivity in psoriasis correlated to the inflammatory tissue reaction, varying from uniform absence in highly active psoriasis to focally weak staining in plaque type psoriasis. Cells of the acrosyringium and hair follicles were always positive and were unaffected by the inflammatory activity. Epidermal immunoreactivity detected in this study may be associated with closely related peptides of the IL8 family or with truncated or extended forms of NAP-1/IL-8.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Isolation and identification of viral agents in Argentinian children with acute lower respiratory tract infection. From a total population of 1,002 children with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI), identification of virus was achieved in 304 cases. In this survey, 1,000 nasopharyngeal aspirate and 13 lung tissue samples were tested in four cell lines (HEp-2, MRC-5, MDCK, and LLC-MK2) and by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), while 242 paired sera were studied by complement fixation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected agent (n = 183), followed by adenovirus (n = 28), parainfluenza (n = 5) and 3 (n = 16) viruses, and influenza A (n = 10) and B (n = 4) viruses. The sensitivity and specificity of IIF identification vs. isolation in cell culture were high for RSV (91.5% and 94.9%, respectively). However, IIF proved poorly sensitive for detection of adenovirus (sensitivity, 23.8%; specificity, 100%). The complement-fixation test proved the least effective, with a sensitivity of only 41.5%. Therefore, on the basis of our experience, it appears that the yield for positive diagnosis of virus is increased if both isolation in multiple cell lines and identification by means of IIF are used. Our survey provides for the first time reliable data on the viral etiology of ALRI in Argentina, as determined by three different methods.",Virus_Diseases
"Immunopathology and viral reactivation. A general theory of schizophrenia. A theory is proposed that explains a broad range of clinical manifestations in schizophrenia. It is a heuristic device for organizing research in the neuroimmunology and virology of schizophrenia. This approach is different from other immune and viral theories of schizophrenia and defines testable hypotheses for further theory refinement or rejection. Defective alpha-interferon (aIFN) regulation resulting in excessive effect is postulated to cause schizophrenia. The role of aIFN in the regulation of development and its induction within the brain by the reactivation of viruses that are commonly present in the normal central nervous system (CNS) are the primary pathophysiological mechanisms. Biological properties of aIFN include neural excitation, opiate and adrenocorticotropic hormone activity, and inhibition of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Psychosis results from in situ viral stimulation of aIFN production in the CNS of a vulnerable host having defective regulation of either sensitivity or production. Negative symptoms result from aIFN effects on CNS development and the behavioral toxicity of aIFN. Biological developmental abnormalities, gender differences in severity, and decline in psychotic symptoms with age are discussed in the context of the theory. Research strategies and specific testable hypotheses are presented.",Virus_Diseases
"Cyclosporin A in combination with photochemotherapy (PUVA) in the treatment of psoriasis. Forty patients with relapsing plaque psoriasis involving more than 20% body surface were treated either with cyclosporin A (CyA) plus PUVA or the retinoid etretinate plus PUVA (RePUVA). They initially received either CyA (2 weeks) or etretinate (1 week) alone and then PUVA was given concomitantly until complete remission. The patients were monitored over a period of 6 months and any relapse recorded. With each combined treatment regimen, CyA plus PUVA and RePUVA, the patients cleared within comparable periods of time (mean treatment period of 5.3 vs. 4.7 weeks after initiation of therapy and 3.3 vs. 3.7 weeks after initiation of PUVA). However, the cumulative UVA dose required for clearance (110.9 J/cm2 vs. 62.1 J/cm2 (P less than 0.05)) and the incidence of severe and early relapses were significantly higher in the CyA cohort. Within 6 months severe relapses had occurred in 58% of CyA plus PUVA but only in 15% of RePUVA-treated patients (P less than 0.001). This suggests that the CyA plus PUVA regimen as performed in this study is less effective than RePUVA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Anti-interleukin-1 alpha autoantibodies in humans: characterization, isotype distribution, and receptor-binding inhibition--higher frequency in Schnitzler's syndrome (urticaria and macroglobulinemia). Since autoantibodies (Abs) to cytokines may modify their biologic activities, high-affinity binding factors for interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha BF) were characterized in human sera. IL-1 alpha BF was identified as IgG (1) by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation followed by immunodiffusion autoradiography, (2) by ligand-blotting method, (3) by ligand binding to affinity-immobilized serum IgG, and (4) by IgG affinity purification followed by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. IL-1 alpha binding activity resided in the F(ab)2 fragment. The apparent equilibrium constant was in the range of IgG found after immunization with conventional antigens (i.e., 10(-9) to 10(-10) mol/L). Anti-IL-1 alpha IgG auto-Abs represented only an extremely small fraction of total IgG (less than 1/10(-5)). Some sera with IL-1 alpha BF and purified IgG thereof were able to inhibit by 96% to 98% the binding of human recombinant IL-1 alpha to its receptor on murine thymoma EL4-6.1 cells, whereas other sera did not. When 125I-labeled anti-IL-1 alpha IgG complexes were injected into rats, they prolonged the plasma half-life of 125I-labeled IL-1 alpha several fold and altered its tissue distribution. The predominant class was IgG (12/19), mainly IgG4 (9/19), but in five of the sera, anti-IL-1 alpha IgA was also detected. In a screening of 271 sera, IL-1 alpha BF was detected in 17/98 normal subjects and was not more frequent in several control groups of patients, except in patients with Schnitzler's syndrome (fever, chronic urticaria, bone pain, and monoclonal IgM paraprotein) (6/9; p less than 0.005).

"Ulcerated anogenital hemangioma of infancy. Ten female infants were referred for symptomatic hemangiomas in the anogenital area. (One had had steroid treatment prior to consultation.) The natural history of these lesions is well known. Virtually all will spontaneously involute over a period of years. However, the lesions reported were particularly troublesome because of repeated ulcerations and subsequent pain. Prior treatment had been local wound care with antibiotic ointment and Telfa-type dressings. After referral from a family practitioner or pediatrician, argon laser treatment was performed in an outpatient setting. Eight of the 10 patients were treated with local anesthesia, and 2 had general anesthesia. All lesions healed in 1 to 5 weeks. No patients referred during this period were excluded from this series. All who received treatment were included. All the lesions involuted following treatment. In our estimation, the final result is identical to what may be expected after spontaneous involution of an ulcerated or infected hemangioma. The major difference is that involution occurred in a few weeks in laser-treated patients rather than a period of months or years. Ulcerated hemangiomas of the anogenital area have significant morbidity that can be efficiently avoided with the use of argon laser therapy. Lesions of the anogenital area have a strong predilection for females.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Successful culture of adult human melanocytes obtained from normal and vitiligo donors. The development of growth conditions for human melanocytes from uninvolved skin from vitiligo patients and age-matched normal adults is a prerequisite to understanding the etiology of this pigmentary disorder. By using new growth conditions, pure melanocyte cultures were prepared from normal adults and the pigmented skin of vitiligo donors. Both cell types grew without a lag period and were maintained for more than six months (4-8 passages). The cultures could be expanded from several thousand melanocytes in the original cell suspension to several million cells (2-7 x 10(6] in pure culture. To obtain these results, the current standard conditions for the culture of fetal melanocytes were substantially modified. MEM-S medium was less satisfactory than MCDB-153. Adult normal and vitiligo cells also required the presence of exogenous catalase (20 micrograms/ml) during isolation and primary seeding. Thereafter, this enzyme was not necessary. Melanocytes grew best and gave the highest yields if the concentrations of both calcium (200 microM) and the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were low (4-8 nM). Other growth factors included in the MCDB-153 media were bFGF, crude bovine pituitary extract, insulin, transferrin, hydrocortisone, 5% FCS, and the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol. Cholera toxin and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) were omitted from the MCDB-153 growth medium because they slowed down growth even at very low concentrations. The results indicate adult and vitiligo melanocytes can be cultured. Preliminary studies of the normal and vitiligo cells indicate that vitiligo melanocytes retain some of the ultrastructural abnormalities observed in skin even when grown in culture.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Spontaneous rheumatoid-like arthritis in a line of mice sensitive to collagen-induced arthritis. Twenty-eight percent of 13-month-old male mice of the high antibody responder line of Biozzi's selection I (HI) spontaneously developed a long-lasting inflammatory arthritis. This disease was clinically and histologically similar to human rheumatoid arthritis. The synovium of joints and some tendons was hypertrophied, with thickening of the synovial cell layer and infiltration by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes. In some cases, synovial pannus formation led to destructive damage of articular cartilage and bone. Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, anti-DNA, and anti-type II collagen (CII) antibodies were often found in the sera of both arthritic mice and clinically normal littermates. The presence of CII autoantibodies in this line of mice suggests that a potentially harmful anti-CII T cell autoimmunity can also develop spontaneously and lead to joint damage. Moreover, HI mice are also susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis, while a closely related mouse line (HII) is resistant to both diseases. These data support the hypothesis that collagen-induced arthritis is pathogenetically related both to this spontaneous arthritis and to rheumatoid arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Bile porphyrin analysis in the evaluation of variegate porphyria  BACKGROUND: Variegate porphyria is a genetic disorder of porphyrin metabolism in which patients may have both neurologic dysfunction and photocutaneous lesions. Biochemical confirmation of the diagnosis can be difficult, particularly in patients without neurologic dysfunction at the time of testing. The demonstration of increased fecal excretion of porphyrin is frequently used for this purpose, but levels may be normal. Since elevated fecal porphyrin levels in variegate porphyria are presumably a consequence of increased biliary excretion, we evaluated whether analysis of porphyrins in bile distinguishes better between patients with variegate porphyria and controls. METHODS: Bile samples were collected by duodenal aspiration from 10 patients with proved variegate porphyria who had no neurologic symptoms when they were studied and 17 control subjects. Bile and fecal porphyrin levels were measured fluorometrically. RESULTS: The mean total porphyrin concentration in bile in the patients with variegate porphyria was significantly higher than that in the controls (67.8 vs. 0.71 mumol per liter; P less than 0.00002). There was more than a ninefold difference between the highest level in any control subject and the lowest level in any patient with variegate porphyria. The mean fecal porphyrin level in the patients with variegate porphyria also differed significantly from that in the controls (0.79 vs. 0.14 mumol per gram of dry weight; P less than 0.007), but four patients had levels within the control range. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of porphyrin in bile is higher in patients with variegate porphyria than in controls, and the difference is greater than that for fecal porphyrin. Bile porphyrin measurements may be helpful in the evaluation of asymptomatic patients suspected of having variegate porphyria.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Long-term results of posterior release surgery for severe flexion contracture of the knee in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Twelve knees in nine rheumatoid patients with severe flexion contractures were evaluated clinically and roentgenographically for an average of 17.2 years (range, six to 25 years) after posterior release surgery. Preoperatively, the average extension in the 12 knees was 42.5 degrees, and postoperatively it was 10.8 degrees. Even though patients were able to walk postoperatively, the majority had knee pain when they extended their knees soon after surgery. Seven knees required further surgery after correction of the flexion deformity. The average time before reconstructive surgery after posterior release was 11.1 months. In the treatment of severe flexion deformities of the knee in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, posterior release surgery was effective only in correcting the deformity. Posterior subluxation of the tibia, knee pain, and instability occurred soon after surgery. Therefore, patients may require additional reconstructive surgery soon after the posterior release.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hematologic aspects of mastocytosis: I: Bone marrow pathology in adult and pediatric systemic mast cell disease. The typical bone marrow lesions seen in adults with systemic mast cell disease (SMCD) are foci of spindle-shaped mast cells in a fibrotic matrix and are found in up to 90% of adults with SMCD. Lymphocytes and eosinophils frequently are admixed with the mast cells, forming the classic MEL lesion. The mast cell lesions can be found in perivascular, peritrabecular or intertrabecular locations and may on occasion completely replace intratrabecular regions of the marrow. In contrast, the mast cell lesions found in children with cutaneous mast cell disorders are uniformly small and subtle and are most frequently located perivascularly. Lymphocytes, eosinophils, and early myeloid elements may be associated with these lesions.

The clinical and histologic effects of a new emollient cream formulation of topical tretinoin at concentrations of 0.05% and 0.01% were examined in 251 subjects with mild to moderate photodamaged facial skin in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter study. Seventy-nine percent of the subjects who received 0.05% tretinoin for 24 weeks showed overall improvement in photodamaged skin compared with improvement in 48% of the vehicle-treated control subjects. Significant reductions were found in fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, roughness, and laxity after 0.05% tretinoin therapy when compared with controls. In addition, histologic changes of increased epidermal thickness, decreased melanin content, and stratum corneum compaction provide independent evidence supporting clinical improvement. Side effects of erythema, peeling, and stinging were usually mild and well tolerated.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Upper respiratory tract infections in young children: duration of and frequency of complications. This study was performed to determine the usual duration of community-acquired viral upper respiratory tract infections and the incidence of complications (otitis media/sinusitis) of these respiratory tract infections in infancy and early childhood. Children in various forms of child-care arrangements (home care, group care, and day care) were enrolled at birth and observed for 3 years. Families were telephoned every 2 weeks to record on a standardized form the type and severity of illnesses experienced during the previous interval. Only children remaining in their original child-care group for the entire study period were compared. The mean duration of an upper respiratory tract infection varied between 6.6 days (for 1- to 2-year-old children in home care) and 8.9 days (for children younger than 1 year in day care). The percentage of apparently simple upper respiratory tract infections that lasted more than 15 days ranged from 6.5% (for 1- to 3-year-old children in home care) to 13.1% (for 2- to 3-year-old children in day care). Children in day care were more likely than children in home care to have protracted respiratory symptoms. Of 2741 respiratory tract infections recorded for the 3-year period, 801 (29.2%) were complicated by otitis media. During the first 2 years of life, children in any type of day care were more likely than children in home care to have otitis media as a complication of upper respiratory tract infection. In year 3, the risk of otitis media was similar in all types of child care.",Virus_Diseases
"Use of brain biopsy for diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected herpes simplex encephalitis: a statistical model and its clinical implications. NIAID Collaborative Antiviral Study Group. Using the decision analysis technique and multivariate regression methods, a statistical model was established to define the utility of brain biopsy for diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). Two strategies were compared: strategy I, brain biopsy with acyclovir (ACV) treatment for 10 days in biopsy-positive patients, and strategy II, ACV therapy without brain biopsy. Strategy I resulted in a greater 6-month survival rate when the likelihood of patients having HSE was less than 70%. Based on the current estimated prevalence of HSE (for patients with suspected HSE) of 35%, strategy I showed a slight advantage of a 3.2% increase in 6-month survival rate. An individual patient's chance of a positive brain biopsy can be predicted using a mathematical equation based on several important clinical assessments. This equation in conjunction with the decision analysis is a useful guide for the clinical management of patients with regard to brain biopsy.",Virus_Diseases
"Decreased measles antibody response after measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in infants with colds  We examined the possibility that the common cold or afebrile upper respiratory tract infection might interfere with successful immunization in children who receive standard measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Infants 15 to 18 months of age presenting at our well-child clinics for routine examination and immunizations were divided into two groups. Those infants with a history and physical findings of upper respiratory tract infection were compared with healthy control group infants who did not have upper respiratory tract infections, and who did not have a history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms within the previous month. Both groups were studied for their serologic response to measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Prevaccination serum samples were obtained prior to vaccine administration and postvaccination serum samples were obtained 6 to 8 weeks later. Measles antibody was measured in these serum samples by an indirect fluorescein-tagged antibody test. Ten (21%) of 47 infants with colds failed to develop measles antibody, while only one (2%) of 51 well infants failed to develop antibody. We conclude that infants with colds have a significant seroconversion failure rate associated with measles vaccine administration and that this may be the cause of some primary measles vaccine failures.",Virus_Diseases

"Roseola infantum and other syndromes associated with acute HHV6 infection. Eight cases of acute human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV6) infection in infants were diagnosed serologically by the demonstration of IgM anti-HHV6 (8/8) and a significant change in total anti-HHV6 antibody titre (6/8). Four infants were sufficiently ill to require admission to hospital and further investigations: one with encephalitis and three with gross hepatosplenomegaly, two of whom had evidence of simultaneous infection with another herpes-virus. The remaining four infants had an illness compatible with roseola infantum, although this diagnosis had not been made clinically. Sera from two of those infants with rash had been sent for analysis to exclude rubella because the infants' mothers were pregnant. The other two had received antibiotics when febrile, and the subsequent appearance of the roseola rash had raised the possibility of antibiotic allergy. The data suggest that there are clinical syndromes in addition to roseola infantum associated with the presence of IgM anti-HHV6, in which serological screening for evidence of acute HHV6 infection may be useful.",Virus_Diseases
"Evaluating the safety and potential use of a weight-bearing exercise, Tai-Chi Chuan, for rheumatoid arthritis patients. The safety of a traditional Chinese exercise, Tai-Chi Chuan, on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was evaluated. RA patients, who received 1 h of Tai-Chi Chuan instruction once (n = 20) and twice (n = 15) a week for 10 consecutive wk in two separate studies, showed no deterioration in their clinical disease activities compared with the corresponding controls (n = 11 and 9, respectively). Testing parameters included joint tenderness, joint swelling, time to walk 50 feet, handgrip strength and a written functional assessment. No significant exacerbation of joint symptoms using this weight-bearing form of exercise was observed. Tai-Chi Chuan exercise appears to be safe for RA patients and may serve as an alternative for their exercise therapy and part of their rehabilitation program. Weight-bearing exercises have the potential advantages of stimulating bone growth and strengthening connective tissue, but this effect needs to be documented in long-term studies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evidence of serum-protein leakage across the blood-brain barrier in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) in 23 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were compared with control cases for the presence of serum protein by immunoperoxidase staining. A sensitive immunostaining kit in conjunction with rabbit antisera to human serum, albumin, immunoglobulins and complement component 3c was used to demonstrate specific immunoreactivity in paraffin-embedded sections. Most AIDS patients with CNS lesions had serum protein immunoreactivity in some neurons, glial cells (including astrocytes), gliomesenchymal cell nodules, vascular endothelial cells, inflammatory cells or microvascular walls. Cases with the most necrosis tended to have the least immunostaining. Immunoreactivity for IgG and fixed complement in anatomically intact or morphologically altered neural cells may indicate cellular lesions and potential cellular necrosis beyond the damage indicated by routine studies alone. Part of this immunoreactivity might represent a humoral autoimmune response.",Virus_Diseases
"Urticaria pigmentosa. Systemic evaluation and successful treatment with topical steroids. Nine patients with adult-onset urticaria pigmentosa were studied for the incidence of extracutaneous mast cell involvement and the efficacy of potent topical corticosteroid therapy for cutaneous lesions. Seven of the nine patients had increased mast cells in the marrow biopsy specimens, and five patients had focal aggregates of mast cells. The bone scan was abnormal in one patient. Liver-spleen scans revealed a shift of colloid uptake from liver to spleen in four patients. No abnormal gastrointestinal tract roentgenograms were obtained. Urinary histamine metabolites correlated with nodular bone marrow involvement, but not with other parameters. Results of the psychoneurologic testing revealed significant deviation from the norm with a verbal memory deficit in all nine patients and abnormalities on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory in four patients. All nine patients were treated with 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate ointment under occlusion over half of the body nightly for 6 weeks. Seven of nine patients treated responded with almost complete resolution of their lesions. Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis suppression was evaluated with intramuscular cosyntropin stimulation and metyrapone administration during treatment. Only two patients, both of whom used the medication improperly, developed transient abnormalities. Slow return of lesions was noted 6 months after completion of therapy. Remissions could be lengthened with single weekly applications of topical steroids. Systemic involvement is frequent in patients with cutaneous mast cell disease and it is best demonstrated by bone marrow biopsy.

"Long-term human immunodeficiency virus infection in asymptomatic homosexual and bisexual men with normal CD4+ lymphocyte counts: immunologic and virologic characteristics. From a prospective cohort study, 24 asymptomatic men were identified who had been antibody positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for at least 5 years (median = 9.1) with CD4+ lymphocyte counts greater than or equal to 400 cells/mm3. Of these ""nonprogressors"", 23 (96%) had evidence of HIV infection by either HIV culture or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV DNA, although only 1 (4%) had a positive assay for HIV RNA (by PCR) and no one was positive for p24 antigen. Compared with 24 antibody-negative men and 14 men with AIDS, nonprogressors had higher CD8+ counts and lower natural killer cell activity. Nonprogressors had higher beta 2-microglobulin levels than did seronegative controls, suggesting some degree of immune system activation. Compared with men with AIDS, nonprogressors seemed to have a stronger antibody response to six different HIV-related proteins but did not differ significantly in neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic activity.",Virus_Diseases

"Pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime in serum and suction blister fluid during continuous and intermittent infusions in healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime were investigated during intermittent (II) and continuous (CI) infusion in eight healthy male volunteers in a crossover fashion. The total daily dose was 75 mg/kg of body weight per 24 h in both regimens, given in three doses of 25 mg/kg/8 h (II) or 60 mg/kg/24 h with 15 mg/kg as a loading dose (CI). After the third dose (II) and during CI, serum and blister fluid samples were taken. Seven new blisters were raised for each timed sample by a suction blister technique. Blisters took 90 min to form. Samples were then taken from four blisters (A samples) and 1 h later were taken from the remaining three (B samples). The concentration of ceftazidime was determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography method. After II, the concentrations in serum immediately after infusion (t = 30 min) and 8 h after the start of the infusion were 137.9 (standard deviation [SD], 27.5) and 4.0 (SD, 0.7) micrograms/ml, respectively.

Dermatologists were the major source of referral. The sex ratio was 2.4 males to 1 female. Patch tests were conducted in 79% of cases. Wet work industries predominated in females; in males the causative industries were more varied. Apprentices were affected in a high proportion of hairdressers and food handlers. Atopics accounted for 75% of the apprentice hairdressers. Atopics also were more prevalent in females with OSD than males. 29% of all cases had suffered from OSD for over 2 years before diagnosis. 75% of patients with OSD were less than 40 years of age at onset of OSD. Irritant contact dermatitis predominated over allergic contact dermatitis in all age groups except those over 60 years of age. Nickel was the predominant occupational allergen in females, whereas chromate was the predominant occupational allergen in males. 46% had been in the causative occupation for over 2 years before developing irritant contact dermatitis.

"Different types of chronic hepatitis in alcoholic patients: does chronic hepatitis induced by alcohol exist? To verify the existence of chronic hepatitis induced by alcohol, the clinicopathological features of chronic hepatitis in heavy drinkers were studied using various viral markers. Histological features of chronic active hepatitis were seen in 27 heavy drinkers. These patients were divided into four groups. The AL group (seven cases) consisted of alcoholics who were negative for both hepatitis C antibody and HBsAg; the HB group (four cases) was positive for HBsAg; the HC1 group (seven cases) was positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus-RNA genome; and the HC2 group (nine cases) was positive both for hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus-RNA genome. Serum AST and ALT activity declined during 4 wk of abstinence in most patients in the AL group and in the HC1 group. The response of serum AST and ALT to abstinence was poor in most patients in the HB group and the HC2 group. Serum desialo-transferrin and alcohol liver membrane antibodies were detected more frequently in the sera of patients in the AL group and HC1 group. A trend toward increased frequency of centrilobular ballooning existed in the AL group, but this did not reach statistical significance. These results suggest that chronic active hepatitis in patients in the AL group, in whom markers of HBV and hepatitis C virus were absent, may be caused by alcohol. Patients in the HC1 group who had hepatitis C antibody but not hepatitis C virus-RNA may represent cases where both alcohol and hepatitis C virus are involved.",Virus_Diseases

"The action spectrum between 320 and 400 nm for clearance of psoriasis by psoralen photochemotherapy. We have compared the effectiveness of oral 8-methoxypsoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) using ultraviolet fluorescent lamps with peak emission at either 325, 352 or 370 nm in the treatment of 24 patients with psoriasis. The forearms of each patient were treated three times weekly with two of the three lamps. The erythemal sensitivity of each patient was tested before the first treatment to ensure that equally erythemal doses of radiation were given from each of the lamps. A side-to-side comparison was used to assess response to treatment at weekly intervals for the 6 weeks of the trial. The lamp with peak emission at 325 nm was shown to be significantly superior to either of the other lamps in terms of response assessed at weekly intervals, and time to clearance of psoriasis. An action spectrum, constructed from the median doses required for clearance of psoriasis using each of the lamps, showed that the effectiveness of the radiation decreased exponentially with increasing wavelength throughout the UVA waveband, such that radiation at 320 nm was an order of magnitude more effective than at 360 nm. This suggests that lamps with peak emission around 325 nm will be more effective than those conventionally used in PUVA units with a peak emission at 352 nm. Lamps with peak emission around 325 nm are also highly effective in the treatment of psoriasis with phototherapy alone. Thus a single treatment unit containing these lamps could be used either for PUVA or ultraviolet phototherapy of psoriasis, avoiding duplication or irradiation equipment.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Fingernail deformities secondary to ganglions of the distal interphalangeal joint (mucous cysts). Twenty-six nail deformities secondary to ganglions of the distal interphalangeal joint were retrospectively reviewed to assess the important aspects of their management. The patients' ages ranged from 41 to 79 years. The long and index fingers were most commonly involved. A depression or groove was present in 23 of 26 digits reviewed. Two had gross disruption of the nail. Fifty-eight percent of the cysts had spontaneously drained or had been drained by the patient or a physician preoperatively. Degenerative arthritic changes were seen in 87 percent of those with x-rays or a radiology report available. Most underwent surgical removal of the cyst and debridement of associated osteophytes of the distal interphalangeal joint. The cyst was located above the germinal matrix in all but two digits. Osteophytes were found in all 20 digits in which the joint was explored. No recurrences were seen in those available for postoperative follow-up (22 of 25). Normal nail growth was found in 14 of 22, although follow-up was short in one. All eight postoperative nail deformities were quite mild and of little concern to the patient.

"IgA pemphigus foliaceus with a clinical presentation of pemphigus herpetiformis. A patient with clinical features of herpetiform pemphigus of the foliaceus type had histologic findings consistent with pemphigus. Intercellular IgA deposits in a pattern like that of IgG in pemphigus were present. Circulating pemphigus-type IgA-class antibodies reacted first only with guinea pig and later in the disease also with monkey esophagus sections. IgG-class pemphigus antibodies were blocked by the IgA-class antibodies of this patient. In addition, the IgA-class pemphigus antibodies in this patient were blocked by the IgG-class pemphigus antibodies in tests on guinea pig and monkey esophagus. This indicates that the IgA-class antibodies in this patient were directed either to the same antigen as the IgG-class pemphigus foliaceus antibodies or to one that is close enough to it to give steric hindrance. The skin lesions responded poorly to systemic corticosteroid therapy. Dapsone therapy initially produced dramatic improvement, but the condition flared to the point that plasmapheresis, in addition to high doses of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, had to be used to control it.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Comprehensive dental care and general anesthetic management of hereditary epidermolysis bullosa. A review of fourteen cases. Dental management of persons with epidermolysis bullosa remains challenging because of the severe hard and soft tissue manifestations of these diseases.

Twenty-three of the cases were managed with oral tracheal intubation to accomplish full-mouth dental rehabilitation. Dental therapy consisted of preventive, restorative, and surgical procedures, with extractions and stainless steel crowns being the most common treatment modalities. There were no serious postoperative complications, and no airway problems were experienced. Although extensive intraoral mucosal blistering did occur in several cases, postoperative healing progressed normally. Soft tissue trauma may be lessened through the use of small suction tips, flat tissue retractors, and extensive lubrication of all tissues requiring manipulation. This study provides further evidence that even the most severely affected patients with epidermolysis bullosa can receive comprehensive dental treatment directed at maintaining a functional dentition.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Therapeutic effects of cetirizine in delayed pressure urticaria: clinicopathologic findings. Cetirizine, a peripheral H1 antagonist, was administered to patients with delayed pressure urticaria in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Efficacy in reducing pressure-induced wheals and flares was evaluated. Histologic changes were also assessed with the skin window technique in weight-induced wheals. Results showed a statistically significant reduction in weight-induced wheal area (p less than 0.01) after cetirizine therapy; this improvement was accompanied by a concomitant reduction in eosinophil recruitment as demonstrated by the skin window technique (p = 0.0029). Subsequently, 14 patients with delayed pressure urticaria underwent biopsy before and after 3 weeks of cetirizine therapy to evaluate the drug's histologic effects. A blinded observer performed the histologic studies.

"Increased IL-6 production by monocytes and keratinocytes in patients with psoriasis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional inflammatory cytokine that is produced by monocytes and keratinocytes upon stimulation. Because psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by a hyperproliferative activity of keratinocytes and an inflammatory infiltrate, in the present study IL-6 production of monocytes and keratinocytes of patients with psoriasis was investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from psoriatics, atopics, and healthy controls were incubated for 24 h and, subsequently, supernatant IL-6 activity was measured using an IL-6-dependent hybridoma cell line (B9). Compared to controls and atopics, PBMC of psoriatics produced significantly increased amounts of biologically active IL-6. These findings were also confirmed by Western blot analysis using a specific antiserum directed against IL-6. Moreover, when the sera of the same patients were tested for IL-6 activity, sera of psoriatics contained significantly elevated amounts of circulating IL-6 in comparison to samples from atopics and healthy controls. In contrast to normal or uninvolved skin, keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions were remarkably positive for IL-6 as detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In addition, IL-6 also was found to induce its own synthesis and release by monocytes. These findings indicate that keratinocytes and monocytes in psoriasis are activated to produce increased amounts of IL-6, which may be one of the mediators involved in the regulation of both local and systemic inflammatory reactions occurring in skin diseases such as psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Antibody to hepatitis C virus and liver disease in volunteer blood donors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the specificity of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and their relation to liver disease in blood donors. DESIGN: Case series of consecutive blood donors found positive for anti-HCV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients were evaluated for antibody specificity using a recombinant immunoblotting assay (RIBA) and were evaluated for biochemical evidence of liver disease. Patients showing increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had a liver biopsy. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive blood donors found to be anti-HCV positive on both an initial and repeat ELISA. Inclusion criteria were as follows: an absence of hepatitis B surface antigens and non-organ-specific autoantibodies; a daily alcohol intake of less than 50 g; no history of recent hepatotoxic drug use; and normal serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, and copper. MAIN RESULTS: Anti-HCV positivity was confirmed by RIBA in only 13 of 50 donors (26%) who had positive ELISA results. These 13 donors had an elevated ALT level and histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis, which was active in 8 patients (62%) and had already produced cirrhosis in 2 patients (15%). In contrast, the 17 donors with an intermediate RIBA pattern had only mild and often nonspecific histologic liver abnormalities. The 20 patients with a negative RIBA result had normal ALT levels. CONCLUSION: In blood donors, the anti-HCV RIBA is not only more specific than the anti-HCV ELISA, but is also useful in identifying patients who have an underlying chronic liver disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Targeting gene expression to the epidermis of transgenic mice: potential applications to genetic skin disorders. The ability to specifically target gene expression to the epidermis of transgenic mice offers the exciting possibility of creating animal models of certain skin disorders that are inherited in man. It may be possible to produce mouse models of dominantly inherited keratinization disorders by targeting the expression of mutant genes encoding the major differentiation products of the epidermis, such as the differentiation specific keratins, filaggrin and cell envelope proteins. Mouse models for other skin disorders associated with abnormal regulation of growth, such as psoriasis, may be generated by targeting the overexpression of cytokines and growth factors, which are thought to play important roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. The development of currently unavailable animal models for certain inherited human skin diseases would not only contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases at the molecular level, but also provide interesting models for therapeutic intervention.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

We have determined the nucleotide sequence at the extreme 5' and 3' termini of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome. Our analyses of these sequences show (i) the nucleotide sequence in the 5' untranslated region is highly conserved among HCV isolates of widely varying geographical origin, (ii) within this region, there are blocks of nucleotide sequence homology with pestiviruses but not with other viruses, (iii) the relative position of short open reading frames present in the same region of the HCV genome is similar to that of the pestiviral genome, (iv) RNAs truncated at the 5' and 3' ends are found, but the origin and functions of these RNAs are unknown, and (v) poly(A) tails appear to be present on 3' subgenomic RNAs. These data differentiate HCV from the flaviviruses and indicate a closer evolutionary relationship of HCV with the pestiviruses. However, HCV also appears to be substantially different from other known pestiviruses. These data are consistent with the assignment of HCV to a separate viral genus.",Virus_Diseases

Levels of sIL-2R in serum of patients with active SLE were higher than in those with other common rheumatic diseases. Patients with active SLE and an increased percentage of CD4+ CDw29+ helper inducer (memory) and decreased percentage of CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor inducer (virgin) T cell subsets in blood demonstrated elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum. When compared with clinical manifestations of the disease, the sIL-2R levels in the sera of the patients with active SLE and thrombocytopenia were higher (mean 1710 units/ml) than those in active SLE with nephrotic syndrome (mean 1230 units/ml) or in active SLE with central nervous system disease (mean 1157 units/ml). However, patients with active SLE with humoral immunodeficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia) had highly elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum as compared to other patients with active SLE. The highly elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum may indicate that in vivo T cell activation plays an important role in this disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Cerebrospinal fluid and serum neopterin and biopterin in D-retrovirus-infected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta): relationship to clinical and viral status. Increases in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neopterin concentrations accompany many inflammatory diseases, including infection with HIV-1 and may reflect activation of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase 1 by gamma-interferon and other cytokines. In the present study, macaques with clinical simian AIDS (SAIDS) infected with the immunosuppressive type-D retrovirus D/1/California had increased concentrations of CSF neopterin but not of biopterin beginning soon after seroconversion. Normal neopterin concentrations in the CSF were found in macaques with SAIDS-related complex as well as asymptomatic, viremic macaques. CSF biopterin, serum neopterin and serum biopterin concentrations of D/1/California-infected macaques were not different from the levels in control animals. The increase in CSF neopterin may reflect local inflammatory responses and paralleled previously documented changes in L-tryptophan metabolism in these macaques. However, the absence of macrophage infiltrates in the brain of the infected macaques suggests a non-macrophage source of both increased CSF neopterin and tryptophan metabolites in the SAIDS macaques.",Virus_Diseases

They must be prepared to assess risks of HIV infection in all patients, counsel patients with histories of high-risk behavior about the reasons to be tested for infection, and explain the meanings of both positive and negative test results. The initial medical evaluation of an infected individual should include a history and physical examination to detect early manifestations of HIV infection, basic diagnostic tests, including CD4 counts and a purified protein derivative test, and immunization against potentially preventable infections.",Virus_Diseases
"Expression of basement membrane proteins and interstitial collagens in dermal papillae of human hair follicles. The expression of basement membrane molecules and interstitial collagens in human hair follicle mesenchyme was studied by immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections and of cells cultured from dermal papillae. Type I and type III collagens were found in the dermal sheath and in the dermal papilla throughout the hair cycle. Laminin and type IV collagen were expressed at the outer root sheath basement membrane and in the extracellular matrix of the dermal papilla of anagen and catagen follicles. In telogen follicles, where the volume of the dermal papilla extracellular matrix is much reduced, outline staining of dermal papilla cells for laminin and type IV collagen was still apparent. Staining for bullous pemphigoid antigen was also seen at the outer root sheath basement membrane extending to the lower tip of the hair bulb. In anagen follicles, there was no staining for bullous pemphigoid antigen at the interface between hair bulb epithelium and the dermal papilla and no staining within the dermal papilla. However, linear staining for bullous pemphigoid antigen became continuous around hair follicle epithelium during catagen and telogen. Cells cultured from human dermal papillae also stained for interstitial collagens, type IV collagen and laminin. However, similar results were obtained when cultured dermal fibroblasts were stained with the same antibodies. The expression of basement membrane proteins in human dermal papillae resembles that seen in follicles from other mammalian species and suggests that this is relevant to dermal papilla function. Cultured dermal papilla cells express a similar pattern of interstitial collagens and basement membrane proteins to those seen in tissue sections but this finding is not specific to dermal papilla cells.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Refractory parastomal ulcers: a multidisciplinary approach. Chronic parastomal ulcers in patients with ileostomy or colostomy stomas are unusual. Previous reports have implicated infections, fistulas, recurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pyoderma gangrenosum, and trauma. Over the past 8 years we have evaluated 10 cases of such refractory parastomal ulcers that occurred at a mean of 11 years after stomal surgery. Eight patients had had an ileostomy for IBD while two had undergone colostomy for colon cancer. Five patients with IBD were diagnosed as having pyoderma gangrenosum ulcerations. They required systemic treatment for a mean of 25 weeks to effect ulcer healing. The other five patients had either parastomal ulcers on the basis of dermatoses (contact dermatitis, eczema, or bullous pemphigoid) or contact ulcers due to face-plate pressure and parastomal dermatitis. These patients received topical treatment with healing of ulcers in a mean of 4 weeks. We conclude that parastomal ulcers occurring in patients without IBD or IBD patients without classic pyoderma gangrenosum require early dermatologic evaluation as they respond relatively quickly to appropriate local therapy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Characterization of a large deletion associated with a polymorphic block of repeated dinucleotides in the type III procollagen gene (COL3A1) of a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS IV) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by extreme fragility of skin, blood vessels, intestine, gravid uterus, and lungs. The phenotype is accounted for by mutations affecting the integrity and/or synthesis of the precursor procollagen molecules of type III collagen. In this article, we report the elucidation of the molecular defect in an EDS IV patient whose type III collagen was previously found to be structurally abnormal. We utilized PCR in a two-step process involving first the localization of the mutation in the mRNA and then the characterization of the defect in the gene. The results established the patient's heterozygosity for a genomic deletion of about 7.5 kb which eliminates 1,026 nucleotides of coding sequences in the message. The mutation arose as a result of an exon-to-intron recombination. The deleted segment extends from the 13th nucleotide of exon 9 to within a DNA sequence of intron 24, which is composed of a series of dinucleotide repeats. Using PCR, we tested the polymorphic nature of this DNA element on several unrelated individuals. Analysis of amplified genomic products of 45 chromosomes recognized at least four distinct allelic forms that display frequencies ranging from 5% to 61%. Mendelian segregation of three of the four alleles was established by the same method in a 3-generation family.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Prevention of HIV-2 and SIVsm infection by passive immunization in cynomolgus monkeys  Infection of macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) are useful models for studies of immunotherapy and vaccination against HIV as well as for testing of antiviral drugs. Vaccine research showing protective immunity in immunized monkeys has indicated that it will be possible to develop a vaccine for prevention of human HIV infection, although many hurdles remain. The design of an HIV vaccine would be helped if the basis of the protective immunity could be elucidated. Passive immune prophylaxis offers a means to determine the relative role of antibodies in protection against infection. We have studied whether a transfer of antibodies can prevent HIV-2 and SIVsm (SIV of sooty mangabey origin) infection in cynomolgus monkeys. Sera with high antibody titres were collected, heat-treated and injected into naive animals 6 h before challenge with 10-100 monkey-infectious doses of live homologous virus. All control animals treated with normal monkey serum (n = 6) or no serum (n = 39) became infected by the challenge virus, whereas five out of seven animals pretreated with antibody-containing serum at a dose of 9 ml kg-1 resisted infection. Thus passively transferred antibodies can protect against a low-dose lentivirus challenge in a nonhuman primate.",Virus_Diseases
"Air esophagogram and intestinal pseudoocclusion in a patient with scleroderma. Air in the esophagus is unusual because it is collapsible. Its finding on a chest roentgenogram, particularly when not associated with a fluid level indicative of stricture, should strongly suggest systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). We describe a patient with scleroderma with intestinal pseudoocclusion and an air esophagogram. Study of chest roentgenograms of 83 patients with scleroderma, including those of 7 with pseudoocclusion, revealed no other instance of air esophagogram. This radiological sign, although rare, should suggest scleroderma and may be particularly useful in patients with ""systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma."".",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Thy-1 and T-cell receptor antigen expression in mycosis fungoides and benign inflammatory dermatoses. We have studied human Thy-1 and T-cell receptor (TCR) antigen expression in mycosis fungoides and benign inflammatory dermatoses. The study included 24 biopsy specimens from 21 patients with mycosis fungoides (nine patch stage from eight patients, 13 plaque stage from 11 patients, and two tumor stage from two patients), six specimens from five patients with premycotic parapsoriasis (pre-mycosis fungoides), three specimens from three patients with lichen planus, 11 specimens from 11 patients with lupus erythematosus, 13 specimens from 13 patients with dermatitis, six specimens from six patients with drug eruptions, nine normal skin specimens from nine subjects, and three specimens from three patients with small plaque (benign) parapsoriasis. Immunoperoxidase studies using the avidin-biotin complex technique on serial frozen sections were performed. Primary antibodies were anti-human Thy-1, anti-alpha heterodimer of the TCR, anti-beta heterodimer of the TCR, and anti-delta heterodimer of the TCR. An extensive dendritic network of Thy-1+ cells was seen in all cases of mycosis fungoides. Epidermotropic cells were Thy-1 negative, and Thy-1 was expressed perivascularly in normal individuals and patients as previously reported. Epidermal gamma/delta cells were seen only in mycosis fungoides, where up to 60% of the epidermal lymphocytes expressed this TCR. The increased numbers of Thy-1 and gamma/delta T cells in mycosis fungoides were statistically significant when compared with normal skin or benign inflammatory dermatoses. The role of these dendritic dermal Thy-1+ cells and epidermal gamma/delta T cells in mycosis fungoides is unclear. The significant numbers of these potentially immunomodulating cells that were seen suggest that they are involved in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Forty-nine Japanese patients were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of alpha-interferon for chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis: 24 patients received 3 million units of recombinant human alpha alpha-interferon (alpha-2a) thrice weekly for eight weeks, and 25 patients received placebo in a similar schedule. The mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) dropped from 155 +/- 91 (SD) to 69 +/- 72 during interferon treatment, but remained unchanged (158 +/- 140 to 147 +/- 130) during placebo treatment (P less than 0.001). Serum ALT level fell to the normal range in 29% of interferon-treated patients, but in only 4% of placebo-treated patients. Pre- and posttreatment liver biopsies were obtained in all but one case. Average histological activity indices (HAI) were markedly improved in the interferon-treated group (9.5 +/- 3.7 to 7.0 +/- 4.3), but were unchanged in the placebo group (8.5 +/- 4.3 to 8.5 +/- 4.9). In addition, we compared the efficacy of interferon treatment between anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive and negative groups. Biochemical and histological improvements were similar and statistically significant in patients with and without antibody to hepatitis C virus. These data indicate that a eight-week course of alpha-interferon induces biochemical and histological improvement in more than half the patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis.",Virus_Diseases
"Trends and risk factors for HIV-1 seropositivity among outpatient children, Kinshasa, Zaire. To investigate recent trends in pediatric HIV-1 infection and the early impact of a blood screening program begun in one hospital in 1987 in Kinshasa, Zaire, we evaluated 1110 consecutive children seen in the pediatric emergency ward of the city's largest hospital in November 1988. The HIV-1 seroprevalence was 5.0%, not significantly higher than the rate of 3.8% found in 1986 (P = 0.2). The seropositivity rate was bimodally distributed; children less than 6 months of age had a higher rate (12.6%) than children 6-11 months old (1.9%; OR = 7.6; P less than 0.0001) and children 1-13 years old (4.1%; OR = 3.4; P less than 0.0001). Seropositive children greater than or equal to 1 year of age were more likely than seronegative children to be anemic and to have signs of malnutrition. A previous blood transfusion was associated with HIV-1 seropositivity among children greater than or equal to 1 year of age (OR = 5.4, P less than 0.0005), but not among younger children. Fifty-two per cent of seropositive children greater than or equal to 1 year of age received a transfusion (etiological fraction = 42%). The association with seropositivity was higher for those who had received a transfusion before 1987 than for those who had received a transfusion since 1987 (OR = 4.8, P = 0.01). These findings suggest a relatively stable, high pediatric HIV-1 seroprevalence in Kinshasa and a decreased but continued risk of transfusions. Expansion of currently limited blood transfusion screening programs, and the development of new strategies for limiting transfusions and preventing severe anemia, are needed.",Virus_Diseases
"Varicella-zoster virus-specific immunity after herpes zoster. The frequency of varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific T lymphocytes was higher in elderly subjects who had herpes zoster infections than in age-matched controls.

There were no differences in T cell or antibody responses to VZV between individuals with and without postherpetic neuralgia. Elderly subjects who had not had herpes zoster had a comparable increase in VZV-specific T responder cell frequency after immunization with Oka strain VZV. The data suggest that the potential for a boost in T cell response to VZV persists in the elderly, and that immunization can elicit a T cell response in this age group.",Virus_Diseases

The survey used 31,273 dried filter paper blood spot specimens obtained from newborns screened for hereditary disorders. Overall, 99 specimens were positive on two enzyme-linked immunoassays and on Western blot, providing a seroprevalence rate of 0.32 percent. The rate for child-bearing women residing within the City of Baltimore, 0.7 percent, was significantly higher than the rate for those residing elsewhere in Maryland, 0.1 percent.

"A prefecture-wide survey of mumps meningitis associated with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. A survey of untoward reactions, especially central nervous system reactions, after the administration of a newly introduced measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, was initiated soon after 4 patients were hospitalized for aseptic meningitis. Thirty-five, 6 and 2 children developed meningitis, convulsive disorders and parotitis, respectively, within 2 months after MMR vaccination during the 8-month period extending from April to November, 1989. The time lag between MMR vaccination and meningitis ranged from 14 to 28 days in the 35 cases of meningitis. Mumps virus, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid in 13 patients with aseptic meningitis, was characterized by determination of the nucleotide sequences of the P gene as mumps vaccine strain. The incidence of aseptic meningitis with positive mumps vaccine virus was estimated to be 0.11% (0.3% as a whole) during the 8 months from April to November and increased to 0.3% (0.7% as a whole) in September and October. We conclude that the incidence of aseptic meningitis after MMR vaccination seems to be higher than that reported previously.",Virus_Diseases
"Synovial membrane histology and immunopathology in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. In vivo effects of antirheumatic drugs. We examined the histologic and immunopathologic features of the synovial membrane of 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 12 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who had undergone total knee arthroplasty. Patients were classified into 5 groups according to therapeutic regimen and disease: RA treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), RA treated with NSAIDs and prednisone, RA treated with NSAIDs and methotrexate (MTX), OA treated with analgesics, and OA treated with NSAIDs. There were no significant between-group differences in the percentages or the distribution pattern of the infiltrating T cell subsets (CD4, CD8), HLA-DR, or interleukin-2 receptor-bearing cells. However, inflammatory indices, which included the thickness of the lining cell layer and the density of the mononuclear cell infiltrate, were significantly higher in the RA patients treated with prednisone and those treated with MTX (P less than 0.05). Similarly, fibrosis was markedly reduced in these 2 groups. The RA patients treated with NSAIDs alone and the 2 groups of patients with OA demonstrated similar profiles. These data suggest that prednisone and MTX may inhibit the development of fibrosis without altering the subsets of the inflammatory cell population. This observation raises the possibility that the action of these 2 drugs may be partly mediated by the suppression of inflammatory mediators that are responsible for fibroblast activation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Immunologic abnormalities accompanying acute and chronic viral infections. A number of viral infections induce profound alterations in immune function; these changes may or may not be related to direct infection of lymphoid cells. The immunologic abnormalities that occur during acute systemic viral infections such as measles or infectious mononucleosis include suppression of responses to tuberculin skin tests in vivo and suppression of mitogen responses in vitro, evidence of activation of the immune system with up-regulation of activation-associated cell-surface markers and soluble cellular products, and evidence of altered immune regulation with autoimmune disease and elevated IgE. These abnormalities are likely to be interrelated and can become chronic when the viral infection is not cleared and persists.",Virus_Diseases
"Local suppression of contact hypersensitivity in mice by a new bifunctional psoralen, 4,4',5'-trimethylazapsoralen, and UVA radiation. Although psoralens plus UVA radiation (320-400 nm) have been widely used for the treatment of dermatologic diseases, the toxic effects of these agents have led investigators to develop new photochemotherapeutic compounds. One such compound is 4,4',5'-trimethylazapsoralen (TMAP), a new bifunctional molecule. The purpose of this study was to examine the immunologic side effects of repeated treatment of C3H mice with TMAP plus UVA radiation. During this treatment, the number of ATPase+, la+, and Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells greatly decreased in the treated site, despite the lack of phototoxicity. The reduction in the number of detectable cutaneous immune cells was accompanied by a decrease in the induction of contact hypersensitivity to dinitrofluorobenzene applied to the treated skin, an impairment in the antigen-presenting activity of draining lymph node cells, and the presence of suppressor lymphoid cells in the spleen of unresponsive mice. Treatment with UVA radiation alone also reduced the number of ATPase+, Ia+, and Thy-1+ cells in the skin, but did not cause any detectable alterations in immune function. This implies that morphologic alterations in these cells do not necessarily indicate loss of function. Thus, although TMAP in combination with UVA radiation is not overtly phototoxic, it is highly immunosuppressive in mice.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Impact of cytomegalovirus infection on organ transplant recipients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the single most important infectious agent affecting recipients of organ transplants, with at least two-thirds of these patients having CMV infection 1-4 months after transplantation. Latently infected allografts are the major exogenous source of CMV infection in transplant recipients, although leukocyte-containing blood products can also transmit the virus. Three patterns of CMV infection are recognized: primary infection, reactivation infection, and superinfection. Primary infection has the greatest clinical impact. The clinical effects of CMV infection include infectious disease syndromes such as pneumonia and chorioretinitis; an immunosuppressed state that predisposes to potentially lethal opportunistic infection; and the initiation of a process that can result in allograft injury. Progress has been made in controlling CMV infection; hyperimmune anti-CMV globulin and certain antiviral drugs appear promising for prophylaxis, and the combination of hyperimmunoglobulin and ganciclovir appears promising for therapy.",Virus_Diseases
"Prevalence of HIV-1 p24 antigenemia in African and North American populations and correlation with clinical status. Sera from 622 individuals and culture supernatants from three HIV-1 viral isolates were assayed for HIV-1 p24 antigen to investigate the frequency of p24 antigenemia in African and North American populations using three commercial HIV-1 p24 antigen assays (Coulter, Du Pont, and Abbott). The prevalence of p24 antigenemia in 89 hospitalized Zairian AIDS patients was significantly lower than in 47 clinically comparable AIDS patients in the USA (17 versus 48%, P less than 0.0001). Prevalence of p24 antigenemia in sera from 200 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals was also lower in individuals from Zaire compared with 83 individuals in the USA (3.5 versus 7%). In African individuals, antigenemia prevalence increased with advanced clinical status: 8% in ambulatory AIDS patients, 17% in hospitalized AIDS patients and 18% in postmortem AIDS patients. Acid hydrolysis treatment of sera from 63 Zairian AIDS patients initially negative for p24 antigen showed an 11% positivity rate confirmed by neutralization, suggesting that immune complexing of p24 antigen may play a role in the observed lower p24 antigenemia rates reported for African individuals.",Virus_Diseases
"Increased dermal expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptors in growth-activated skin wounds and psoriasis. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogenic and chemotactic factor for fibroblasts and other cell types. PDGF effects are mediated by binding of PDGF to dimeric PDGF receptors possessing intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. We examined the expression pattern of PDGF receptors in cryostat sections of normal and growth-activated human skin using a monoclonal antibody, PR7212, specific for the beta subunit of the PDGF receptor. PDGF receptors were expressed at low levels in normal skin, with only occasional staining of dermal connective tissue cells. In contrast, PDGF receptor expression was greatly elevated in the dermis of growth-activated skin from 15 chronic wounds and 10 psoriatic lesions. PDGF receptors were increased in dermal fibroblasts and in dermal blood vessels in both conditions. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the increased expression of beta-subtype PDGF receptors in psoriatic lesional tissue. PDGF receptors were not detected in normal or growth-activated epidermis. Differential expression of PDGF receptors could regulate increased proliferation of vascular and connective tissue cells observed in psoriasis and chronic wounds.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Role for the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 in viral promoter switching during initial stages of infection. During latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of human B lymphocytes, six viral nuclear antigen (EBNAs) are expressed from long primary transcripts by means of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylylation sites. These transcripts initiate from one of two promoters, Cp or Wp, that function in a mutually exclusive fashion. Wp is exclusively utilized during the initial stages of infection of primary B lymphocytes, followed by a switch to Cp usage. These studies have been extended to show that (i) a mutant EBV strain lacking the gene encoding EBNA 2 fails to switch from Wp to Cp usage in primary B lymphocytes, although the virus contains a functional Cp; (ii) a region from -429 to -245 base pairs upstream of Cp is essential for Cp activity in B lymphocytes, but only in the context of upstream and downstream sequences; (iii) this region contains an EBNA 2-dependent enhancer; and (iv) DNase I protection employing nuclear extracts from B and T lymphocytes revealed a B-cell-specific footprint in the region of the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer. These results support a model for viral promoter switching during the initial stages of infection in which Wp activity leads to the expression of EBNA 2, followed by activation of Cp through the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer.",Virus_Diseases
"Catabolic effects of high-dose corticosteroids persist despite therapeutic benefit in rheumatoid arthritis. Although corticosteroids (CS) cause nitrogen wasting in healthy humans, it is not known whether the salutary antiinflammatory and appetite-stimulating effects of CS in inflammatory diseases mitigate this effect.

There was evidence of preexisting somatic protein and fat depletion in seven of nine subjects. Patients were allowed to eat freely on a metabolic ward. Nitrogen balances were -0.89 +/- 1.38 g/d (means +/- SEM) before CS therapy, -5.77 +/- 1.30 g/d during therapy (P less than 0.001), and -3.54 +/- 1.38 g/d after therapy (P less than 0.01) despite increased energy and nitrogen intake and clinical resolution of inflammation during and after the pulse therapy.

"Melanosis and associated tumors in transgenic mice. Melanosis was found to various extents in a wide array of tissues of all 23 autopsied mice whose transgene consisted of the tyrosinase promoter fused to the simian virus 40 early-region oncogenic sequences. Pigmentation in a given animal was attributable to any or all of the following; an increase in numbers of some normally pigmented cells of neural crest origin (a result compatible with early stages of transformation); elicitation of melanin synthesis in some cells that normally have little melanin, or none at all (the latter possibly signaling metaplasia); unusual intercellular transfer of pigment granules from melanocytes into certain normally unpigmented epithelia and endothelia; and profusion of melanin-phagocytizing cells. Neoplasms, occasionally also containing melanin, arose in association with some of these melanotic tissues and included three choroid plexus tumors, three endocardial tumors, two peripheral nerve sheath tumors (schwannomas), two cochlear tumors, two pineal gland tumors, one salivary gland tumor, and one nasal mucosa tumor.

There were significant differences in PAI values avo between PRP (and controls), SSRP, and SRP. PAI activity decreased significantly avo only in controls and in PRP, and there was significant t-PA antigen elevation avo in the same groups. In addition, since PAI is neutralized by activated protein C (PC), both PC antigen and PC activity were assessed avo and bvo. PC Ag remained unchanged in all groups, with PC activity significantly lower than controls in SRP and SSRP. Finally the authors looked for interference of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and lupus-like anticoagulant (LAC) with the PC system in collagen disease-associated RP. Specific IgG ACA were found in only 1 patient with SRP. In conclusion, there is an endothelial derangement, involving t-PA release and PAI, in SSRP and SRP patients. The reduced PC activity in these latter groups appears to be due to increased PAI influence rather than to ACA/LAC.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Course of HIV-I infection in a cohort of homosexual and bisexual men: an 11 year follow up study. OBJECTIVE--To characterise the natural history of sexually transmitted HIV-I infection in homosexual and bisexual men. DESIGN--Cohort study. SETTING--San Francisco municipal sexually transmitted disease clinic. PATIENTS--Cohort included 6705 homosexual and bisexual men originally recruited from 1978 to 1980 for studies of sexually transmitted hepatitis B. This analysis is of 489 cohort members who were either HIV-I seropositive on entry into the cohort (n = 312) or seroconverted during the study period and had less than or equal to 24 months between the dates of their last seronegative and first seropositive specimens (n = 177). A subset of 442 of these men was examined in 1988 or 1989 or had been reported to have developed AIDS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Development of clinical signs and symptoms of HIV-I infection, including AIDS, AIDS related complex, asymptomatic generalised lymphadenopathy, and no signs or symptoms of infection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Of the 422 men examined in 1988 or 1989 or reported as having AIDS, 341 had been infected from 1977 to 1980; 49% (167) of these men had died of AIDS, 10% (34) were alive with AIDS, 19% (65) had AIDS related complex, 3% (10) had asymptomatic generalised lymphadenopathy, and 19% (34) had no clinical signs or symptoms of HIV-I infection. Cumulative risk of AIDS by duration of HIV-I infection was analysed for all 489 men by the Kaplan-Meier method. Of these 489 men, 226 (46%) had been diagnosed as having AIDS. We estimated that 13% of cohort members will have developed AIDS within five years of seroconversion, 51% within 10 years, and 54% within 11.1 years. CONCLUSION--Our analysis confirming the importance of duration of infection to clinical state and the high risk of AIDS after infection underscores the importance of continuing efforts both to prevent transmission of HIV-I and to develop further treatments to slow or stall the progression of HIV-I infection to AIDS.",Virus_Diseases

All patients were men and ranged in age from 21 to 45 years. The HIV risk factors included homosexuality (6), intravenous drug abuse (2), and hemophilia A (1). All patients had high pathologically determined stage (one Stage III and seven Stage IV), and bone marrow involvement was observed in five patients with the initial diagnosis of HD based on marrow biopsy in two cases. Four cases were histologically subclassified as mixed cellularity (MC) and three as nodular sclerosis (NS); one patient underwent only bone marrow biopsy and was not subclassified. Histologically all cases were characterized by numerous Reed-Sternberg cells and variants, and with the exception of one case, all had a distinctive decrease in the proportion of reactive background lymphocytes compared with what is usually expected in MC or NS Hodgkin's disease (relative lymphocyte depletion). Flow-cytometric immunophenotypic studies done on cell suspensions from diagnostic lymph node biopsies in four cases showed decreased CD4:CD8 ratios (mean = 1.4) compared with expected values of 4 to 6. The relative lymphocyte depletion observed histologically is probably a reflection of the decreased tissue CD4:CD8 ratios, and this impairment of host immune response may be related to the observed high stage in all eight cases. Patients with high stage HD and the described histologic and immunologic features should be evaluated for the presence of HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Spontaneous and clastogen induced chromosomal breakage in scleroderma. Spontaneous and clastogen induced chromosomal damage was evaluated in lymphocytes of 10 patients with scleroderma and 21 controls. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with scleroderma not only had elevated rates of spontaneous chromosomal damage (p = 0.002), but also bleomycin induced (p = 0.041), streptonigrin induced (p = 0.035), and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide induced (p = 0.032) chromosomal breakage.

"The expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in experimental cutaneous inflammation: a comparison of ultraviolet B erythema and delayed hypersensitivity. Endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) are cytokine-regulated cell surface molecules involved in leukocyte adhesion. We have studied two forms of cutaneous inflammation to investigate in vivo the kinetics of adhesion molecule expression in relation to tissue accumulation of leukocytes. Immunohistology was performed on skin biopsies taken from human volunteers at 1, 6, 24, 72 h, and 1 week after two minimal erythema doses (MED) of ultraviolet B (UV-B) or intra-cutaneous tuberculin-purified protein derivative (PPD) (10-100 U). ELAM-1 expression on vascular endothelium and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration were first observed at 6 h and maximal at 24 h after both UV-B and PPD. At 72 h and 1 week, however, endothelial ELAM-1 was more strongly expressed in PPD biopsies. VCAM-1 was minimally expressed in control skin, and was induced above background levels on endothelium, on some perivascular cells, and on stellate-shaped cells in the upper dermis at 24 h after injection of PPD; it was maintained up to 1 week. In contrast, no induction of VCAM-1 was seen following challenge with either 2 or 8 MED UV-B. Following PPD, but not UV-B, there was marked induction of ICAM-1 expression on basal keratinocytes. In these biopsies, the inflammation induced in response to PPD therefore differed from UV-B-induced inflammation in showing prolonged expression of endothelial ELAM-1, induction of VCAM-1 on endothelium and other cells, and induction of keratinocyte ICAM-1. These differences may result from differences in the cytokines released and may in turn be responsible for the differences in the nature of the leukocytic infiltration during the two types of inflammatory response.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Experimental models for psoriasis. Evidence suggests that inherent in skin of psoriatic subjects are cells, architectural structures, and/or mediators, which are, at a minimum, responsible for its hyperproliferative epidermis. An objective of our laboratory has been to establish an in vitro definition of this inherent aberration. Fibroblasts are important to epidermal proliferation/differentiation. This, and an unconfirmed report that fibroblasts from psoriatic subjects might drive the abnormal epidermal proliferation in psoriasis, have caused further focus on the fibroblast. Data show that fibroblasts from patients with psoriasis, both involved and uninvolved, in the presence of human serum, either normal or psoriatic, have an increased rate of proliferation. Fibroblasts from uninvolved psoriatic sites are most responsive. To determine if fibroblasts from psoriatics could induce the psoriasiform phenotype on normal keratinocytes, an interactive skin equivalent system has been developed. With this system, fibroblasts from uninvolved and involved sites cause normal keratinocytes to have an enhanced outgrowth. Uninvolved fibroblasts cause the greatest changes. The nature of the skin equivalent system calls for this to occur via message over distance. We conclude that fibroblasts from psoriatic subjects can induce a psoriasiform phenotype via a soluble message.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Transbronchial biopsies in children after heart-lung transplantation. Sixty transbronchial biopsies have been performed in eight children after heart-lung transplantation. The selection of fiber-optic bronchoscope or a small (4 mm; 30 cm) rigid bronchoscope was made according to the size of endotracheal tube required at surgery. If the endotracheal tube was size 7.5 or greater, a fiber-optic bronchoscope was used, whereas if the endotracheal tube size was below 7, a rigid bronchoscope was used. For the diagnosis of lung rejection, the histology of biopsies revealed a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 69% (similar to the result in adults). The histology also distinguished lung infection from rejection. Complications included three pneumothoraces and two clinically significant episodes of hemorrhage, one of which led to a cardiorespiratory arrest, which may have been caused by hypoxia. As a result, arterial oxygen saturation is now monitored during the procedure using a pulse oximeter.",Virus_Diseases
"Association of HLA-Dw16 with rheumatoid arthritis in Yakima Indians. Further evidence for the ""shared epitope"" hypothesis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is prevalent in Yakima Indians, a Native American tribe. HLA-DR4, the HLA specificity commonly associated with RA in Caucasians, is rare among the Yakima. Using a specific oligonucleotide probe that recognizes DR4 nucleotide sequences associated with RA, a rare HLA-Dw16 gene was identified in 83% of Yakima patients with RA and in 60% of Yakima control subjects. This shared sequence encodes a discrete class II epitope that is highly correlated with RA in both DR4 positive and DR4 negative individuals.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The effects of cyclosporin A on eicosanoid excretion in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Alterations in renal eicosanoid levels have been postulated as a factor in cyclosporin A (CSA) nephrotoxicity. The effects of CSA on renal eicosanoid excretion in rheumatoid arthritis were studied over a 24-week period, during which treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was discontinued. The initial dosage of CSA was 4 mg/kg/day; at week 24, the mean dosage of CSA was 3.9 mg/kg/day. At week 24, the mean (+/- SD) serum creatinine level (1.04 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) was 32% above the baseline value; renal blood flow had decreased by 21% (P less than 0.03) and the glomerular filtration rate had decreased by 16%. There was a significant increase (P less than 0.03) in the 2,3-dinor thromboxane B2 level at week 2, but there was no significant change in the levels of the other eicosanoids. This study demonstrates that after CSA treatment, there is a selective increase in a thromboxane metabolite that parallels an increase in renal vascular resistance, even in the absence of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and with unimpaired formation of other vasodilator eicosanoids.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A laser-induced scar at the cardia increases the yield pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter  Low yield pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter is associated with esophageal reflux, and fundoplication must increase yield pressure if it is to prevent reflux. We attempted to increase yield pressure endoscopically in the dog by using the Nd:YAG laser to produce a fibrous scar at the cardia in the approximate line of the gastric sling fibers. Ten beagle dogs were studied. In a pilot study with two dogs, 15 watts for 4.2 sec were found to produce a scar deep into the muscle coat of the stomach. Three configurations of scar were used. One produced significant rises in yield pressure in all four of the dogs treated, the second produced a significant rise in one of the two dogs treated, and the third caused a significant drop in yield pressure in the one dog treated. One dog died of gastric perforation 10 days after lasering, but no other animal experienced any ill effects. These findings may have therapeutic implications for the management of esophageal reflux.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Ultrastructural heterogeneity of epithelioid cells in cutaneous organized granulomas of diverse etiology  In organized granulomatous inflammation, activated macrophages terminally differentiate into epithelioid cells (ECs). By light microscopy, individual ECs appear similar, irrespective of the inciting agent. Ultrastructural analysis of a number of clinical and experimental granulomas in man and mice reveals, however, three distinct varieties of these cells. They are classified as follows: (1) EC-I cells containing a mixture of lysosomal-dense bodies and phagolysosomes and arrays of rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm; (2) EC-II cells showing primarily a secretory mode with prominent Golgi bodies and rich arrangement of dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum with no phagocytic vacuoles; and (3) EC-III cells containing large multisized vesicles crowded throughout the cytoplasm and presently of unknown function. Although the unique appearance of these cells offers little diagnostic help, the cells do distribute differentially in different granulomas. The EC-I cells tend to predominate in infectious granulomas and where an excess of foreign material and debris is present. The EC-II cells are most characteristic of active sarcoidal granulomas, and the EC-III cells appear in chronic, long-standing granulomas. The heterogeneic nature of these cells seems to suggest their functions in granulomatous inflammation are not always the same.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

In four patients histopathologic examination showed findings of pemphigus vulgaris but direct immunofluorescence was positive in all patients. This study demonstrates that the immunopathologic disturbance in pemphigus vulgaris involves the entire length of the esophagus, although only some patients have clinical or histologic involvement.

"Skin responses to intradermal histamine and leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and in normal subjects. Mast cell inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, and newly formed compounds, such as the leukotrienes, cause wheal and flare when they are injected intradermally into normal subjects and may therefore play a role in the formation of urticaria. The effects of intradermal injections (50 microliters) of six different concentrations of histamine (range, 3.3 x 10(-4) to 3.3 x 10(-9) mol/L) and the leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 (range, 2 x 10(-4) to 2 x 10(-9) mol/L) have been compared in 10 normal subjects and in 10 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Wheal-and-flare sizes were measured at timed intervals up to 4 hours, and area under the curve for each response over time was calculated. There were no significant differences in leukotriene-induced responses between groups. Maximum sizes of histamine-induced wheal and flare were similar in each group of subjects. There were, however, significant increases in mean areas under the response curve of histamine wheal and flare in the patients with urticaria (wheal, p less than 0.001; flare, p less than 0.001; analysis of variance). These findings demonstrate a prolongation of skin responses to histamine in patients with urticaria and suggest an impaired clearance of histamine (or other vasoactive agents released by histamine) from the skin of these patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

These analyses highlight the significance of patterns of sexual behaviour, and in particular networks of sexual contact, on the predicted spread of infection. Current data reveal substantial variations in the degree of spread between and in countries, but new analyses support earlier predictions that in the worst-afflicted areas AIDS is likely to change population growth rates from positive to negative values in a few decades.",Virus_Diseases
"Comparison of cyclosporine and D-penicillamine for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Ninety-two patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were entered in a randomized double blind study of 24 weeks comparing cyclosporine (initial daily dose 5 mg/kg) with D-penicillamine (initial daily dose 250 mg). The groups were well balanced in baseline characteristics. In the cyclosporine group, 10 patients stopped prematurely, one because of inefficacy. In the D-penicillamine group, 9 patients stopped prematurely, 3 because of inefficacy. The 2 antirheumatic drugs were equally effective in reducing disease activity, except for a significant (p = 0.005) decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate with D-penicillamine treatment. We conclude that under the conditions of this trial, cyclosporine can serve as an alternative to D-penicillamine for the treatment of patients with RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Interleukin 1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma in psoriasis  Although recent studies have suggested that a variety of cytokines released by keratinocytes and inflammatory leukocytes could contribute to induction or persistence of the inflammatory processes in psoriasis, it remains unclear how production of these cytokines is regulated in psoriatic patients. To elucidate the biologic relevance of these cytokines to the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we investigated serum levels of interleukin 1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma in 21 patients with psoriasis vulgaris, together with 21 healthy controls. The mean serum levels of interleukin 1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha were not significantly different from those in controls, while those of interferon gamma were significantly elevated in the patients with psoriasis. Serum levels of interleukin 1 alpha correlated negatively with clinical disease severity expressed as psoriasis area and severity index score and with duration of psoriasis. In contrast, interferon gamma levels were related, although not significantly, to disease severity. In addition, an inverse correlation was noted between the interleukin 1 alpha levels and interferon gamma levels. These results indicate that interleukin 1 alpha and interferon gamma may be relevant to the induction and perpetuation, respectively, of the inflammatory responses in psoriasis, and that these cytokines, which have similar biologic properties, may strictly regulate one another's production in vivo.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Interferon system and natural killer cell activity in myasthenia gravis. The autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis is well characterized, but little is known about the mechanisms initiating it. We have studied the interferon system and natural killer cell activity in 25 patients with myasthenia gravis and compared them to 68 healthy subjects and 96 patients with acute viral infections. Forty-four per cent of patients had circulating interferon (greater than 16 mu/ml), and in a similar proportion their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were in an antiviral state, i.e., showed low levels of viral replication when infected by vesicular stomatitis virus. Spontaneous in vitro interferon production by patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also common (greater than 10 mu/ml, 32 per cent), while the response to the alpha-interferon inducer poly I:C was lower than expected, possibly reflecting the already high state of activation of the interferon system. These results were essentially similar to those obtained in patients with viral illnesses and differed significantly from healthy controls. In many myasthenia gravis patients (16 of 22, 73 per cent), a markedly deficient natural killer cell activity was found, with a median cytotoxicity of 6.5 per cent compared to 29 per cent in healthy subjects (p less than 0.005). Thus, many patients with myasthenia gravis have evidence of an activated interferon system and defective natural killer cell activity, suggesting an occult viral infection or reflecting nonspecific stimulation which may nevertheless contribute to the pathogenesis of the autoimmune response.",Virus_Diseases
"Serum erythropoietin titers in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and anemia. The pathophysiology of anemia in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is multifactorial. In order to determine the role of erythropoietin (EPO) response as a cause of the anemia, serum levels were determined by direct radioimmunoassay in 110 symptomatic patients with various stages of HIV infection. Symptomatic patients (ARC and AIDS) not receiving zidovudine (ZDV) therapy demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between serum EPO and hemoglobin levels (p = 0.01 and p less than 0.001, respectively). Patients with AIDS who were anemic while receiving ZDV demonstrated serum EPO levels that ranged from normal to markedly elevated (9-3,390 mU/ml). The diversity of serum EPO levels in patients with HIV infection and anemia suggests that the etiology of anemia in these patients and their potential response to recombinant human EPO may not be uniform.",Virus_Diseases

"Elemental diet for refractory atopic eczema. A total of 37 children with refractory wide-spread atopic eczema were treated with an antigen avoidance regimen comprising hospitalisation, exclusive feeding with an elemental formula for a median duration of 30 days, and measures to reduce exposure to pet and dust mite antigens at home. After the initial period of food exclusion, food challenges were performed at intervals of seven days, and the patients followed up for at least 12 months. Ten of the children (27%) either failed to respond to the regimen or relapsed within 12 months. Improvement in the eczema was seen in 27/37 (73%) patients, by discharge from hospital their disease severity score had fallen to a median of 27% of the pretreatment figure, and only 3/27 required topical corticosteroids. There were no clinical or laboratory findings which could be used to predict the outcome. Drawbacks to the regimen were prolonged hospitalisation (median 70 days), a fall in body weight and serum albumin concentration, and a risk of anaphylactic shock (4/37 cases).

Exposure to latex in the air elicited allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma. Systemic effects from latex occurred intraoperatively due to the surgeon's latex gloves. Anaphylactic shock included the above symptoms with the addition of tachycardia and hypotension. All patients had positive latex skin tests. Serum IgE antibody to latex was found with a latex radioallergosorbent test in all but one tested patient.

"Diminution of inducible lymphokine-activated killer cell activity in individuals with AIDS-related disorders. We have compared the relative ability of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells derived from peripheral blood of HIV-seropositive people, AIDS subjects, and healthy controls, to lyse a panel of natural killer (NK)-sensitive and NK-resistant tumor and virally-infected targets. We have found that LAK cells derived from HIV-seropositive populations show a significant, albeit reduced, capacity to lyse U937, K562, and RAJI target cell lines, in comparison with similarly derived cells from healthy controls. The reductions in LAK activity in both HIV-seropositive asymptomatic and AIDS populations reflect a significant reduction in cytotoxic potential of individual LAK cells. The maximal LAK cytotoxic potentials of control, asymptomatic seropositive, and AIDS populations are comparable. LAK cells derived from HIV-seropositive populations show an enhanced capacity to lyse HIV-infected U937 targets relative to their uninfected counterparts. These enhancements in HIV-infected U937 versus U937 cytolysis arise from increases in the maximal cell-mediated cytolytic plateau. Depletion of NK (CD56+) lymphocytes from peripheral blood prior to LAK cell generation markedly diminishes subsequent specific and total inducible LAK activity. In some subjects, peripheral blood T-cell depletion prior to LAK cell generation results in LAK cells that are subsequently enriched for cytolytic activity, whereas in other subjects similar T-cell depletion impairs inducible LAK cell responses.",Virus_Diseases
"Correlates of psychiatric distress among wives of hemophilic men with and without HIV infection. OBJECTIVE: The authors' objectives were 1) to examine symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger-hostility among the wives of men with hemophilia, a major risk group for AIDS, and 2) to identify psychosocial characteristics of the women and/or their husbands that were associated with elevated distress in the women. METHOD: Thirty-six women married to men with hemophilia were studied; the husbands of 17 of these women were HIV-seropositive. The men were drawn from the population of adults with hemophilia residing in a 24-county region of western Pennsylvania. Measures of wives' psychiatric symptoms were obtained, as were measures in three psychosocial domains: predispositional sociodemographic characteristics, psychosocial stressors, and husbands' strategies for coping. RESULTS: The psychiatric symptoms of the women did not differ as a function of their husbands' serostatus or across subgroups defined according to stages of HIV infection or clinical severity of hemophilia. Instead, other factors--perceptions of personal risk of AIDS, husbands' use of particular coping styles with respect to HIV infection, and the experience of other life events--were the principal correlates of psychiatric distress. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection acted primarily as an indirect source of stress for these women, mediated by other psychosocial characteristics of both the women and their HIV-seropositive husbands. Mental health interventions for caregivers of HIV-seropositive individuals should target the identified psychosocial correlates of psychiatric distress.",Virus_Diseases

"Screening for corticosteroid contact sensitivity. Comparison of tixocortol pivalate, hydrocortisone-17-butyrate and hydrocortisone. 3 corticosteroids have so far been tried as markers for corticosteroid contact sensitivity: hydrocortisone, tixocortol pivalate and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate. The present study compared these steroids for screening in addition to a standard patch test series. Of 727 patients, 28 (3.9%) reacted to tixocortol pivalate and 10 (1.4%) to hydrocortisone-17-butyrate; hydrocortisone gave an allergic reaction in 2 of 521 (0.4%) patients. Serial dilutions suggested that tixocortol pivalate, not marketed in Finland, caused allergic reactions which could possibly be cross-reactions to hydrocortisone. In contrast to previously published data, frequent cross-reactions occurred with hydrocortisone-17-butyrate and tixocortol pivalate. All allergic reactions to other corticosteroids found by testing with tixocortol pivalate concurred with reactions to hydrocortisone-17-butyrate. The study suggests that the most effective choice for routine testing for corticosteroid contact sensitivity would be both tixocortol pivalate and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The association of bullous pemphigoid and malignant disease: a case control study. In a case control study, the incidence of malignant disease in 84 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) was compared with 168 controls. The rate of malignant disease (past, concurrent or during follow-up) in BP patients was 17.9% compared to 5.3% in the controls. A number of the malignancies occurring in the BP group may be of doubtful significance, being either temporally very remote or partially attributable to treatment. The rate of concurrent BP and malignancy (within 8 weeks) was 6.0% suggesting that there is probably a slight excess of malignancy in BP, but insufficient to warrant extensive investigation in pursuit of cancer. Comparison of the BP patients with and without cancer identified no clinical or immunopathological subgroups in whom investigations would be indicated.

"Frequency and significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus in severe corticosteroid-treated autoimmune chronic active hepatitis  To determine the frequency and significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in severe autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, we tested sera from 85 cortico-steroid-treated patients by an enzyme immunoassay. Seropositive patients were assessed for specific antibodies to hepatitis C virus-encoded antigens by recombinant immunoblot assay. The findings in patients with and without anti-HCV were contrasted, and the frequency of seropositivity was compared with that in patients who had other types of chronic liver disease and in normal adults. Only 5 of the 85 patients with autoimmune hepatitis (6%) were seropositive for anti-HCV, and only 2 of these patients were reactive by recombinant immunoblot assay. The frequency of seropositivity in autoimmune hepatitis was not significantly different from that in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive (9%) and cryptogenic (18%) disease, but it was significantly less than that in posttransfusion chronic active hepatitis (6% versus 75%; P less than 0.001). Two patients became seronegative after corticosteroid therapy; both had been nonreactive by recombinant immunoblot assay. Four of the seropositive patients entered remission during corticosteroid therapy, including three whose sera were nonreactive to virus-encoded antigens. We conclude that anti-HCV occurs infrequently in corticosteroid-treated severe autoimmune hepatitis and that antibodies detected by enzyme immunoassay may be nonreactive to hepatitis C virus-encoded antigens. Seropositive patients who are nonreactive by immunoblot assay may still respond to corticosteroid therapy and become seronegative during treatment.",Virus_Diseases
"Sensitivity of digoxigenin and biotin labelled probes for detection of human papillomavirus by in situ hybridisation. The sensitivity of digoxigenin and biotin labelled DNA probes for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) by dot blotting and in situ hybridisation was compared in tissues from cervical, laryngeal, and anogenital neoplasia. Probes were either labelled with digoxigenin by the random primer technique and detected with anti-digoxigenin antibody, or labelled with biotin by nick translation and detected with streptavidin, both methods having a common final visualisation procedure using alkaline phosphatase. Digoxigenin labelled probes proved two to 10-fold more sensitive by quantitative dot blotting and four-fold more sensitive in detecting HPV 16 DNA in a series of 31 anal carcinomas, compared with biotinylated probes. The digoxigenin method also produced less non-specific background staining of tissue sections than biotin labelled probes. It is concluded that digoxigenin DNA labelling and detection provides a simple, reliable, and efficient alternative to the use of biotin or radioactive isotopes for the detection of HPV DNA by in situ hybridisation. Digoxigenin labelled probes also offer the possibility of double labelling in situ hybridisation procedures when used with biotin labelled probes to provide simultaneous identification of different DNA sequences.",Virus_Diseases

Daily survivorship, duration of the gonotrophic cycle, absolute abundance and season-long relative abundance were estimated for Aedes melanimon in the Sacramento Valley of California in 1987 and 1988 using mark-release-recapture (MRR) techniques and by monitoring changes in the abundance and parity rate of the native population. One objective of these studies was to determine the extent to which A. melanimon was biologically capable of serving as a horizontal arbovirus vector. Daily survivorship was estimated to be 0.90 and 0.84 in MRR studies conducted in September 1987 and August 1988, 0.89 based on changes in the parity state and abundance of the native population in August 1988 and 0.82 using summer-long parity data in 1988. Gonotrophic cycle length (GCL) was estimated to be five days in three studies. Aedes melanimon densities were estimated to be approximately 1,000,000 and 15,000 females per hectare in September 1987 and August 1988 respectively. Parous A. melanimon females were collected on each sampling occasion from April to November 1988, suggesting that A. melanimon maintained a continuous presence in the study area throughout the summer. The results of these studies suggest that A. melanimon has the potential to be an efficient horizontal vector of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), based on high adult survivorship, short GCL, high abundance and a continuous presence across the summer. This supports the concept of a WEE transmission cycle in the Sacramento Valley involving Ae. melanimon as an important vector. Aedes melanimon also can be an efficient horizontal vector of California encephalitis virus (CE), though the importance of horizontal transmission to the maintenance of CE virus is unclear.",Virus_Diseases
"Incisional slit grafting. Incisional slit grafting, a new and greatly improved technique in hair transplantation, is described. Incisional slit grafting utilizes larger numbers of smaller grafts than does traditional punch grafting. No tissue is removed from the recipient bed. The vascular supply is conserved, resulting in an increased graft yield. The clumping and stalking effect associated with traditional round grafting is eliminated largely, and a more natural frontal hairline is achieved.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"A double blind randomized parallel trial of intramuscular methotrexate and gold sodium thiomalate in early erosive rheumatoid arthritis. In a double blind study 57 patients with active erosive rheumatoid arthritis without malalignment or deformities (median disease duration 13 months) were randomly treated with 50 mg gold sodium thiomalate (GSTM) or 15 mg methotrexate (MTX) intramuscularly for 6 months. In the GSTM group, 5/28 patients had to be withdrawn because of side effects; in 2/28 the dose was reduced. In the MTX group, 2/29 were withdrawn, one was lost to followup. The number of swollen joints improved by over 6 in 18/26 (MTX) and in 15/21 (GSTM). Five clinical variables and the sedimentation rate improved significantly in both groups without significant intergroup differences. The radiographs of hands, wrists and forefeet (32 joints evaluated according to Larsen) showed a radiological progression in 11/26 (MTX) and in 8/20 patients (GSTM); however, the deterioration of the mean Larsen index was not significant. While there was no significant difference in effectivity, tolerability was better in the MTX group.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Impetigo herpetiformis associated with hypocalcemia of congenital rickets. A 30-year-old woman with congenital rickets and autosomal recessive ichthyosis developed impetigo herpetiformis in the second trimester of her first pregnancy. This condition was temporally related to her discontinuation of vitamin D supplements and subsequent hypocalcemia. No associated systemic symptoms were observed, and a healthy baby was delivered prematurely at 34 weeks' gestation. This report supports the association between hypocalcemia and impetigo herpetiformis and raises theoretical questions regarding a relationship between vitamin D metabolism and various epidermal hyperproliferative states.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Acyclovir resistance/susceptibility in herpes simplex virus type 2 sequential isolates from an AIDS patient. The biological characterization of a number of sequential herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) isolates obtained from an AIDS patient undergoing sequential courses of antiviral treatment due to an extended mucocutaneous genital lesion is reported. Resistance to acyclovir (ACV) and related compounds was linked to a thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) phenotype. After ACV discontinuation and a course of treatment with foscarnet, a new isolate was recovered, characterized by loss of the ACV-resistant trait and production of a functional TK enzyme. Data presented stress the need for monitoring chemosensitivity of HSV isolates in AIDS patients while suggesting that for better control of the infection, these patients should benefit from alternative treatments with drugs aimed at different viral targets.",Virus_Diseases

"Treatment type and amount influenced human immunodeficiency virus seroprevalence of patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Two hundred and eighty-two patients with congenital bleeding disorders received blood component replacement therapy between January 1979 and April 1985, were followed-up by the Puget Sound Blood Center's Hemophilia Care Program, and were tested for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Serologic results were obtained at least 1 year after the last exposure to volunteer donor products that were prepared before donor HIV screening or after the last exposure to concentrates produced before the manufacturer's use of treatment methods for inactivation of HIV. In all, 106 patients were anti-HIV positive. The risk of HIV infection was greater in patients with more severe bleeding tendencies, greater exposure to components, and exposure to lyophilized concentrates from large pools of donors. Of 100 patients with hemophilia A who only received cryoprecipitate from volunteer donors from Washington State (during the 6.3-year period), 14% had become anti-HIV positive. Of 27 patients receiving mostly cryoprecipitate but also being exposed to a single lot of concentrate during the same period, 13 (48%) were positive. Of 49 patients treated predominantly or solely with factor VIII concentrates during this period, 43 (88%) were anti-HIV positive. Of 29 patients with von Willebrand disease, four were anti-HIV positive, including 2 of 26 receiving only cryoprecipitate and two of three who had received a single dose of factor VIII concentrate. Of 19 patients who were treated solely with volunteer donor plasma, all remained anti-HIV negative. Of 47 patients exposed to factor IX concentrate, 28 (60%) were positive. Data relevant to the risk of HIV transmission subsequent to screening of the volunteer donor population were also obtained. Treatment records of 55 hemophilia A patients who have remained anti-HIV negative through at least June 1990 showed exposure to 71,173 screened donors from May 1985 through December 1989, and all 55 patients have remained anti-HIV negative.",Virus_Diseases
"Health status reports in the care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We examined the use of formal health status reports every 3 months over 1 year in the clinical care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The reports consisted of single-page, computer-generated summaries of scores derived from either the AIMS (Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales) or the MHAQ (Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire) health status questionnaires. A total of 1920 subjects from 27 community practice sites were randomly assigned to three study groups in each practice: intervention, attention placebo and control. Results showed that 55% of the physicians found the reports to be at least moderately useful as an aid to patient management, primarily for improving the doctor-patient relationship. However, no detectable differences among the three groups were seen in terms of medication compliance, number of physician visits, number of referrals, frequency of major medication changes, attitudes towards the physician, patient satisfaction or change in health status over 1 year. The failure to demonstrate objective benefits of health status reports in this study may be due to physician unfamiliarity with health status scores, failure to link the report with an office visit, the relative stability of clinical status in the subjects over 1 year and the relatively short time-frame of the study.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Soft tissue calcification in pediatric patients with end-stage renal disease. Soft tissue calcification is a recognized complication of uremia in adult patients and has been implicated as a cause of ischemic necrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory failure. However, soft tissue calcification has been regarded as rare in pediatric renal patients. Following a sudden death due to pulmonary calcinosis in an adolescent after renal transplantation, we retrospectively reviewed clinical, biochemical and autopsy data of 120 patients with uremia, on dialysis, or following renal transplantation cared for at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles from 1960 to 1983. Soft tissue calcification was found in 72 of 120 patients (60 percent). Forty-three patients (36 percent) had systemic calcinosis (Group A): the most frequent sites of mineral deposition were blood vessels, lung, kidney, myocardium, coronary artery, central nervous system, and gastric mucosa. Vascular calcification was uniformly accompanied by deposits in other organs. Twenty-nine patients had small amounts of focal calcification (Group B) and 48 patients had no soft tissue calcification (Group C). By multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of vitamin D or its analogues, the form of vitamin D medication prescribed, the peak calcium x phosphorus product, the age at onset of renal failure, and male sex were jointly associated with calcinosis (Group A). Vitamin D therapy showed the strongest independent association with calcinosis and the probability of calcinosis was greater in patients receiving calcitriol when compared with dihydrotachysterol and vitamin D2 or D3. The duration of renal failure, peak serum calcium, serum calcium at death, serum phosphorus at death, and primary renal diagnosis, were not statistically associated with calcinosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Idiopathic and glucocorticoid-induced spinal epidural lipomatosis. Pathological overgrowth of the epidural fat in the spine has been described and reported nearly exclusively in patients either with Cushing's syndrome or on chronic intake of glucocorticoids for a variety of clinical disorders. The authors report four patients with documented spinal lipomatosis (three pathologically and one radiologically). Only one of these patients received corticosteroids, and none had an underlying endocrinological abnormality. All four patients were adult males with a mean age at onset of symptoms of 43 years (range from 18 to 60 years). The symptoms ranged from simple neurogenic claudication and radicular pain to frank myelopathy. Myelography followed by computerized tomography were instrumental in the diagnosis of the first three patients; the fourth was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. The thoracic spine was involved in two cases and the lumbosacral area in the other two. The different treatment modalities were tailored according to the symptomatology of the patients. These included weight reduction of an overweight patient with minimal neurological findings in one case and decompressive laminectomy and fat debulking to achieve adequate cord decompression in the remaining three cases. Two patients improved significantly, the condition of one stabilized, and the fourth required a second decompression at other spinal levels. The various modalities of treatment and their potential complications are discussed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Olfactory identification deficits in HIV infection. OBJECTIVE: Impaired odor identification is described in a number of CNS disorders, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects the CNS in a large percentage of patients. To evaluate whether impaired olfaction may indicate CNS disease, the authors measured odor identification in patient groups defined along a continuum of progressive immunodeficiency and in a comparison group. METHOD: Most of the 42 HIV-infected patients in the study were outpatients in a clinic specializing in treatment of HIV-infected individuals. The comparison subjects were 37 healthy age- and sex-matched individuals who were recruited from hospital and medical school personnel. Ten of the patients were HIV-seropositive but had no symptoms, 24 had clinical evidence of immunocompromise, and eight had HIV dementia. All subjects were given the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, which presents common odorants and requires the subject to identify the odor from a four-item word list. The data were analyzed by using analysis of variance after arc-sine transformation and Scheffe post hoc analysis. RESULTS: All patients scored significantly lower on the Smell Identification Test than did the comparison subjects. The patients with HIV dementia had significantly lower scores than did the other two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically, impaired olfaction might serve as a marker of early CNS HIV involvement. Future studies should attempt to match comparison and experimental populations for socioeconomic status and HIV risk behavior.",Virus_Diseases
"Hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) frequently develop hepatic dysfunction. Although hepatic injury may indirectly result from malnutrition, hypotension, administered medications, sepsis, or other conditions, the hepatic injury is frequently due to opportunistic hepatic infection, directly related to AIDS. Infection with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare typically occurs in patients with advanced immunocompromise and with systemic symptoms due to widely disseminated infection. In contrast, hepatic tuberculosis often occurs with less advanced immunocompromise. Cytomegaloviral infection may produce a hepatitis. Cytomegaloviral and cryptosporidial infections have been implicated as causes of acalculous cholecystitis and of a secondary sclerosing cholangitis. About 10-20% of patients with AIDS have chronic hepatitis B infection. These patients tend to develop minimal hepatic inflammation and necrosis. The clinical findings in patients with hepatic cryptococcal infection are usually due to concomitant extrahepatic infection. Hepatic histoplasmosis usually develops as part of a widely disseminated infection with systemic symptoms. Hepatic involvement by Kaposi's sarcoma is rarely documented ante mortem because an unguided liver biopsy is an insensitive diagnostic procedure. Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver typically have lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and systemic symptoms. As a pragmatic approach, patients with liver dysfunction and HIV-related disease should have a sonographic or computerized tomographic examination of the liver. Patients with dilated bile ducts should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography because opportunistic infection may produce biliary obstruction. Patients with a focal hepatic lesion should be considered for a guided liver biopsy. Patients with a significantly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level should be considered for a percutaneous liver biopsy. When performed for these indications, liver biopsy will demonstrate a significant disease involving the liver in about 50% of patients with AIDS and in about 25% of patients who are HIV seropositive but who are not known to have AIDS. The clinical impact of a diagnostic biopsy is blunted by a lack of efficacious therapy for many opportunistic infections.",Virus_Diseases
Protein kinase C activity in normal and psoriatic cells: cultures of fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Protein kinase C (PKC) activity was measured in cultures of fibroblasts from biopsies of the involved and uninvolved skin of seven patients with psoriasis and from the skin biopsies of nine normal controls. PKC activity was significantly increased (P less than 0.005) in the particulate fraction of fibroblasts obtained from the involved areas of skin (450 +/- SEM 89 pmol/mg protein/3 min) and the uninvolved skin (394 +/- 94 pmol/mg protein/3 min) in psoriasis as compared to that of controls (103 +/- 24 pmol/mg protein/3 min). The soluble fraction of PKC activity was comparable in controls and in the fibroblasts obtained from involved areas and not significantly different from the values in fibroblasts from uninvolved skin. PKC activity was also measured in the soluble and particulate fractions of lymphocytes from 13 patients with psoriasis and from 14 normal controls. The PKC activity did not differ in the lymphocytes of patients with psoriasis from the controls in either the cytosolic or the membrane fractions. The increase in PKC activity as expressed at the membrane level of psoriatic fibroblasts may be related to an increase in sensitivity of these cells to hormones or growth factors involved in the regulation of their growth.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Low-dose chemotherapy with central nervous system prophylaxis and zidovudine maintenance in AIDS-related lymphoma. A prospective multi-institutional trial. OBJECTIVE.--To ascertain if low-dose multiagent chemotherapy, with central nervous system prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy, might be associated with increased efficacy and decreased risk of intercurrent infection in patients with malignant lymphoma related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN.--A phase II prospective clinical trial, with median follow-up of 33 months. SETTING.--Eight university hospitals, within the context of the AIDS Clinical Trials Units, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. PATIENTS.--Forty-two patients with AIDS-related malignant lymphoma. All were evaluable for toxicity assessment, and 35 for response. INTERVENTION.--A low-dose modification of the M-BACOD regimen (day 1): cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2 intravenously (IV); doxorubicin, 25 mg/m2 IV; vincristine sulfate, 1.4 mg/m2 IV; bleomycin, 4 mg/m2 IV; dexamethasone, 3 mg/m2 orally on days 1 through 5; methotrexate, 500 mg/m2 IV on day 15, with leucovorin rescue. Intrathecal cytosine arabinoside (50 mg) to all on days 1, 8, 21, and 28, with radiation therapy to a helmet field to those with central nervous system involvement. Zidovudine for 12 months after completion of four to six cycles of chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Response rate and number of opportunistic infections. RESULTS.--Response rate was 51% with a complete response of 46%. Of 16 complete responses, relapse occurred in four, none isolated to the central nervous system. Opportunistic infections occurred in 21% of those receiving treatment. Median duration of survival among all 42 patients is 5.6 months, 6.5 months in 35 patients evaluable for response, and 15 months in patients with complete response. Lower concentration of CD4 cells, history of prior AIDS, bone marrow involvement, and stage IV disease were independently associated with decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS.--Low-dose chemotherapy with central nervous system prophylaxis and zidovudine maintenance may be associated with durable remissions in AIDS-related lymphoma with fewer opportunistic infections than noted in prior reports.",Virus_Diseases
"HTLV-I-associated myelopathy associated with blood transfusion in the United States: epidemiologic and molecular evidence linking donor and recipient. Six months after receiving 58 units of blood components, a 65-year-old white man from New York City, with no other risk factors for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection, developed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Investigation of blood donors identified a 25-year-old white Hispanic woman from Florida whose platelets had been given to the patient and who was seropositive for the virus on a serum specimen obtained 2 years after the donation. She was born in Cuba and had had 2 sexual relationships with men who either had been born in or had resided in the Caribbean. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated that both donor and recipient were infected with HTLV-I. Molecular studies of a 595-nucleotide sequence in the 5' envelope region of HTLV-I indicated that the viruses from donor and recipient were identical in each of 32 positions in which published HTLV-I sequences demonstrate molecular heterogeneity; the donor and recipient viruses were also identical in 2 additional positions in which they differed from all published sequences. Transfusion-associated HAM/TSP has occurred in the United States, but additional cases should be prevented by screening blood donations for HTLV-I. Molecular studies of HTLV-I may prove useful in defining the genetic heterogeneity of HTLV-I isolates in the United States and in studying transmission of this virus.",Virus_Diseases

"Contact sensitivity (allergic contact dermatitis) to bis(tri-n-butyltin) oxide in mice. Contact sensitivity (allergic contact dermatitis) to bis(tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO) was demonstrated in the mouse. TBTO (in an acetone:olive olive oil vehicle) or acetone:olive oil alone (as a control) were applied to the shaved flank under an occlusive patch and animals were challenged on the dorsum of the ear 6 days later. Ear swelling was then measured using an engineer's micrometer, 2, 24, 48 or 72 h thereafter. Significant differences in ear swelling between control and TBTO-sensitized animals were found 24 h after challenge: thereafter the elicitation reaction declined rapidly whilst irritant swelling in control animals increased. Maximal elicitation of TBTO sensitivity could only be elicited by concentrations of TBTO that caused irritation. In a separate experiment, a single application of TBTO to the ears of naive animals provoked increase in auricular lymph node weight, cell yield and proliferation of lymph node cells during overnight culture. These data support the conclusion that TBTO is a contact sensitizer and illustrate the potential usefulness of the quantitative methods of contact sensitivity assessment which have been developed in the mouse.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Systemic interferon has been advocated as an effective therapy for recurrent genital warts. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial involving 172 patients with recurrent condylomata was conducted using systemic interferon alfa-2a in doses of 3 or 9 MIU three times per week for 4 weeks. The treatment period was followed by a treatment-free follow-up period of 2 months. Complete responders at month 3 were followed up to 9 months or until they had a recurrence, whichever occurred first. The combined rates of complete response (total disappearance of all lesions without appearance of new ones) and major incomplete response (at least a 75% reduction in total lesion area) at 3 months after the commencement of therapy were 34%, 25%, and 30%, respectively, in 166 patients receiving 3 and 9 MIU of interferon alfa-2a and placebo. The recurrence rates at the end of 9 months were 9% in the placebo and 3-MIU groups and 36% in the 9-MIU group.

Five young male patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha 2a (rIFN-alpha-2a) over a period of 2-2.5 years. An IFN dose of 18 x 10(6) IU was given subcutaneously every day during the first 3 months of treatment and then on alternate days. Additional treatment with radiotherapy and laser therapy was given and, in some cases, isolated skin nodules were excised. Within 7 months of initiation of therapy one patient had a complete remission of his tumours, however, tumour progression recurred after the patient discontinued treatment. In another patient the tumour cleared within 9 months of rIFN therapy, and after 52 months he is still free of KS.

"Recurrent herpes simplex keratitis with concurrent epithelial and stromal involvement. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations. A 65-year-old man with recurrent herpetic keratitis underwent corneal transplantation for persistent nonimmunologic graft failure. Histopathologic examination of the corneal button revealed an epithelial dendrite containing Cowdry type A inclusion bodies, moderate stromal edema, and a retrocorneal fibrous membrane. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated herpes simplex virus antigens in epithelial cells bordering the dendritic defect and in stromal keratocytes. The mean width of corneal epithelium displaying herpes simplex virus-positive epithelial cells on either side of the dendritic defect measured 200 +/- 46 microns. By electron microscopy, herpesvirus particles were identified in epithelial cells lining the dendrite as well as in stromal keratocytes. Infected keratocytes were scattered throughout the stroma but were not observed subjacent to the epithelial dendrite.

"Cytotoxic and immunologic effects of methotrexate in psoriasis. Based on recent experience that Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive drug, produces marked improvement in psoriasis, possible immunomodulatory activities of methotrexate (MTX) have been reviewed to look for alternate mechanisms of MTX action in psoriasis. It is generally considered that the therapeutic results of MTX in psoriasis are related to a direct effect on epidermal cell hyperplasia through inhibition of DNA synthesis. Several studies in the literature now suggest possible effects of MTX on the immune system of psoriatics as well as in animal models that may have some pathogenic similarities to psoriasis. In psoriatics receiving MTX, neutrophil chemotaxis is suppressed, resulting in a possible alteration in the potential pathologic activity of neutrophils commonly found in lesional skin. MTX does improve both psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis. Animal studies of the latter using adjuvant arthritis and graft vs host disease (GVHD) have indicated several possible mechanisms for MTX that affect these processes. In GVHD, MTX selectively destroys cycling CD8+ cells, and in adjuvant arthritis the activation of macrophages is prevented by inhibition of T-cell function. While MTX generally has not been clinically utilized as an immunomodulatory drug for immunologically related diseases, it may, nonetheless, have selective actions that could be specific for some diseases. MTX and Cyclosporin A could work mechanistically in similar ways but at different steps in the activation of T cells and macrophages. It may be that the major direct effect of MTX on epidermal cell proliferation is complemented or even mediated by subtle immunoregulatory effects on the melange of cells in the affected skin and the systemic immune response.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

In each group there were significant improvements in clinical score, CRP and ESR for all time points from 6 to 30 months; these improvements were maintained for longer (up to 60 months for SAS) in the SAS and gold groups but the differences between the drugs after 30 months were probably a consequence of falling number of patients, not differing drug potencies. The mean ESR and CRP levels fell to about 30 mm/h and 20-30 mg/l, respectively. Response was defined as (1) treatment duration greater than 6 months, (2) clinical score improvement greater than 4 by 6 months, (3) ESR fall to less than 30 mm/h by 6 months. By these criteria 142 of 681 patients (20.9%) responded; the response rates were SAS 20.3%, gold 24.1%, penicillamine 17.8%.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evaluation of screened blood donations for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection by culture and DNA amplification of pooled cells. BACKGROUND. Reports of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from transfusions of screened blood and reports of silent, antibody-negative HIV-1 infections in persons at high risk continue to foster concern about the safety of the blood supply. Previous estimates of the risk of HIV-1 range from 1 in 38,000 to 1 in 300,000 per unit of blood but are based on either epidemiologic models or the demonstration of seroconversion in recipients. METHODS. We isolated peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from blood that was fully screened and found to be seronegative, combined them into pools of cells from 50 donors, and tested them for HIV-1 by viral culture and the polymerase chain reaction, using protocols specifically adapted for this analysis. RESULTS. The 1530 pools of mononuclear cells were prepared from 76,500 blood donations made in San Francisco between November 1987 and December 1989. Of these pools, 1436 (representing 71,800 donations) were cultured successfully; 873 (43,650 donations) were evaluated by the polymerase chain reaction. Only one pool was confirmed as HIV-1--infected by both methods. After adjustment for sample-based estimates of the sensitivity of the detection systems using culture and the polymerase chain reaction, the probability that a screened donor will be positive for HIV-1 was estimated as 1 in 61,171 (95 percent upper confidence bound, 1 in 10,695). CONCLUSIONS. Silent HIV-1 infections are exceedingly rare among screened blood donors, so the current risk of HIV-1 transmission from blood transfusions, even in high-prevalence metropolitan areas, is extremely low.",Virus_Diseases
Epidermal growth factor/transforming growth factor alpha receptors and psoriasis. The abnormal growth and differentiation in psoriasis is reflected in the abnormal regulation of Epidermal Growth Factor/Transforming Growth Factor Alpha (EGF/TGF alpha) receptor metabolism. In psoriasis and other hyperproliferative skin conditions these receptors are persistently expressed throughout the interfollicular epidermis as long as the growth stimulatory signal persists. One of the first biochemical signs of effective therapy of psoriasis is the return of the EGF/TGF alpha receptor pattern toward the primarily basilar distribution seen in normal human adult skin. Whether the abnormal expression of TGF alpha in the involved skin induces the persistent expression of EGF receptors is not known nor is the signal that causes the increased production of TGF alpha. Studies to determine what factors regulate EGF receptor expression and TGF alpha induction may yield important new insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of psoriasis.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma. The surgical management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma remains controversial. Forty cases (41 ears) of labyrinthine fistulas were reviewed. This represented 10% of our total series of cholesteatomas in adults and children (426 ears). Clinical presentation, extent of disease, results of fistula testing and audiometric studies, and radiographic findings were analyzed. A canal wall-down procedure was performed in all but one patient. Generally an attempt was made to completely remove the cholesteatoma, to graft the fistulous area, and to reconstruct the middle ear mechanism in one stage. The matrix was preserved in patients with large fistulas where the involved ear was the only hearing one, when the matrix was adherent to the underlying optic duct, and in selected elderly persons. Long-term followup did not reveal a significant difference in hearing, degree of vertigo, or incidence of recidivism when those patients in whom the matrix was removed were compared with those in whom the matrix was preserved. The importance of recognizing the presence of a labyrinthine fistula preoperatively is stressed, along with the need to be prepared for an unexpected fistula.

A 68-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of fatigue, rhinorrhoea, pruritic skin lesions, left pleural effusion, ascites, oedema and weight loss of 10 kg. Investigations revealed hepatosplenomegaly, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, anaemia, leucocytosis with eosinophilia, hypoprothrombinaemia, hypocholesterolaemia and elevation of both gamma glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase. Biopsies of a skin lesion, bone marrow and liver revealed mast cell infiltration, allowing the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (SM). Hydroxyzine plus ranitidine were given without success.

Thirty women with ""atypical"" squamous cells but not cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) on their Papanicolaou smears were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) with the Southern blot hybridization technique. The Papanicolaou smears were reviewed for the presence of atypical squamous cells according to Patten's criteria. Comparison groups consisted of 30 patients with normal, 29 patients with CIN I and 24 patients with CIN II Papanicolaou smears. Ten of the 30 women (33%) with atypical cells on Papanicolaou smears were positive for HPV DNA as compared to 17% with normal and 59% with CIN I or II Papanicolaou smears. HPV 16 was present in 70-80% of the HPV DNA-positive patients in each Papanicolaou smear group. Concurrent CIN was also identified on colposcopically directed biopsies in 27% of the patients with squamous atypia. Patients with atypical squamous cells on Papanicolaou smears had coexisting HPV infection and CIN in about one-third of the cases.

"Acute lower respiratory tract infection due to virus among hospitalized children in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The nature of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in hospitalized children and of the associated viral agents was assessed in a study of 601 children less than 5 years old over a 24-month period. Of these children, 80% were less than 24 months of age and the ratio of boys to girls was 1.7:1. Pneumonia (86.5% of cases) was the most frequently observed clinical manifestation. Shedding of virus was detected in 21.1% of the children; the highest rate occurred in infants 0-5 months old (27%) as compared with a rate of only 12.5% in children 25-60 months old. Virus was detected in 33.3%, 32.8%, 21.2%, and 20% of the cases of tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup, respectively. Among the viruses detected, 78% were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (91% of infections with this virus occurred in children less than 2 years old) and 14.4% were influenza virus types A and B. Of the RSV infections, 61% occurred in infants less than 1 year old. The case-fatality rate was 6.8% overall and was 4.8% in virus-associated cases.

"Validation of Sickness Impact Profile and Psoriasis Disability Index in Psoriasis. A prospective cross-sectional questionnaire study of 32 patients with psoriasis was carried out in order to validate the use of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) in psoriasis and compare its sensitivity with the Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI). Overall PDI scores, but not overall SIP scores, correlated well with PASI scores (P less than 0.05). There was good correlation between the PDI and overall SIP scores (P less than 0.01). Psychosocial factors are more severely impaired than physical activities in patients with psoriasis. It is now possible to directly compare the disability experienced by psoriatic patients with that experienced by patients suffering from other systemic diseases, using the SIP.

"Lichen sclerosus and squamous hyperplasia of the vulva. A clinical study of medical treatment. One hundred thirty-eight cases of nonneoplastic epithelial disorders of the vulva treated with medical therapy from 1984 to 1988 were evaluated at the University of Florence, Florence, Italy. The 67 cases of lichen sclerosus were treated with testosterone propionate or progesterone ointment for 32 weeks. The 31 cases of squamous hyperplasia were treated with corticosteroid ointment for 16 weeks. The 40 patients with lichen sclerosus associated with squamous hyperplasia were treated with corticosteroid ointment for 12 weeks and then with testosterone propionate ointment for another 20. To evaluate the efficacy of the treatments, the patients were examined before and after therapy. The evaluation took into account the symptoms and gross appearance of the lesions, which were given a score of 1-3. Considering all the cases evaluated, a total regression of symptoms occurred in 82 patients (59.4%), while a partial regression occurred in 37 (26.8%). Furthermore, there was a total regression of gross changes in 68 cases (49.3%) and a partial one in 43 (31.1%).

"Marital status in rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic disorders: a study of 7,293 patients. Divorce has been considered to be increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), perhaps as a result of the stress of serious chronic illness. We studied marital status in 7,293 consecutive rheumatic disease patients attending an outpatient rheumatic disease clinic. Divorce was associated with age, sex, population size, and ethnic origin, but when these factors were controlled for, divorce was not more common in the 1,267 patients with RA. Age and sex adjusted divorce percentages for RA and non-RA patients were 6.9 and 6.8 compared with a U.S. percentage of 7.6.

"Urticaria and angioedema: diagnosis and evaluation. Because urticaria clears spontaneously in most patients, an extensive workup is not advised during the early weeks of an urticarial eruption. Whether and when to perform a screening workup or a more extensive workup depend on the degree of suspicion that the patient is ill, the urgency with which the patient presses for an answer, and the presence or absence of signs or symptoms that might lead the physician to pursue a diagnosis other than chronic idiopathic urticaria. Angioedema may occur with urticaria, and when it does, the prognosis is worse. Whereas urticaria manifests as circumscribed edema involving the superficial dermis, angioedema involves primarily the deep dermis or subcutaneous or deeper layers. Individual urticarial lesions usually disappear within 2 to 4 hours, whereas those of angioedema can persist for 72 hours. The workup for patients with chronic angioedema can be similar to that for patients with urticaria. However, several additional diagnostic possibilities should be pursued in patients with angioedema, such as hereditary angioedema caused by C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency, because anabolic steroids are effective in the treatment of these conditions.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Carbon dioxide laser energy disperses human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid onto treatment fields. The possibility of dispersing viral deoxyribonucleic acid during carbon dioxide laser treatment of human papillomavirus-containing genital infections has been investigated with a commercially available dot blot hybridization technique. The viral ribonucleic acid probes were specific for groups of human papillomavirus types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. Laser energy was delivered by continuous-wave mode and the plume of smoke was evacuated by a vacuum suction system. Samples were taken with Dacron swabs from lesional tissues of 43 patients as well as from the treated areas and from the 5 cm surrounding normal skin before and after laser vaporization. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was identified in swabs from 34 of 43 (79%) lesional tissues and 7 of 43 (16%) treatment fields. Although a trend for higher human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid positivity in laser margins after therapy (7/43, 16%) than before (4/43, 9%) was observed, the rates were not statistically significant. It is concluded that carbon dioxide laser energy disperses human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid onto treatment fields and the adjacent normal epithelium. Viral contamination of treated areas may be reduced by positioning the fume evacuator within 1 cm of the field of laser vaporization and cleaning the treated areas and surrounding tissue after therapy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Efficacy of SIV/deltaB670 glycoprotein-enriched and glycoprotein-depleted subunit vaccines in protecting against infection and disease in rhesus monkeys. Immunization with an inactivated whole-virus vaccine is highly effective in preventing lentivirus infection. The viral protein(s) essential to the induction of protective responses, however, have not been identified. To define the role of virion components in the induction of protective immunity, we evaluated the efficacy of glycoprotein-enriched and glycoprotein-depleted simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) subunit vaccines prepared by lentil-lectin affinity chromatography of gradient-purified virions using the immunization and challenge regimen previously found successful with an inactivated whole-virus vaccine. Infection was determined by successful recovery of virus, the induction of SIV-specific antibody responses, and infection of naive recipients by inoculation with lymph-node-derived lymphocytes from the vaccinates. Immunization with the glycoprotein-enriched preparation prevented infection in two out of four monkeys, whereas the glycoprotein-depleted vaccine failed to prevent infection in all four vaccinates tested. However, the glycoprotein-depleted vaccine appeared to moderate the progression of SIV-induced disease compared with non-immunized infected control monkeys inoculated with the same challenge dose. These data suggest that subunit vaccines containing sufficient quantities of viral glycoproteins can protect against SIV infection, whereas subunit vaccines composed predominantly of viral core proteins cannot. The development of effective vaccines against HIV infection should include studies on the optimum presentation of the viral envelope glycoproteins to produce long-term broadly protective immune responses.",Virus_Diseases
"Correlation of spontaneous suppressor cell activity with progression of human immunodeficiency virus infection. The immune system has been extensively evaluated in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The central role of the T-helper (CD4) cell in the immunopathogenesis of AIDS and the immunologic markers that can predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression have been described. However, the potential influence of suppressor cells in this disease process has not been clearly addressed. Spontaneous suppressor cell activity (SSCA) was evaluated in 78 patients with documented HIV infection at different clinical stages of disease progression. Higher levels of SSCA were found in patients with clinical AIDS less than 6 months and those dying of AIDS when compared with controls. Significant elevations (p less than 0.05) of SSCA were seen in patients newly diagnosed with AIDS, and those having AIDS greater than 6 months and less than one year. Patients surviving AIDS for greater than one year had depressed levels of SSCA compared to controls. Furthermore, SSCA appears to predict disease progression as patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) with elevations in SSCA progressed to AIDS while those with blunted SSCA did not progress. The level of SSCA in these patients was able to predict disease progression (p = 0.00016, Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.739). Patients with documented AIDS were also followed prospectively, and the level of SSCA was shown to be predictive of mortality (p = 0.009, Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.746). It is concluded that SSCA is a valid predictor of disease progression, and can serve as a prognostic indicator of disease outcome.",Virus_Diseases
"Characterization of a COL1A1 splicing defect in a case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII: further evidence of molecular homogeneity. A child affected by the type VII form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS VII) was shown to have a heterozygous structural defect in the amino-terminus of pro-alpha 1(I) collagen. As a result, type I procollagen trimers containing defective subunits are not converted to mature collagen molecules. To identify the cause of the protein abnormality, specifically primed cDNAs and genomic DNA were PCR amplified and sequenced. This analysis disclosed that the protein structural defect is caused by a single base substitution (A for G) at position -1 of the splice donor site of intron 6 of the pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene (COL1A1). The affected allele produces (a) transcripts lacking exon 6 sequences and (b), in lesser amount, normally spliced transcripts. Furthermore, the rate of exon 6 skipping is temperature dependent, for it appears to decrease substantially when the patient's fibroblasts are incubated at 31 degrees C. These findings are similar to those we previously reported for other unrelated EDS VII cases and, therefore, reemphasize the molecular homogeneity of this rare connective tissue disorder.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Transient porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. We report a case of acquired porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. Thrombosis of the portal vein and hepatic artery led to massive necrosis of the patient's first donor liver, necessitating its removal. After an 18-hour anhepatic period, a second donor liver was transplanted. During this interval, the patient was warmed with an infrared heat lamp that emitted bright visible light. Following the anhepatic period, a photodistributed cutaneous erythema was noted. The level of total serum porphyrins during the anhepatic period was significantly elevated at 1.548 mumol/L (normal, less than 0.018 mumol/L). Fractionation showed that the levels of the hydrophobic porphyrins, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin, were elevated, while the levels of the hydrophilic porphyrins remained normal. Following the successful second liver transplantation, the patient's porphyrin levels declined.

"Evaluation of enzyme immunoassays for antibody to human T-lymphotropic viruses type I/II. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of HTLV-I/II assays, serum from 1100 pregnant Haitian women was tested with seven commercially available HTLV I/II assays. Serum that was found to be reactive in any assay was analysed by western blot and all indeterminate samples were further characterised by radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPA). 59 (5.4%) samples were HTLV I/II antibody positive by western blot and/or RIPA. The sensitivity of these seven assays ranged from 93.2% to 100%. with the 'Recombinant HTLV-I' (Cambridge Bioscience) and 'Serodia HTLV-I' (Fujirebio) assays having the highest sensitivity (100%). The specificity of these assays ranged from 98.4% to 100%, with the Abbott assay having the highest specificity (99.5%, 100%) according to two different methods of evaluation. Whether the antigens used in any assay were whole disrupted virus or recombinant gene products made no difference. The low positive predictive values of some of these assays (71.8-91.7%), even in a high prevalence population, and the need for RIPA to test indeterminate sera, indicate that for routine screening of blood donors there is still room for improvement both in screening and confirmatory assays for HTLV-I/II.",Virus_Diseases
"Immunity during cyclosporine therapy. Cyclosporine is not cytotoxic but it inhibits the production of immunologic memory-building growth factors by CD4+ T lymphocytes. It also may have inhibitory effects on the effector phase of certain immune reactions. These inhibitory effects are largely reversible and when treatment is stopped, the immune competence of cyclosporine-treated patients returns to normal. In contrast, conventional cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents tend to exterminate the lymphocyte clones that are activated during therapy, and such clonal deletions may cause permanent loss of immunologic memory to those antigens because T lymphocytes are not readily restored in adults with involuted thymus. Most transplant patients have received cyclosporine in combination with various other immunosuppressive agents, and reports suggest that a combination of this drug and conventional immunosuppressive agents may be associated with increased early appearance of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and, possibly, endocrine-related tumors. An increase in cancers has not been observed in patients treated with cyclosporine alone for such conditions as psoriasis and autoimmune diseases. Treatment of adults with cytotoxic immunosuppressive drugs may permanently delete T-lymphocyte clones that are required for control of latent oncogenic viruses or certain malignant cells. Because of this, when such patients are treated with cyclosporine, further suppression of T-cell function combined with impairment of cytokine-mediated stimulation of natural killer cells and cytotoxic macrophages may facilitate tumor growth. Consequently, it is predicted that if cyclosporine monotherapy is associated with an increased incidence of tumors, it would primarily affect psoriasis patients who are treated with cyclosporine after PUVA or methotrexate therapy. Eventually, comparison of cancer incidence in different categories of patients should resolve this issue.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Combined therapy with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin decreases hematologic toxicity from zidovudine. Twenty-two patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or severe AIDS-related complex and multilineage hematopoietic defects were treated with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO) in a phase I/II trial. All patients were neutropenic and anemic after withdrawal of all bone marrow-suppressive drugs. Daily, G-CSF was subcutaneously self-administered until an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 6,000/microL was achieved and maintained for 2 weeks. Subcutaneous EPO was added to the regimen and the dose increased until an increase of 15 g/L of hemoglobin was observed. Groups of patients were administered increasing doses of zidovudine to determine their tolerance. G-CSF and EPO therapy was continued with dose modification to maintain an ANC greater than 1,500/microL and hemoglobin greater than 100 g/L. The dose of zidovudine was not altered. All 22 patients responded to G-CSF with a mean 10-fold increase in neutrophils occurring in less than 2 weeks. Significant increases in CD4 and CD8 cell number, lymphocyte proliferative response, and bone marrow cellularity were seen. EPO therapy increased hemoglobin in all 20 evaluable patients within 8 weeks. Sixteen patients received 1,000 mg and four patients received 1,500 mg of zidovudine per day. The reinstitution of zidovudine resulted in a decline in reticulocytes and hemoglobin and the reappearance of transfusion requirements in eight of the 20 patients, six of whom had the study medications stopped. No patient had the study medications stopped because of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Toxicities were mild and did not require dose modifications. Limiting dilution plasma and lymphocyte co-cultures for HIV as well as serum p24 antigen levels did not change significantly during G-CSF or combined G-CSF and EPO therapy. HIV p24 antigen decreased significantly with zidovudine therapy. Opportunistic infections occurred in 14 patients but were successfully treated with myelosuppressive antimicrobial agents, including ganciclovir, without the development of neutropenia. These results suggest that combined therapy with G-CSF and EPO may improve the neutropenia and anemia of AIDS. Combined therapy may allow the resumption of full-dose zidovudine in most patients intolerant of the hematologic effects of zidovudine without apparent alteration of HIV expression or the efficacy of zidovudine.",Virus_Diseases
"Localization of DNA sequences to a region within Xp11.21 between incontinentia pigmenti (IP1) X-chromosomal translocation breakpoints. Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked dominant disorder characterized by developmental anomalies of the tissues and organs derived from embryonic ectoderm and neuroectoderm. An IP locus, designated IP1, probably resides in Xp11.21, since five unrelated patients with nonfamilial IP have been identified who possess constitutional de novo reciprocal X;autosome translocations involving Xp11.21. We have used a series of somatic cell hybrids containing the rearranged chromosomes derived from three of the five IP1 patients, along with other hybrid cell lines, to map probes in the vicinity of the IP1 locus. Five anonymous DNA loci--DXS422, DXS14, DXS343, DXS429, and DXS370--have been mapped to a region within Xp11.21, between two IP1 X-chromosomal translocation breakpoints; the IP1 t(X;17) breakpoint is proximal (centromeric) to this region, and the IP1 t(X;13) and t(X;9) X-chromosomal breakpoints lie distal to it. While no IP1 translocation breakpoint has yet been identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (PFGE) analysis, an overlap between three probes--p58-1, 7PSH3.5, and cpX210--has been detected, placing these probes within 125 kb. Four probes--p58-1, 7PSH3.5, cpX210, and 30CE2.8--have been helpful in constructing a 1,250-kb PFGE map of the region between the breakpoints; these results suggest that the IP1 X-chromosomal translocation breakpoints are separated by at least this distance. The combined somatic cell hybrid and PFGE analyses we report here favor the probe order DXS323-(IP1 t(X;13), IP1, t(X;9]-(DXS422, DXS14, DXS343, DXS429, DXS370)-(IP1 t(X;17), DXZ1). These sequences provide a starting point for identifying overlapping genomic sequences that span the IP1 translocation breakpoints; the availability of IP1 translocation breakpoints should now assist the cloning of this locus.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Five cases of encephalitis during treatment of loiasis with diethylcarbamazine. Five cases of encephalitis following treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) were observed in Congolese patients with Loa loa filariasis. Two cases had a fatal outcome and one resulted in severe sequelae. The notable fact was that this complication occurred in three patients hospitalized before treatment began, with whom particularly strict therapeutic precautions were taken, i.e., initial dose less than 10 mg of DEC, very gradual dose increases, and associated anti-allergic treatment. This type of drug-induced complication may not be that uncommon in highly endemic regions. It occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in subjects presenting with a high microfilarial load. The relationship between the occurrence of encephalitis and the decrease in microfilaremia is evident. The pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in the light of these observations and the few other comments on this subject published in the literature.",Virus_Diseases
"Hidradenoma papilliferum of the upper eyelid arising from the apocrine gland of Moll. Hidradenoma papilliferum is derived from apocrine sweat glands and was originally described as a tumor located in the anogenital area. The authors recently examined a 78-year-old man with a hidradenoma papilliferum at the margin of the upper eyelid. While the tumor was located in the dermis, serial sections showed a connection to the epidermis and neoplastic cells partially replacing a gland of Moll. There were glandular structures with luminal cells that showed apical decapitation-type secretion, indicating the apocrine origin of the tumor. The luminal cells also contained granules that stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain and were diastase resistant. Results of examination of the duct-forming cells by transmission electron microscopy showed adluminal villi, focal decapitation secretion, luminal cytoplasmic debris, and electron-dense cytoplasmic secretory granules. Because the apocrine glands of Moll are localized adjacent to the eyelid cilia, hidradenoma papilliferum and other tumors of apocrine origin should be considered in the clinical setting of a mass at the eyelid margin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Marfanoid children. Etiologic heterogeneity and cardiac findings. The clinical, cardiac, and echocardiographic test results of 20 children with marfanoid features are reviewed. Fifteen were diagnosed as having Marfan syndrome, two had ""possible"" Marfan syndrome, and three had other diagnoses. On first evaluation, eight patients with Marfan syndrome (53%) had mitral regurgitation and none had aortic regurgitation. Echocardiography showed aortic root enlargement in 12 (80%) of 15 patients and mitral valve prolapse in 12 (80%) of 15. None had a normal echocardiogram. At follow-up examination, one patient had developed aortic root enlargement, and one patient, mitral valve prolapse. Thus, although aortic root enlargement is usually present in early childhood in patients with Marfan syndrome, it is not considered specific because in this study it also occurred in one child with Alport's syndrome and in one with marfanoid features.

"Central nervous system side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Aseptic meningitis, psychosis, and cognitive dysfunction. A review of the literature regarding central nervous system side effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) revealed three general categories: aseptic meningitis, psychosis, and cognitive dysfunction. Aseptic meningitis is found most commonly in patients with lupus treated with ibuprofen, but it should be considered in any patient with meningitis if the patient has used NSAIDs. Psychosis, although infrequently reported with NSAIDs, should be suspected in an elderly patient started on a regimen of indomethacin who acutely develops disorientation, paranoia, or hallucinations. Finally, there appears to be some potential for memory dysfunction and attention deficits in elderly patients treated with NSAIDs. Until further studies are available on the incidence and severity of these cognitive changes, physicians should use low doses of NSAIDs in the elderly and remain alert to the possibility of such adverse side effects.",Virus_Diseases
"High incidence of viral hepatitis among American missionaries in Africa. Protestant missionaries (n = 360) serving in sub-Saharan Africa between 1967-1984 were studied to determine the risk of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Personnel were serologically screened for antibody to both the hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and the surface antigen to the hepatitis B virus (anti-HBs) prior to departure, periodically during service abroad, and upon completion of their African tour. Rates of seroconversion were used as measures of the incidence of infection. Prior to service, 16% of the staff had anti-HAV and 3% had anti-HBs; post-service rates were 42% and 26%, respectively. Over 90% of the staff with greater than 20 years of service were seropositive for anti-HAV. For both viruses, the infection rate was highest during the first 1-2 years of service, when 28% of those susceptible to HAV and 11% of those susceptible to HBV became infected. Over the next decade, the median annual attack rate was 5.4% for HAV and 4.2% for HBV. Differences in the missionary HBV infection rate among the various African nations served tended to reflect differences in the magnitude of chronic HBV carriage among indigenous population groups. We conclude that missionaries to sub-Saharan Africa are at enhanced risk of both HAV and HBV infection, and that all should receive passive immunization with immune globulin and active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine.",Virus_Diseases
"Neutralization-resistant antigenic variants of caprine arthritis-encephalitis lentivirus associated with progressive arthritis. Fifteen newborn Saanen goats were orally infected with a biologically cloned isolate of caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV-63). At 33.5 months after infection, 8 of 12 seropositive goats had CAEV-63-specific neutralizing antibody. Five neutralization-positive goats developed clinically apparent arthritis of carpal joints, three of which had periarticular swelling indicating severe synovitis. Arthritis was not evident in age-matched controls or infected goats without neutralizing antibody. Multiple viral isolates were obtained from synovial fluid or synovial fluid cells of arthritic joints between 36.4 and 44.9 months after infection, and successive isolates from individual joints were defined as antigenic variants expressing type-specific neutralization epitopes. Thus, the evolution of neutralizing antibody does not arrest viral replication or development of progressive inflammatory lesions. Rather, some antigenic variants produced in the presence of neutralizing antibody are clonally expanded within carpal joints, and severe joint inflammation is specifically associated with these variants.",Virus_Diseases
"Cyclosporine and chronic sarcoidosis. Two patients with progressive sarcoidosis who had poor responses and side effects from corticosteroid therapy were treated with cyclosporine. Cyclosporine suppressed conventional markers of inflammation and there was clinical improvement in one patient, but the disease recurred when therapy was discontinued. The second patient who had diabetes mellitus developed unstable glucose metabolism when given cyclosporine. This unstable diabetes mellitus together with side effects of nausea and vomiting resulted in weight loss and inadequate serum therapeutic levels that was associated with a poor therapeutic response to the cyclosporine. The major side effects in both patients were headache and gastrointestinal symptoms, but there was no renal dysfunction. We conclude that while corticosteroids remain the mainstay of sarcoid therapy, when these drugs have not been successful for the skin manifestations of the disease, a trial of cyclosporine may be justified.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and postnatal viral labyrinthitis: a statistical comparison of temporal bone findings. Although the cause of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains uncertain, a viral origin has been suggested in many cases on the basis of anamnestic microbiologic and pathologic data. Twenty-two temporal bone specimens from 18 patients who during life suffered a sudden partial or complete sensorineural hearing loss were studied. On the basis of clinical data, these cases were assigned to one of three diagnostic categories, and the temporal bones were studied by light microscopy and serial section analysis. The implications of the histopathologic findings for the pathogenesis of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss are discussed.",Virus_Diseases
"Characterization of 230-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen associated with the detergent-insoluble fraction of cultured keratinocytes. The 230-kD protein identified by antibodies from patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) has a dual location in cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes: part in a high-speed supernatant of homogenized cells and part in a particulate fraction, where it is resistant to extraction by non-ionic detergent or mild base. Antibodies were affinity purified from the particulate 230-kD BP antigen, which can be extracted in the presence of urea. The affinity-purified antibodies bind not only the cytosolic 230-kD protein, showing that it is related, if not identical, to the particulate form, but also produce a discontinuous granular pattern by indirect immunofluorescence in the basement membrane zone of rabbit esophagus. In stratifying epidermal cultures, expression of the 230-kD BP antigen is limited to basal cells. These data are consistent with 230-kD BP antigen involvement in keratinocyte basal cell interaction with extracellular matrix and indicate that the cultured cell may provide a useful model for analysis of 230-kD BP antigen function.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Polypharmacy among patients attending an AIDS clinic: utilization of prescribed, unorthodox, and investigational treatments. The objective of this study was to describe the utilization and characteristics associated with the use of prescribed, over-the-counter, investigational, and unorthodox treatments among AIDS clinic patients. This report is derived from cross-sectional data obtained using structured telephone surveys. Study participants (n = 197) were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center AIDS clinic. One hundred eighty-nine participants (96%) received 1-24 prescription medications during the 3 months prior to interview. Those with an AIDS diagnosis received a relatively greater number of prescription drugs (p = 0.0001); an average of 5.6 prescribed medications were used by AIDS patients versus 4.8 among AIDS-related complex and 2.3 among asymptomatic patients. Thirty-one percent participated in drug trials during the 3 months before interview, including 18% who were in multiple studies. Twenty-nine percent used unorthodox treatments. Seventy-five (40%) received prescription medication from a provider other than their primary provider. A more advanced stage of illness was associated with the use of unorthodox treatments (p = 0.003): users of these treatments had a greater educational attainment than nonusers (p = 0.03) and were significantly less likely to report that their primary provider was aware of all the treatments they used (odds ratio = 2.1, p less than 0.03). We conclude that use of polypharmacy among some AIDS clinic patients is common, could create an increased risk for adverse drug reactions, and may affect clinical drug trials. Despite having decided to obtain care at a university-based clinic, many of the participants of this study also chose to receive unorthodox therapies and care from nonprimary medical providers.",Virus_Diseases

Treatment with chlorambucil and prednisone led to a dramatic reduction in her paraprotein level. In addition, cutaneous lesions improved and new lesions stopped appearing. Treatment of selected papules by cryotherapy or intralesional corticosteroid injection provided further improvement.

"Prevalence and sources of sensitization to emulsifiers: a clinical study. 737 patients with suspected cosmetic- or medicament-related contact dermatitis were patch tested with 6 emulsifier agents: triethanolamine, cetyl stearyl alcohol, sorbitan sesquioleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, and Amerchol L 101. 39 patients (5.3%) gave 1 or more positive patch tests to emulsifiers. A total of 54 positive reactions were found, 23 of which were clinically relevant, triethanolamine being the most frequent sensitizer. Patients with emulsifier sensitivity generally give a high prevalence of positive patch tests to other common ingredients of topical preparations, such as preservatives or active ingredients. Cosmetics and topical medicaments were detected as the source of sensitization in an equal number of patients. Patch tests with patients' own causative preparations were frequently negative. To avoid overlooking emulsifier sensitivity, it is advisable to test these compounds in patients with contact dermatitis that is possibly due to topical preparations, regardless of whether they have other clinically relevant positive reactions or whether patch tests with their own products are negative.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII: characterization of mutations and molecular heterogeneity. We identified two different exonic point mutations causing beta-glucuronidase (beta G1) deficiency in two Japanese patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPSVII). Enzyme assay of lysates of the lymphocytes and cultured fibroblasts showed little residual activity. The beta G1-specific mRNA levels were normal, as determined by northern blot analysis. Mutated cDNA clones, including the entire coding sequence, were isolated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products derived from beta G1-deficient fibroblasts. Sequence analysis of the full-length mutated cDNAs showed C----T transitions, which resulted in a single Ala619----Val change (case 1, a 24-year-old male) and a Arg382----Cys change (case 2, a 7-year-old female). The former change was revealed by a loss of the cleavage site for the Fnu4HI in the mutated cDNA. On the basis of the loss of Fnu4HI restriction site, the patient (case 1) was a homozygote with this mutation. The mutational change in patient 2 was confirmed by direct sequencing and by demonstrating heterozygosity for the mutation in her parents. The Ala619----Val and Arg382----Cys mutations each disrupt a different domain which is highly conserved among human, rat, and Escherichia coli beta G1s. Each of these two amino acid changes reduced the beta G1 activity of the corresponding mutant beta G1 expressed following transfection of COS cells with expression vectors harboring the mutated cDNAs.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Mechanisms include direct infection of glands by HIV or opportunistic organisms, infiltration by neoplasms, side effects of drugs, and production of humoral factors that may alter metabolism. The adrenal gland is most often affected, but virtually every endocrine system may be involved. Dysfunction is often subtle, with symptoms overlapping those of the HIV infection itself. Endocrine manifestations may be found at any time in the course of the disease, from the asymptomatic HIV-positive stage through full-blown AIDS. Optimal management of these patients may include a careful search for, and appropriate treatment of, associated endocrine abnormalities.",Virus_Diseases

"An anonymous seroprevalence survey of HIV infection among pregnant women in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory  We performed an anonymous seroprevalence survey of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection through HIV antibody testing of blood samples from 22,512 women aged 15 to 44 years receiving prenatal care in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory from Mar. 15 to Sept. 30, 1989. Of the samples six were confirmed to be HIV positive; this yielded a crude overall seroprevalence rate of 2.7 per 10,000 pregnant women (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 5.8). All of the positive samples were from women 20 to 29 years of age; four were from Vancouver, one was from Victoria, and one was from elsewhere. The highest seroprevalence rates were among women aged 15 to 29 years in Vancouver and Victoria (7.2 and 9.4 per 10,000 pregnant women respectively). Thus, 1 in 1300 pregnant women in that age group in the metropolitan areas of British Columbia was HIV positive. Application of seroprevalence rates to the total female population in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory revealed that as many as 401 women had HIV infection in 1989. Our estimates likely represent the minimum. As a subset of women of childbearing age pregnant women are likely at lowest risk of HIV infection, and so the true number of women 15 to 44 years of age with HIV infection is probably several times higher. Our study has provided a baseline assessment and will be repeated annually to analyse trends in HIV seroprevalence among pregnant women in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory.",Virus_Diseases
"Does fish oil protect renal function in cyclosporin-treated psoriasis patients? In order to study the influence of fish oil on CyA-induced renal dysfunction, 13 patients with psoriasis (CyA group) received cyclosporin A (CyA) alone, and seven patients (CyA/EPA + DHA group) received a combination of cyclosporin A and fish oil (6g eicosapentaenoic acid, C20:5 omega-3, and docosahexaenoic acid, C22:6 omega-3, daily) for 3 months. The glomerular filtration rate fell by 18.0 +/- 9.6% in the CyA group compared with 8.7 +/- 6.8% in the CyA/EPA + DHA group (mean +/- SD, P less than 0.05). The effective renal plasma flow fell by 10.6 +/- 8.9% in the CyA group and did not change in the CyA/EPA + DHA group (P less than 0.05). The calculated total renal vascular resistance increased by 19.8 +/- 14.5% in the CyA group and did not change in the CyA/EPA + DHA group (P less than 0.01).

"Diffusing capacity of the lung and nifedipine in systemic sclerosis. Lung involvement in systemic sclerosis may be due in part to a functional abnormality of the pulmonary vasculature. To investigate the possible role of a pulmonary vasospastic process in this disorder, 21 non-smoking patients who had no evidence of cardiac disease or pulmonary hypertension were evaluated with pulmonary function tests prior to administration of nifedipine, 30 minutes after a single oral dose of nifedipine (20 mg), and after 4 weeks of treatment with nifedipine (10 mg 3 times daily). Treatment with nifedipine did not significantly change any of the pulmonary function values, except for the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO). The linear trend between the individual DLCO values at baseline and their changes immediately following the initial 20-mg dose of nifedipine (r = -0.603, P = 0.02) and after 4 weeks of treatment (r = -0.636, P = 0.01) showed that the lower the DLCO value at baseline, the greater the improvement caused by nifedipine. These findings support the hypothesis of a potentially reversible pulmonary vasospasm in systemic sclerosis and suggest that nifedipine may be useful in the treatment of lung disease in these patients; however, further studies are needed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Relationship and prognostic value of endogenous interferon-alpha, beta 2-microglobulin, and neopterin serum levels in patients with Kaposi sarcoma and AIDS. We investigated whether elevated serum levels of beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin were related to the abnormal in vivo production of interferon described in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and whether these factors might add to measurements of CD4+ T cells in predicting survival and tumor regression in patients with Kaposi sarcoma associated with AIDS. beta 2-Microglobulin and neopterin levels were strongly correlated (r = 0.82), and were each significantly higher in patients with detectable serum interferon-alpha activity. Inverse correlations were observed between prognosis and levels of these serum products. Prediction by CD4+ T-cell count of tumor regression after treatment with interferon-alpha and zidovudine was improved by each of two factors: (a) the presence or absence of endogenous interferon-alpha activity, and (b) a combined variable reflecting relative levels of the interferon-inducible products, beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin. The level of beta 2-microglobulin was the single best predictor of survival. When beta 2-microglobulin was not considered, the endogenous interferon-alpha variable was the best predictor of survival, and the prediction was enhanced by addition of the combined variable, or the neopterin value alone. We conclude that serologic markers, which directly or indirectly reflect activation of the endogenous interferon system, may be valuable adjuncts to CD4+ T-cell counts in assessing prognosis and selecting and evaluating treatments for patients with Kaposi sarcoma and AIDS.",Virus_Diseases
"Comparison of linear antigenic sites in the envelope proteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 and type 1. The occurrence of dominant linear antigenic sites in the envelope glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) was evaluated. Twenty-five peptides representing different regions of HIV-2, strain SBL-6669, were synthesized. For comparison the corresponding peptides of HIV-1, strain BRU, were also prepared. The peptides were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with human sera from individuals with proven HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection and simian sera from animals infected with HIV-2 or simian immunodeficiency virus of sooty mangabay monkey origin (SIVsm). Four major antigenic regions were identified. Peptides representing parts or the whole V3 (neutralizing loop) region and an additional stretch of amino acids located at the carboxy terminal of this region showed considerable reactivity. This reaction was predominantly type specific, but some heterotypic reactivity was also seen. Peptides representing the carboxy terminal 21 amino acids of the V3 region of the type-related viruses HIV-2 and SIVsm allowed selective identification of strain-specific antibodies. A second major antigenic region was found close to the carboxy terminal end of the large glycoproteins. This region was cross-reactive between the two types. The two additional dominating antigenic regions were located in the amino terminal region of the transmembrane glycoprotein. One region has previously been shown to be a uniquely antigenic type-specific site. The other region was also type-specific, but was identified only in HIV-2, amino acids Glu634-Lys649. Excellent facilities are available for the design of not only type-unique site-specific serological tests but potentially also type-cross-reactive and strain-specific assays.",Virus_Diseases

"Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection in relation to asymptomatic maternal infection at the time of labor. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. To define the risk factors associated with neonatal acquisition of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, we prospectively obtained HSV cultures from the cervix and external genitalia of 15,923 pregnant women in early labor who were without symptoms or signs of genital HSV infection. Follow-up of the women with positive cultures for HSV and their HSV-exposed infants included serologic tests and serial cultures for HSV. RESULTS. HSV was isolated from 56 of the women (0.35 percent), 18 of whom (35 percent) had serologic evidence of a recently acquired, subclinical first episode of genital HSV infection, and 34 of whom (65 percent) had reactivation of HSV. Neonatal HSV developed in 6 of 18 infants (33 percent) born to the women with a first episode of genital HSV, and in 1 of 34 infants (3 percent) born to the women with reactivation of HSV (P less than 0.01); neonatal HSV also occurred in three of the infants born to the 15,867 women with negative cultures. Neonatal HSV-2 occurred in 1 of 4 infants born to mothers seronegative at delivery for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, in 4 of 12 infants exposed to HSV-2 whose mothers had only HSV-1 antibodies at delivery, and in none of the infants born to 31 women who were HSV-2-seropositive. An increased risk of neonatal HSV was associated with exposure to viral shedding from the cervix and the use of fetal-scalp electrodes. CONCLUSIONS: Of the asymptomatic women who shed HSV in early labor, about a third have recently acquired genital HSV, and their infants are 10 times more likely to have neonatal HSV than those of women with asymptomatic reactivation of HSV. The presence of maternal antibodies specific to HSV-2 but not HSV-1 appears to reduce the neonatal transmission of HSV-2. Further studies are necessary to determine whether screening and prophylactic treatment are warranted for infants of HSV-2-seronegative mothers who shed HSV-1 or HSV-2 in early labor.",Virus_Diseases
"Should cervical cytologic testing be augmented by cervicography or human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid detection? Criticism of the Papanicolaou smear in the lay press and recent federal legislation regulating cytology laboratories indicate a need to reappraise cervical cancer screening programs. This study directly compares three potential screening tests, used alone or in combination. A total of 1012 women aged 18 to 35 years were screened by cytologic testing, cervicography, and hybridization for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid, with discrepancies being referred by the last two authors. After findings from the entire lower genital tract were combined, 116 women (11.5%) showed definite clinical abnormalities (either exophytic vulvovaginal condylomas or cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions). Another 72 (7.2%) had positive Southern blot hybridizations without accompanying viral expression, yielding a cumulative frequency for established disease or latent infection of 18.6%. When associated vulvovaginal condylomas are disregarded, final groupings with regard to cervical pathologic classification were: 23 high-grade and 71 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 164 cases of equivocal atypia (34 of which had detectable human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid), and 754 cases with negative results (38 of which had detectable human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid). Cervical screening tests were compared principally by plotting increasingly liberal recall criteria onto receiver operating characteristic curves (i.e., graphs of true-positive results on the Y axis versus false-positive results on the X axis). Used individually, each screening test was valid, but none was substantially better than the others. No matter how liberal the recall criteria, no single test was able to detect all of the 23 definite precursors in this sample. Applying conventional recall criteria (i.e., high- or low-grade lesion suspected), cytologic testing alone detected 12 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (52.2%), at a cost of having to perform colposcopy in 8.7% of the sample. Combining all three tests and setting the end point as just a high-positive result by at least one test, 19 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (83%) were detected, with a recall of 7%. Optimal test performance (96% sensitivity, 4% recall) would have been attained by recalling all patients with high-grade cytologic results or positive cervicography results, plus any patients with low-grade morphologic atypia in which hybridization detected an oncogenic human papillomavirus type. Our conclusions are as follows: (1) Cytologic detection rates are markedly improved by a second or third test; (2) increased screening costs could be offset by not recalling patients with minor lesions with no apparent potential for progression.",Virus_Diseases
"Human papillomavirus DNA in anal carcinomas. Comparison of in situ and dot blot hybridization. Because the sensitivities of individual hybridization techniques differ considerably, their role in accounting for the published frequencies of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in anal squamous cell carcinomas, ranging from 0 to 61%, must be investigated. With the use of biotinylated probes to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33, three hybridization techniques were performed on the same paraffin-embedded tissue blocks selected from 13 cases of anal squamous cell carcinoma. HPV DNA was detected in 0%, 62%, and 85% of cases with the use of in situ hybridization with horseradish peroxidase, in situ hybridization with alkaline phosphatase, and dot blot hybridization, respectively. By dot blot hybridization, 69% had HPV 16/6 and 15% had HPV 6/11. An HPV DNA frequency range of 0-85% in the same group of tumors with the use of three hybridization techniques indicates the influential role of the method on HPV DNA prevalences. HPV DNA was identified regardless of patient gender or type of squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of HPV 16 in 82% of the positive cases in supportive evidence of the carcinogenic role of the HPV in anal squamous cell carcinoma.",Virus_Diseases
"The influence of renal function on diabetic foot ulceration. We examined the effect of renal function on the formation, severity, and outcome of diabetic foot lesions. Information was collected from a retrospective hospital chart survey and analyzed by univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis. Creatinine clearance, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease were all found to be independently associated with formation of foot lesions, indicating that each of these acts by distinct biologic mechanisms. Renal function had no bearing on the severity of lesions or on their eventual healing. We conclude that foot ulcers are more likely to develop in diabetic patients who also suffer from renal impairment, but they are no less likely to heal than are those in patients with normal renal function. We further conclude that attempts to preserve functional limbs in these patients are justified.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Simultaneous administration of two human-rhesus rotavirus reassortant strains of VP7 serotype 1 and 2 specificity to infants and young children. Two rotavirus vaccine strains representing VP7 serotypes 1 and 2 derived by reassortment between a rhesus rotavirus master strain, MMU18006, and either of two human rotavirus strains were administered simultaneously to infants and young children to assess potential interactions between strains. Children were observed in a day care setting for 10 days after vaccine administration for clinical symptoms, evidence of vaccine transmission, and patterns of viral shedding. Serum and local antibody responses were measured. The ratio of input virus strongly influenced the amount of each strain recovered from the child. Regardless of dose of virus administered, the neutralizing antibody response to the VP7 glycoprotein, the serotype determinant, was diminished in a bivalent preparation compared with a monovalent vaccine. Additional strategies must be sought to induce immunity against the multiple serotypes of human rotavirus before broad immunity will be established.",Virus_Diseases
"Non-A, non-B hepatitis specific antibodies directed at host-derived epitope: implication for an autoimmune process [published erratum appears in Lancet 1990 Jan 26;337(8735):252]  A cDNA clone (GOR47-1) bearing an epitope with an aminoacid sequence GRRGQKAKSNPNRPL (GOR epitope) was isolated from the plasma of a laboratory chimpanzee infected with human non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) agent. The epitope was not encoded by reported sequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) but instead was coded for by a host cellular sequence. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for antibodies to the GOR epitope (anti-GOR). A patient with acute NANBH produced both IgM and IgG classes of anti-GOR in the acute phase of the illness, with concentrations of IgG class anti-GOR rising when anti-HCV became detectable. Anti-GOR was detected in serum from 59 (81%) of 73 patients with chronic NANBH, 40 (65%) of 62 with NANB liver cirrhosis, and 25 (63%) of 40 NANB patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, but in only less than 10% of patients with chronic liver diseases due to hepatitis B virus, alcohol, or an autoimmune disorder, and in only 2% of voluntary blood donors. Circulating HCV-RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in most patients seropositive for anti-GOR but negative for anti-HCV. Detection of anti-GOR would therefore help in the diagnosis of NANBH and in reducing the occurrence of post-transfusion hepatitis.",Virus_Diseases
"Resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected asymptomatic men: HIV affects host metabolism in the early asymptomatic stage. To study the effect of persistent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on host metabolism, we performed indirect calorimetry in 11 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients (Centers for Disease Control group II or III) who were seropositive for greater than or equal to 1 y, but who still had normal numbers of circulating CD4+ T cells, and in 11 healthy control subjects of similar age and relative body composition. HIV-infected patients had 8% (P less than 0.05) higher rates of resting energy expenditure than did control subjects. Fat-oxidation rates were significantly higher in the patients (means +/- SE: 2.90 +/- 0.08 vs 2.19 +/- 0.17 g.kg FFM-1.d-1, patients vs control subjects, P less than 0.01) whereas no significant differences in carbohydrate-oxidation rates between patients and control subjects were found. These alterations in metabolism were not associated with increased concentrations of catecholamines, cortisol, or thyroid hormones. Mean concentrations of interleukin 6 in the patients were increased only twofold when compared with healthy control subjects. The results indicate that HIV infection affects host metabolism in the early asymptomatic stage, before CD4+ T cell numbers start to decline.",Virus_Diseases
"Survivorship analysis of the uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee replacement [published erratum appears in J Bone Joint Surg [Am] 1991 Sep;73(8):1274] Ninety-six patients who had a total of 108 replacements with an uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee prosthesis were followed for an average of sixty-four months (range, thirty-nine to ninety-three months). At the time of the most recent follow-up, twenty-one implants (19 per cent) had failed, all due to problems with the tibial component. A patellar component was not used, and no noteworthy patellar problems were encountered after the operation. There were no infections about the prostheses, and no femoral implant was revised. The most common cause of failure was collapse of the anteromedial part of the tibial plateau, which occurred in fourteen knees. The prosthesis loosened without collapse of bone in two knees, and five knees were revised because of gross wear of the polyethylene. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which revision of the prosthesis was recommended, the cumulative rate of survival was 84 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, +/- 7 per cent) at five years and 77 +/- 10 per cent at six years. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which the knee replacement was actually done, the five-year rate of survival was the same. No significant differences were demonstrated between groups that were stratified by age, sex, weight, or primary diagnosis. We therefore do not recommend the use of an uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee replacement of the design that was evaluated in this study.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"delta-Aminolevulinate dehydratase deficient porphyria: identification of the molecular lesions in a severely affected homozygote. delta-Aminolevulinate dehydratase deficient porphyria, a recently recognized inborn error of heme biosynthesis, results from the markedly deficient activity of the heme biosynthetic enzyme, delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-D). The four homozygotes described to date with this disorder have remarkably distinct phenotypes, ranging from a severely affected infant with failure to thrive to an essentially asymptomatic 68-year-old male. To investigate the molecular nature of the lesions causing the severe infantile-onset form, total RNA was isolated from cultured lymphoblasts of the affected homozygote, RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and the 990-bp ALA-D-coding region was amplified by the PCR. Heterozygosity for an RsaI RFLP within the ALA-dehydratase-coding region permitted identification of the paternal and maternal mutant alleles prior to sequencing. The maternal mutation (designated G133R), a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 397, predicted a glycine-to-arginine substitution at residue 133 at the carboxyl end of the highly conserved zinc-binding site in the enzyme subunit. The G133R mutation created a PstI site and permitted the confirmation and rapid detection of this lesion in amplified genomic DNA from maternal relatives. The paternal mutation, a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 823, predicted a valine-to-methionine substitution of residue 275 (designated V275M). This mutation was confirmed in genomic DNA from family members by the competitive PCR technique. Both missense mutations, which occurred at CpG dinucleotides, resulted in the synthesis of enzyme subunits such that the activity of the homooctameric enzyme was markedly reduced, thereby causing the severe infantile-onset phenotype in the affected homozygote.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Apparent response of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis to intrathecal interferon alpha. An 8-year-old boy with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) was treated with 1.0 to 3.0 x 10(6) IU human interferon alpha (IFN) by the intrathecal route weekly or fortnightly. Pronounced improvement of clinical and electroencephalographic findings were observed in a dose-dependent manner.

"Immunity to and frequency of reinfection with respiratory syncytial virus. To better understand the duration of immunity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the role of serum antibodies to the surface glycoproteins, F and G, in susceptibility to reinfection, 15 adults with previous natural RSV infection were challenged with RSV of the same strain group (A) at 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 26 months after natural infection. By 2 months about one-half and by 8 months two-thirds of the subjects became reinfected. Each challenge resulted in infection in at least one-fourth of the subjects. Within 26 months 73% had two or more and 47% had three or more infections. The duration of immunity tended to increase after two closely spaced infections. Higher neutralizing, F and GA antibody levels before challenge correlated significantly with protection against infection. However, even in subjects with the highest antibody levels, the risk of reinfection was 25%. Specific nasal IgA antibody titers did not correlate significantly with protection. This suggests that humoral neutralizing, F, and G antibodies correlate with resistance to reinfection, but protection is far from complete and is of short duration.",Virus_Diseases
"It is children with atopic dermatitis who develop asthma more frequently if the mother smokes. We elicited symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD) and of asthma from 620 children who were themselves nonsmokers, were aged 1 to 17 years, and had been consecutively referred to an allergy clinic. A histamine bronchial-challenge test revealed bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 95% of the children who had a history of wheezing or asthma and who could perform the test reliably, indicating that most of them did indeed have asthma. Children with a history of AD were much more likely to have asthma if the mother was a smoker than if she was a nonsmoker (79% versus 52%; p = 0.001). Similarly, if AD was found on examination, the percentages with asthma were 74% and 44%, respectively. By contrast, the children with no history of AD had asthma as frequently if the mother was a nonsmoker (42%) as when she was a smoker (40%). In children with AD, the prevalence of asthma was greater in both boys and girls when the mother was a smoker, but only in boys when the father was a smoker. Multiple logistic regression confirmed that the risk of asthma was greatly increased when the child had both AD and a mother who smoked.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Investigation of varicella-zoster virus infection by polymerase chain reaction in the immunocompetent host with acute varicella. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method developed to detect varicella zoster virus (VZV) in clinical samples is based on amplifying sequences of viral gene 31, the coding region for glycoprotein II. Its sensitivity was evaluated by amplification from plasmid VZV DNA containing VZV gene 31; 45 copies were detected in 1 microgram of human DNA. In testing within 24 h after the onset of varicella exanthem, 21 (75%) of 28 lesion samples were positive by VZV PCR, whereas VZV was isolated from only 21% by a standard tissue culture method. Only 1 (3.3%) of 30 samples of oropharyngeal secretions but peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 8 (67%) of 12 patients were positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the VZV PCR method indicates its usefulness for investigating the pathogenesis of VZV infection. Direct contact with cutaneous lesions rather than respiratory secretions may be the most important route of VZV transmission from healthy individuals with acute varicella.",Virus_Diseases

"Cicatricial pemphigoid. Identification of two distinct sets of epidermal antigens by IgA and IgG class circulating autoantibodies. A patient with severe cicatricial pemphigoid demonstrated both in vivo bound and circulating anti-basement membrane zone antibodies of the IgA and IgG classes. Complement component 3 (C3) was also deposited in the basement membrane zone of lesional skin as well as in normal-appearing buccal mucosa of the patient. However, C1q was absent, while granular deposits of two factors of the alternative complement activating pathway, properdin and properdin factor B, were present only in the basement membrane zone of lesional skin, but not in normal buccal mucosa. Deposition of alternative complement pathway reactants in the lesion suggests that complement activation by IgA was associated with lesion development. Western blot analysis of the patient's serum on electrophoresed cultured keratinocyte antigens identified two distinct sets of epidermal antigens. While IgG bound antigens of 230, 205, 140, and 90 kd, the patient's IgA antibodies bound a distinct set of antigens, 180 and 130 kd.

"Outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis in Oman: evidence for widespread transmission among fully vaccinated children. From January, 1988, to March, 1989, a widespread outbreak (118 cases) of poliomyelitis type 1 occurred in Oman. Incidence of paralytic disease was highest in children younger than 2 years (87/100,000) despite an immunisation programme that recently had raised coverage with 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) among 12-month-old children from 67% to 87%. We did a case-control study (70 case-patients, 692 age-matched controls) to estimate the clinical efficacy of OPV, assessed the immunogenicity of OPV and extent of poliovirus spread by serology, retrospectively evaluated the cold chain and vaccine potency, and sought the origin of the outbreak strain by genomic sequencing. 3 doses of OPV reduced the risk of paralysis by 91%; vaccine failures could not be explained by failures in the cold chain nor on suboptimum vaccine potency. Cases and controls had virtually identical type 1 neutralising antibody profiles, suggesting that poliovirus type 1 circulation was widespread. Genomic sequencing indicated that the outbreak strain had been recently imported from South Asia and was distinguishable from isolates indigenous to the Middle East. Accumulation of enough children to sustain the outbreak seems to have been due to previous success of the immunisation programme in reducing spread of endemic strains, suboptimum efficacy of OPV, and delay in completing the primary immunisation series until 7 months of age. Additionally, the estimated attack rate of infection among children aged 9-23 months exceeded 25% in some regions, suggesting that a substantial proportion of fully vaccinated children had been involved in the chain of transmission.",Virus_Diseases
"Interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 in psoriasis. We report on the levels of expression of IL-1 and IL-6 in skin from psoriasis patients. Different approaches were pursued. Initially, the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 were measured in suction blister fluid from lesional and uninvolved skin from psoriasis patients, using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and bio-assay. Skin sections were also examined for the presence of IL-1 and IL-6 using IL-1 beta- and IL-6-specific antibodies. Finally, the expression of IL-1 and IL-6 mRNA was determined in cultured keratinocytes (KC) and fibroblasts from psoriasis skin. Suction blister fluid from lesional and uninvolved psoriasis skin and from skin of healthy individuals did not contain detectable levels (greater than 100 pg/ml) of IL-1 beta. Blister fluid from psoriasis lesions contained low but significant levels of IL-6, whereas the serum levels of IL-6 in these patients was undetectable. Using cryostat skin sections and an IL-1 beta-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) in an indirect immunoperoxidase technique, a diffuse staining in the entire epidermis was observed in sections of uninvolved skin from psoriasis patients. In cryostat sections of psoriasis lesions, a faint diffuse staining of the epidermis and a pronounced ""dot-like"" intracellular staining pattern was observed. On the other hand, the same IL-1 beta-specific MoAb showed, in a indirect immunofluorescence technique using unfixed epidermal cells, bright membrane staining in epidermal cell suspensions from psoriasis lesions. Slightly elevated levels of IL-1 beta and IL-1 alpha mRNA were observed in cultured KC from psoriasis lesions as compared to those in normal KC and in the HEp-2 cell line. Very low levels of IL-6 mRNA were expressed in KC from psoriasis lesions and healthy individuals. Fibroblasts from psoriasis lesions expressed extremely low levels of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, but high levels of IL-6 mRNA. The results point to a paradoxical situation in psoriatic skin: blister fluid from psoriasis lesions contains no IL-1 beta, whereas IL-1 beta is overexpressed on the plasma membrane and in the intracellular compartment of epidermal cells. This finding may help in explaining the observed absence of IL-1 in aqueous extracts of psoriatic scales. Because cultured KC from psoriasis lesions express minimal levels of IL-6 mRNA. dermal fibroblasts, probably together with the inflammatory infiltrate, may represent a major source of IL-6 in psoriasis lesions in vivo.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Reduced neutrophil LTB4 release in atopic dermatitis patients despite normal fatty acid composition. Propositions about an abnormal fatty acid metabolism in atopic dermatitis patients prompted us to compare the phospholipid fatty acid composition and LTB4 release of neutrophils from 15 atopic dermatitis patients, as well as the adipose tissue triglyceride fatty acid composition, to that of 15 healthy controls matched by age, gender, and smoking habits. We found no differences in the tissue fatty acid composition between the two groups. The release of leukotriene B4 from Ca-ionophore-stimulated neutrophils in patients was on the average only 42% (p less than 0.001) of that measured in the control group, despite the very similar arachidonic acid contents of these cells. Our study does not support the assumption of an abnormal fatty acid desaturation in atopic dermatitis patients. Rather, the capacity to release and/or convert arachidonic acid into leukotrienes in neutrophils appears to be affected by this disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Subclass distribution and size of human IgA rheumatoid factor at mucosal and nonmucosal sites. Elevated serum levels of IgA, IgA1, and IgA2 rheumatoid factors (RF) were demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 69%, 73%, and 36%, respectively, of 100 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whereas fewer than 5% of 100 healthy donor sera contained elevated levels of these RFs. In serum samples from 125 controls with 4 different chronic diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, bronchial asthma, and polyarteritis nodosa), levels of IgA-, IgA1-, and IgA2-RF were found to be increased in 7%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. Comparison of RF levels in samples of serum, synovial fluid (SF), and saliva from RA patients indicated local production of both IgA-RF subclasses in salivary glands and in synovial tissue. Significant positive correlations were found between levels of IgA-RF subclasses in SF and serum, but not in serum and saliva or in SF and saliva. Fractionation of serum, SF, and saliva from patients with RA (by high performance liquid chromatography under acidic conditions) demonstrated that both IgA subclasses with RF activity occur mainly in fractions that also contain IgM. The results of this study show that 1) IgA-RF in serum and SF is mainly of IgA1 subclass, 2) both IgA-RF subclasses are produced locally in salivary glands and in synovial tissue, 3) the production of both IgA-RF subclasses at mucosal and nonmucosal sites is independent from each other, and 4) both IgA-RF subclasses occur predominantly in polymeric form in serum, SF, and saliva in RA patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The safety and pharmacokinetics of GLQ223 in subjects with AIDS and AIDS-related complex: a phase I study  A phase I dose-escalation study was performed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous infusion of GLQ223 in subjects with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC). The active ingredient in GLQ223 is trichosanthin. Trichosanthin, imported from China, is the active drug in community-initiated treatment programs for patients with HIV infection. Eighteen subjects were enrolled, 10 with AIDS and eight with ARC. All subjects were monitored for tolerance and toxicity. Immunological and virological parameters were also followed. GLQ223 administration was not associated with notable toxicity with the exception of one subject who experienced a severe neurological adverse reaction. No consistent or sustained changes in CD4+ lymphocyte populations or HIV antigen levels were observed. Serum concentrations of GLQ223 that were comparable to concentrations shown to have antiviral activity in vitro were achieved transiently but may not have been maintained for a sufficient duration to exert antiretroviral effects.

"Melanocytic lesions and melanocyte populations in human epidermis. Basal melanocytes were counted and atypia assessed on an arbitrary scale in punch biopsies from the sun-exposed extensor aspect of the forearm of normal skin and from the covered skin of the buttock of patients with pigmented naevi and control subjects. The difference in melanocyte counts and in the presence of atypia between sun-exposed and covered skin was statistically highly significant. The only other difference was between melanocyte counts in covered skin from those with multiple atypical naevi and all other groups; the counts in the former were greater than those in the latter. No further difference was attributable to sun exposure, skin type or diagnostic group. Some degree of melanocyte atypia was seen in approximately half of the biopsies of sun-exposed skin, but atypia was seen in only six of 84 biopsies of covered skin. In each case atypia was present in the corresponding forearm biopsy and all six subjects had pigmented lesions (four with melanoma and two with multiple atypical naevi). It seems possible that while increased melanocyte counts in covered skin could correlate with the presence of atypical naevi, atypia of covered epidermal melanocytes could possibly relate to melanoma risk.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Human immunodeficiency virus infection of fibroblasts of dental pulp in seropositive patients. Presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) within noninflamed human dental pulps was documented by polymerase chain reaction assays in 11 of 12 pulps from HIV-seropositive patients. The purpose of the present study was to determine the cellular location of HIV in vivo within these tissues by means of in situ hybridization. Results of the in situ hybridization indicated HIV within fibroblasts of the pulp. These results are especially relevant because fibroblasts lack the CD4 receptor thought necessary for in vivo infection with HIV. These results suggest the fibroblast as a possible reservoir for HIV in the body.,Virus_Diseases

"Hunter disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type II) associated with unbalanced inactivation of the X chromosomes in a karyotypically normal girl. The mechanism of profound generalized iduronate sulfatase (IDS) deficiency in a developmentally delayed female with clinical Hunter syndrome was studied. Methylation-sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes from the patient, using MspI/HpaII digestion and probing with M27 beta, showed that the paternal allele was resistant to HpaII digestion (i.e., was methylated) while the maternal allele was digested (i.e., was hypomethylated), indicating marked imbalance of X-chromosome inactivation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patient. Similar studies on DNA from maternal lymphocytes showed random X-chromosome inactivation. Among a total of 40 independent maternal fibroblast clones isolated by dilution plating and analyzed for IDS activity, no IDS- clone was found. Somatic cell hybrid clones containing at least one active human X chromosome were produced by fusion of patient fibroblasts with Hprt- hamster fibroblasts (RJK88) and grown in HAT-ouabain medium. Methylation-sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from the hybrids showed that of the 22 clones that retained the DXS255 locus (M27 beta), all contained the paternal allele in the methylated (active) form. No clone was isolated containing only the maternal X chromosome, and in no case was the maternal allele hypermethylated. We postulate from these studies that the patient has MPS II as a result of a mutation resulting in both the disruption of the IDS locus on her paternal X chromosome and unbalanced inactivation of the nonmutant maternal X chromosome.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"'High single-dose' European PUVA regimen also causes an excess of non-melanoma skin cancer. We report the results of a long-term (12.8 years) follow-up study of the detection of malignant and benign skin tumours in patients with psoriasis, who were treated with PUVA according to the European, 'high single-dose' regimen. A total of 13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 24 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) were diagnosed in 11 of 260 patients. The incidence of both SCC and BCC was increased in comparison with the general Dutch population. The ratio of SCC to BCC in the general population was 1:8 but was 1:2.5 in our study group. A positive correlation was observed between the development of SCC and the total UVA dosage, the age of the patient at the start of the PUVA treatment and a history of arsenic use. This dose-related increase in the incidence of SCC, reported in studies from the U.S.A., has not been found in earlier European studies. The average time period between the start of PUVA therapy and the diagnosis of the first malignant skin tumour was 6.0 years for SCC and 4.7 years for BCC.

In normal human epidermis, the Cu,Zn-SOD antibody almost exclusively stained the basal cells. Mn-SOD antibody weakly stained the whole of the epidermis but more predominantly the basal cell layer. In psoriasis, Cu,Zn-SOD antibody mainly stained the basal cells of the lowest parts of the elongated rete ridges. Basal cells corresponding to the tip of the dermal papillae were weakly stained. Mn-SOD staining was considerably decreased in the psoriatic epidermis. In squamous cell carcinoma, staining with both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD antibodies was decreased, and single cells positive for Cu,Zn-SOD were scattered throughout the tumour nests.

"The autologous mixed epidermal cell-T lymphocyte reaction is elevated in psoriasis: a crucial role for epidermal HLA-DR+/CD1a- antigen-presenting cells. The objective of this study was to determine whether epidermal cells (EC) from psoriasis lesions and uninvolved skin could stimulate autologous T lymphocytes in the in vitro autologous mixed epidermal cell-T lymphocyte reaction (autologous MECLR). The functional role of antigen-presenting cell (APC) subsets was concurrently determined in this reaction. Mononuclear cells and purified T lymphocytes from peripheral blood of psoriasis patients showed a clear proliferative response to autologous unpurified epidermal cells from involved as well as uninvolved skin. The autologous mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) was not elevated in psoriasis patients. In healthy controls and contact allergy patients, T-lymphocyte proliferation was not observed either in the autologous MECLR or in the autologous MLR. The level of proliferation in the autologous MECLR from psoriasis patients correlated to the number of epidermal cells that were added. To exclude the possibility that the observed proliferation in the autologous MECLR in psoriasis was due to the presence of epidermal T lymphocytes that were being stimulated and expanded in vitro, the stimulator EC were gamma irradiated (30 Gy) in some experiments. Preincubation of EC with cyclosporin A (CsA) significantly inhibited the autologous MECLR. The CsA-induced inhibition could be neutralized by the addition of fresh untreated EC to these cultures. This indicated that one of the modes of action of CsA in resolving psoriasis is, as some investigators have already shown, via inhibition of epidermal accessory cell function. In the autologous MECLR, APC from psoriasis skin could initiate this reaction, whereas APC from peripheral blood could not. This occurred in an MHC class II restricted fashion. Depletion experiments showed that Langerhans cells (HLA-DR+/CD1a+) were not the principal stimulators of autologous T lymphocytes in the MECLR. These results indicated that mainly HLA-DR+/CD1a- epidermal cells from psoriasis patients could stimulate autologous peripheral blood T lymphocytes in an MHC class II-restricted fashion.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Determining the best treatment for recurrent pruritic papular eruptions that do not fit well into a diagnosis (of either atopy or some other diagnosis) is sometimes frustrating. We have studied 12 patients with recurrent pruritic papular eruptions by obtaining extensive histories and by performing skin biopsies, immunofluorescence studies, and screening patch tests. The eruptions in this group are not atopic by strict criteria but have atopic features and are without a determinable exogenous cause. Histologic features resemble papular urticaria, but there is no history to suggest arthropod bites. Patients with this type of eruption have features similar to those with subacute prurigo, and they respond to variable combinations of topical or systemic corticosteroids, systemic antihistamines, and UVB or UVA.

"Prednisone inhibits the appearance of inflammatory mediators and the influx of eosinophils and basophils associated with the cutaneous late-phase response to allergen. To better define the effect of systemic glucocorticoids on the cutaneous early and late phase response (LPR), nine atopic subjects were examined in a double-blind cross-over study using skin chambers fixed over denuded skin blisters. A challenge was carried out by placing allergen in the chamber for 60 min in subjects who received either a 3-day pretreatment with 60 mg/day of prednisone or placebo. Skin chamber cell counts and inflammatory mediators (histamine, PGD2, and leukotriene C4 (LTC4)) were measured at hourly intervals for 12 h. Prednisone pretreatment did not alter the immediate skin erythema or release of histamine but ablated the late secondary erythema and rise in histamine. The median histamine values during h 10, 11, and 12 in the placebo and prednisone pretreatment visits were 3.73 and 0.22 ng/ml, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.02). Prednisone did not alter PGD2 production; however, LTC4 production was suppressed during the LPR. The cumulative median LTC4 values during h 7, 8, and 9 were 5.6-fold (p less than or equal to 0.05) more after placebo than after prednisone pretreatment. Prednisone altered cellular traffic more dramatically than it did inflammatory mediators. The influx of eosinophils, which peaked during the 9th and 10th h in placebo-treated patients, was completely blocked by prednisone (p less than or equal to 0.02) for every h from 6 through 12. The influx of basophils, which started during the 9th h and peaked during the 12th h in placebo-treated patients, was suppressed at all time points (p less than or equal to 0.02) in prednisone-treated patients. There was no significant alteration in neutrophil transit into the skin chambers induced by prednisone. We suggest that the selective blockade of eosinophil and basophil influx by prednisone and the associated decrease in inflammatory mediators may contribute to the blockade of the clinical expression of the cutaneous LPR.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Fibrel treatment was restricted to one or two implants in a maximum of four scars. The scar corrections were evaluated by the physician, the patient, and also via an objective photogrammetric method. At the end of 1 year the percentage of scars with moderate, marked, or complete correction were 65, 63.3, and 85.8% according to physician, patient, and photogrammetric evaluations, respectively. A cohort of 111 patients were followed for up to 2 years and 87 patients were followed up to 5 years postimplantation. The physician and patient evaluations showed 55.1 and 50.6%, respectively, of the scars in the moderate, marked, or complete correction category at the end of 5 years with only one or two treatments. Safety evaluations included tests for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and presence of antibodies to Fibrel and their crossreactivity to human collagen I and III. These tests did not show any causal relationship to Fibrel treatments and the patients did not have any untoward immunologic symptoms. The data from these patients demonstrate that one or two Fibrel treatments are effective in maintaining greater than 50% correction of depressed cutaneous scars up to 5 years with negligible adverse sequelae and no untoward immunologic symptoms.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Round fingerpad sign: an early sign of scleroderma. We describe a clinical skin sign in scleroderma termed round fingerpad sign. This term refers to disappearance of the peaked contour on fingerpads and replacement with a hemisphere-like fingertip contour; this change is especially apparent on the ring fingers. A positive round fingerpad sign was found in 72 of 72 ring fingers in 36 patients with progressive systemic sclerosis in 69 of 72 ring fingers in patients with mixed connective tissue disease, and in 24 of 24 ring fingers of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodactyly. In contrast, a negative round fingerpad sign was seen in 240 of 240 fingers in normal women (controls). The high sensitivity of this sign is noteworthy. A positive round fingerpad was seen in sign not only typical scleroderma patients but also in groups with less severe skin sclerosis (i.e., in those patients with mixed connective tissue disease or those with Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodactyly).

A third subgroup, A/4, exhibited more extensive genomic heterogeneity, but all isolates were distinguishable from those in subgroups A/2 and A/2V. Individual RSV epidemic seasons included isolates representing multiple subgroups of group A and multiple intrasubgroup variants, in addition to isolates from group B.

The subgroups may represent parallel evolutionary lineages, whose relevance to RSV immunity and pathogenesis requires further study.",Virus_Diseases
"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcripts identified in HIV-related psoriasis and Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. Persons with HIV infection sometimes develop aggressive psoriasis or Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) not usually seen in other immunosuppressed patients. However, a specific and direct pathophysiological role for HIV-1 in these AIDS-associated disorders remains unclear since HIV has not been easily detected in these skin lesions. By combining in situ hybridization with the sensitive detection technique of confocal laser scanning microscopy, we have demonstrated HIV RNA transcripts in 5 of 15 lesional skin biopsies from HIV-infected psoriasis patients, and in 3 of 8 Kaposi's sarcoma biopsies from HIV-infected patients. HIV transcripts were not detected in normal appearing skin from HIV-infected patients or in psoriatic and normal skin biopsies from uninfected individuals (P = 0.006). Although previous attempts to demonstrate viral sequences in psoriasis and KS lesions have been unsuccessful, in situ hybridization with confocal microscopy has shown the presence of HIV RNA transcripts predominantly within CD4+, Factor XIIIa positive dermal dendrocytes. HIV or cytokines produced by infected cells in skin lesions may therefore play a direct role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated psoriasis and KS.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Propofol as an i.v. anaesthetic induction agent in variegate porphyria. The choice of an i.v. anaesthetic induction poses problems for the anaesthetist confronted with a patient with one of the acute porphyrias. We undertook a prospective clinical trial in 13 variegate porphyric subjects using propofol as an anaesthetic induction agent. Urinary porphyrin precursors and porphyrins were measured before operation and 1-5 days after operation. Stool and plasma porphyrin concentrations were measured over the same period. Comparison of these data in the porphyric patients and in 21 control subjects over the trial period revealed no significant change in porphyrin or porphyrin precursor output after operation. Urinary porphyrin precursor concentrations did not exceed the limits established for variegate porphyric patients in remission, and there were no changes in the stool and plasma porphyrin profiles or any symptoms of an acute porphyric attack. We conclude that propofol did not appear to be porphyrinogenic when used for the induction of anaesthesia in 13 patients with variegate porphyria.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Computed tomography of the postoperative intervertebral disc and lumbar spinal canal: serial long-term investigation in 19 patients after successful operation for lumbar disc herniation. The first part of this work, published in 1988, included 25 patients who had computed tomographic (CT) scans without contrast enhancement and plain x-rays of the lumbar spine before, 1 week after, and 6 to 7 weeks after a successful operation for lumbar disc herniation. The present study extends the follow-up period to 3 years in 19 of the 25 original patients. Clinical examinations, lateral plain x-rays, and CT scans without contrast enhancement of the operated disc were repeated. The results indicate a decrease or even a disappearance of the hyperdense extradural material thought to represent fibrosis. An image suggestive of persistent disc herniation was still present in 5 of 8 patients with this finding on early postoperative CT scans. Persistent intradiscal gas was seen in nearly half of the patients. Total normalization of the posterior extraspinal structures was the rule. There was no correlation between CT appearance and residual complaints of the patients. CT scans without contrast enhancement may be sufficient to guide the surgeon in postoperative patients with massive signs and symptoms of recurrent root compression in whom a second operation is indicated on clinical grounds. In all other cases, myelography followed by CT scans is considered appropriate to investigate failed back surgery syndrome.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Analysis of methotrexate treatment effect in a longitudinal observational study: utility of cluster analysis. We studied 235 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) beginning therapy with methotrexate utilizing a k-means clustering algorithm. Four groups were identified: mild RA (Group 3), very severe RA (Group 4), and 2 groups intermediate in severity (Groups 1 and 2). Group 2, the largest of the clusters (n = 89), appeared to have greater tolerability of RA as measured by severity and psychological variables, and took the drug almost twice as long as other groups, although improvement was not greater nor side effects fewer. All groups improved over a mean of 1.9 years, and the degree of improvement was not related to the initial severity classification. Improvement occurred almost equally in all clusters, and the relative ranking of the groups was maintained at study closure.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Isolation of a human epidermal cDNA corresponding to the 180-kD autoantigen recognized by bullous pemphigoid and herpes gestationis sera. Immunolocalization of this protein to the hemidesmosome. Autoantibodies present in the sera of patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) bind to the basement membrane zone of normal human skin and commonly recognize two epidermal proteins, the BP240 and BP180 antigens. Two BP antigen cDNA clones from a lambda gt11 human keratinocyte library have been identified on the basis of reactivity with a BP serum. The fusion protein (FP) produced by one clone immunoadsorbed autoantibodies, which specifically recognized the BP180 by antigen, showing no cross-reactivity with BP240 by immunoblot analysis. The FP produced by the second clone immunoadsorbed autoantibodies which specifically reacted with the BP240 epidermal antigen. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the BP180 and BP240 antigens are encoded by distinct RNA transcripts with lengths of 6.0 and 8.5 kb, respectively. Immunoblot analysis of the BP180 lysogen extract identified a 135-kD FP which was recognized by 7 of 16 BP sera and 7 of 8 herpes gestationis sera. A rabbit antiserum prepared against the lysogenic BP180 FP specifically recognized the BP180 antigen from human epidermal extracts by immunoblotting, labeled the BMZ by indirect immunofluorescence, and bound to human epidermal hemidesmosomes by immuno-electron microscopy. These results indicate that the BP180 antigen recognized by BP and herpes gestationis autoantibodies is a unique hemidesmosomal polypeptide, distinguishable from the BP240 antigen.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"DNA sequence analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of the HLA-DQw2 alleles associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a blistering autoimmune skin disease associated with a 95-100% incidence of the HLA class II antigen HLA-DQw2. Although the precise role of this antigen in the pathogenesis of DH is unclear, one theory proposes that patients with DH possess a molecularly unique subtype of the HLA-DQw2 antigen that causes immune abnormalities eventuating in the clinical manifestations of DH. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA sequence analysis on the highly polymorphic HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 loci of eight patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. All DQB1 alleles sequenced were identical to the previously described HLA-DQB*0201 allele from HLA-DQw2 normal subjects. In addition, DQA1 alleles sequenced were identical to those alleles previously associated with HLA-DQw2 (DQA*0201, DQA*0501). These data document that although HLA-DQw2 appears to be a necessary element in the pathogenesis of DH, the development of DH is not dependent on the presence of a unique HLA-DQw2 antigen. HLA-DQ allelic typing by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 fragments was also performed in ten patients with DH to determine the allelic distribution among both HLA-DR3 (eight patients) and non-DR3 (two patients) DH patients. At the HLA-DQ beta chain locus, all patients possessed the DQB1*0201 allele. At the HLA-DQ alpha chain locus, all HLA-DR3 patients and one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0501 allele, whereas one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0201 allele. These data document that patients with DH do not express a unique HLA-DQw2 heterodimer, that the HLA-DQw2 molecules present in patients with DH have no DNA sequence differences from those found in normal HLA-DQw2 subjects and therefore that susceptibility to DH is not due to a unique HLA-DQw2 molecule.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

A 34-year-old man with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia, bronchiectasis, and chronic liver disease had a papular eruption on the trunk and upper extremities. A biopsy specimen revealed caseating granulomas, but special stains, cultures, and electron microscopy failed to reveal an infectious organism. Immunohistochemistry showed that the lymphocytes within the granulomas were almost exclusively of the CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T phenotype. Phenotypic analysis of the circulating lymphocytes showed normal numbers of CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD8+ T cells, whereas B cells were undetectable. Other examples of noninfectious granulomatous disease have been reported in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia, but this is the first case of caseating cutaneous granulomatous disease to be reported in a patient with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Two patients had a history of perineal condyloma acuminata; tumors from 1 of these harbored the genetic sequences of human papillomavirus type 6. One patient had multiple manifestations of cyclophosphamide-related urothelial injury, including bladder carcinoma.

"Antagonistic and agonistic effects of transforming growth factor-beta and IL-1 in rheumatoid synovium. We investigated potential mechanisms by which lymphocytes infiltrating rheumatoid synovium become immunosuppressed. In 20 of 22 synovial fluids and 12 of 13 synovial tissue culture supernatants, no IL-1 bioactivity could be detected in the thymocyte proliferation assay. These same preparations could, however, support proliferation of fibroblast monolayers, consistent with the presence of IL-1 and/or other fibroblast growth factors. Addition of either rheumatoid synovial fluids or synovial culture supernatants to exogenous IL-1 in the IL-1 bioassay caused marked inhibition of the assay indicative of an IL-1 inhibitor. This inhibition of IL-1 could be reversed by treating the effusions or supernatants with a neutralizing antibody to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Furthermore, monocyte-macrophages isolated from rheumatoid synovial fluid constitutively released both latent and active TGF-beta in culture at levels sufficient to completely block the biologic activity of 100 U/ml IL-1. The production of substantial levels of TGF-beta by synovial macrophages, as well as the apparent ability of these inflammatory macrophages to activate latent TGF-beta, implicates TGF-beta not only as an important inhibitor of IL-1-induced lymphocyte proliferation, but also as a key cytokine in promoting synovial fibroblast hyperplasia and pathology.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Applications of a computer simulation model of the natural history of CD4 T-cell number in HIV-infected individuals. Data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) of 1637 gay men, recruited in 1984 and 1985 in Los Angeles and followed at 6-monthly intervals, are used to develop a computer simulation model of the typical pattern of CD4 T-cell number changes in HIV-infected AIDS-free subjects. The empirical model incorporates the following features: (1) within-person and between-person variability in CD4 measurements; (2) variation in the rates of decline of CD4 values; (3) variation in the level of CD4 at which clinical AIDS is diagnosed, and (4) greater absolute variation in CD4 values in men with high CD4 levels compared with men with low CD4 values. Three applications of the model to assist in the design and interpretation of clinical trials are given. Further applications to clinical trials and to estimate the current and future spectrum of HIV-mediated immunological disease in the USA, as measured by the CD4 values, are discussed.",Virus_Diseases

The authors report a case of a patient who had bullous pyoderma gangrenosum at the site of previous eczema during treatment with G-CSF. The lesions resolved promptly when the drug was discontinued. Other investigators have recently reported inflammatory complications of G-CSF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but this is the first case report of biopsy-proven neutrophilic dermatosis associated with administration of a hematopoietic growth factor.

"The skin in mastocytosis. The most frequent site of organ involvement in patients with any form of mastocytosis is the skin. Cutaneous expressions include urticaria pigmentosa, mastocytoma, diffuse and erythrodermic cutaneous mastocytosis, and telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. The cutaneous lesions tend to appear early in life. Although urticaria pigmentosa has been reported in 12 pairs of twins and one set of triplets, the majority of affected individuals have no familial association. Most patients with systemic mastocytosis have skin lesions; however, an occasional patient will have systemic disease with no other skin features than flushing. In lesional cutaneous sites and in non-lesional skin, there is an increase in the number of mast cells. Electron microscopy shows quantitative differences between lesional skin mast cells from patients with and without systemic disease. The mast cells from adult patients with systemic disease have a larger mean cytoplasmic area, nuclear size, and granule diameter. The granules contain predominantly grating/lattice structures. The cutaneous mast cells contain tryptase and chymase. They retain their functional reactivities to relevant secretory stimuli, such as C3a, morphine sulfate, and calcium ionophore A23187. Lesional skin contains histamine, leukotriene B4, prostaglandin D2, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, platelet-activating factor, and heparin. Treatment of the cutaneous manifestations includes the use of H1 and H2 antihistamines, oral disodium cromoglycate, psoralens plus ultraviolet A photochemotherapy, and potent topical corticosteroid preparations.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Lincomycin injections for upper respiratory tract infections: a comparison of findings in a rural clinic with analysis of a national data base. A review of the records of patients attending a rural family practice clinic indicated that 13% had received ""cold shots"" (lincomycin with or without chlorpheniramine). The providers who assumed management of the clinic when the previous physician retired judged these injections inappropriate, but patients believed that they were effective and expected to continue to receive them. This study included 51 consecutive patients seen in the clinic for treatment of a cold and compared those who expected an injection with those who did not. Thirty-four patients (67%) expected an injection but instead received education about upper respiratory tract infections and symptomatic treatment. Half of these patients (17) were not satisfied with this alternative, and 10 reportedly went to another provider for an injection. Compared with patients who did not expect an injection, patients who did were older (P less than .001), had longer duration of symptoms (P less than .02), and were more likely to have tried nonprescription remedies (P less than .001). Analysis of the 1985 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey indicates that the administration of lincomycin is not uncommon (an estimated 800,000 injections were given in 1985) and that lincomycin is more likely to be administered by a rural solo physician practicing in the north central or southern regions of the United States.",Virus_Diseases

"Responsiveness to interleukin 4 and interleukin 2 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in atopic dermatitis. Although the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) is unknown, many immunologic abnormalities such as high levels of serum IgE and increase of IgE Fc receptor-positive lymphocytes have been demonstrated. Recently, interleukin 4 (IL-4) has been shown to induce enormously the production of IgE and to enhance the expression of IgE Fc receptor by B cells, suggesting the possible involvement of IL-4 in the pathogenesis of AD. We examined IL-4 responsiveness or interleukin 2 (IL-2) responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 31 patients with AD, 19 healthy individuals, and seven patients with other skin diseases. We found that IL-4 responsiveness of AD was higher than that of non-AD control, although IL-2 responsiveness of AD showed no significant change. However, the value of the IL-4 responsiveness did not significantly correlate with the clinical severity, personal history of respiratory allergy, serum IgE level, or clinical course of patients with AD. The hyperresponsiveness to IL-4 detected in AD was not likely to be due to the effects of steroids or anti-mast cell drugs because the value of IL-4 responsiveness was significantly low, compared to AD, in patients with other skin diseases who were treated similarly. Because the T-cell-enriched population, but not the B-cell-enriched population, showed significant proliferation in response to exogenous IL-4 or IL-2, T cells were the main population that reacted in our proliferation assay. These results indicate that IL-4-driven proliferative response may be efficiently operative in T cells in patients with AD.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Transmission of retroviral infection by transfusion of seronegative blood in nonhuman primates. Techniques such as polyclonal B cell activation with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis have documented the existence of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-and human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seronegative but infected humans and nonhuman primates. To establish whether blood from such seronegative but PWM- and PCR-positive monkeys can transmit infection, naive macaques were transfused with whole blood (n = 2) or cultured cells and supernatant fluid (n = 2) from two seronegative but PWM- and PCR-positive sooty mangabeys. After transfusion, three of the four recipients seroconverted, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all four recipients secreted SIV-reactive antibodies upon polyclonal activation in vitro and were SIV-positive by PCR that used highly specific gag primer pairs and probe. In addition, CD8+ cells from all four recipients markedly inhibited replication of SIV in autologous cells in vitro. These data suggest caution in the sole use of serologic tests for the detection of retroviral infection and document the ability of such blood samples to transmit infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Folic acid absorption in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. To determine the folic acid absorption characteristics of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a prospective, controlled, result-blind single-dose oral absorption study was conducted. A total of 25 subjects were fasted and given 5 mg oral folic acid; blood samples were taken at time zero and after 30, 60, 90 and 180 min. Absorption of folic acid appears to be significantly impaired in HIV disease, irrespective of the stage of the disease and notwithstanding gastro-intestinal complaints, pathogen-negative diarrhoea or drug treatment. We here present functional data, complementary to previously reported structural and biochemical findings, to support the hypothesis that the virus can cause an enteropathy in the absence of opportunist infection. Folinic acid is absorbed by the same gut mechanism as folic acid, so caution may be needed when employing oral folinic acid rescue procedures in these patients, even when resting serum and red cell folate levels appear to be normal.",Virus_Diseases
"Prior poliomyelitis-reduced capillary supply and metabolic enzyme content in hypertrophic slow-twitch (type I) muscle fibres. Capillary supply and oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities were determined in muscle biopsies from the tibialis anterior muscle in six prior polio patients and a control group. The polio patients, who had paresis and atrophy, but were able to walk normally by making maximal use of all remaining anterior tibial motor units, showed type I (slow-twitch) muscle fibre predominance with a mean (SD) of 98 (2%) type I fibres versus 81 (8)% in the controls (p less than 0.01) and muscle fibre hypertrophy, the average type I fibre cross-sectional area being 108% (p less than 0.005) larger than in the controls. The number of capillaries per muscle fibre was not significantly different from that in the control group, but with the increased muscle fibre area in the polio patients, the capillary density was significantly lower. The number of capillaries in contact with type I fibres relative to fibre area was 40% lower in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.005). The levels of citrate synthase and phosphofructokinase were significantly lower (38% and 33%, respectively, p less than 0.05) in the patients than in the controls, indicating decreased oxidative and glycolytic potentials in the muscle fibres of the polio patients. It is proposed that the abnormal high-frequency activation of all remaining motor units during each step cycle recorded in these patients constitutes a stimulus for type I muscle fibre predominance and hypertrophy but that the overall low muscle usage results in a decreased stimulation of capillary proliferation and mitochondrial enzyme synthesis.",Virus_Diseases
"Increased TNF-alpha secretion by alveolar macrophages from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) production by alveolar macrophages (AM) was evaluated in 17 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients without interstitial lung disease (ILD, Group 1) and 14 RA patients with clinical ILD (Group 2) in comparison with 10 control subjects. AM after recovery by bronchoalveolar lavage were selected by adherence, and then supernatants were collected after 3 or 24 h of culture. Results showed no modification of IL-1 synthesis in either group of RA patients. Spontaneous TNF production was significantly increased in Group 2 (2.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) as well as in Group 1 (2.4 +/- 0.4 ng/ml) compared with control subjects (0.43 +/- 0.1 ng/ml, p less than 0.001). In addition, AM from patients untreated or treated exclusively by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs produced similar levels of TNF, whereas those receiving corticosteroids, second-line drugs (such as sulfasalazine, aurothiomalate, and methotrexate), or the combination of both therapy regimens released significantly less TNF. Interestingly, TNF was not different in both groups, but Group 2 had a markedly increased ratio of local immune complex to albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (0.47 +/- 0.12 versus 0.07 +/- 0.02 in Group 1; p less than 0.002). TNF thus appears an additional component of RA subclinical alveolitis in RA, but its prognostic value and its precise role in lung damage remain to be determined.

The Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine Registry (RAAR) was established in 1982 to examine the safety of azathioprine (AZA) and other disease modifying agents (DMARD) in the treatment of RA. In yearly followup over the past 7 years, 20 malignant conditions have been reported in 530 DMARD treated adult patients with RA. Incidence density ratios (IDR) and standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were calculated to assess cancer risk. For all cancers the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.90-2.60). For men the SMR was 1.71 (95% CI 0.84-3.52); for women the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.89-2.60). Adjusted for age, the IDR was highest in the 70-79-year-old study population (3.41). The age and sex adjusted SMR for lymphoproliferative disorders and myeloma was 8.05 (95% CI 3.30-20.81). The SMR for lung cancer (n = 6) was also increased (3.37; 95% CI 1.58-7.34).

"Passive transfer of local immunity to influenza virus infection by IgA antibody. Secretory IgA is presumed to be the mediator of mucosal immunity based on many studies that show a correlation between protection and secretory IgA titers; however, a causal relationship has not yet been established. Classically, passive transfer of antibody has been used to demonstrate causality, but the passive transfer of local immunity with physiologically transported IgA has not been previously reported. In this study mice were injected intravenously with polymeric IgA (pIgA), monomeric IgA (mIgA), or IgG1 mAb specific for the H1 hemaglutinin of PR8 influenza virus. pIgA was shown to be specifically transported into nasal secretions relative to the mIg. The transported pIgA was functional, as evidenced by its ability to bind to virus in an ELISA assay and to protect nonimmune mice against intranasal infection with H1N1 but not H3N2 influenza virus. Intravenous injection of similar virus-neutralizing doses of anti-influenza IgG1 mAb did not protect against nasal viral challenge. IgA-mediated protection could be abrogated by the intranasal administration of antiserum against the alpha chain of IgA. These data demonstrate the passive transfer of local immunity by the i.v. administration of pIgA antibody and show that the IgA in secretions can protect against influenza virus infection. This general approach could provide a model for the evaluation of the role of local IgA in host defense against other pathogens.",Virus_Diseases
"Followup study of possible HIV seropositivity among abusers of parenteral drugs in 1971-72. Serum specimens obtained from a nationwide sample of parenteral drug abusers (PDAs) during the period 1971-72 had previously been screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. Some specimens were considered to be positive to both ELISA and Western blot (WB) analysis. These findings have been a topic of controversy, since HIV was not thought to have penetrated at-risk populations at such an early date. This study was a followup of those PDAs with apparent seropositivity to WB analysis. Of 10 persons followed, only one death (in 1985) was documented, and postmortem findings were inconsistent with HIV infection. Eight of the remaining PDAs were traced and found to be alive and well in 1989. Fresh specimens were obtained from the two persons with the strongest 1971-72 WB staining and were found to be both ELISA and WB negative on retesting. Their T-cell parameters were within normal limits. We concluded that the earlier WB results were most likely false positives and that definitive evidence of HIV infection in the U.S. addict population as early as 1971-72 is still lacking.",Virus_Diseases

"Identification of a major peanut allergen, Ara h I, in patients with atopic dermatitis and positive peanut challenges. Peanuts are among the most common causes of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to foods. Serum from nine patients with atopic dermatitis and a positive double-blind, placebo-controlled, food challenge to peanut were used to begin the process of identification and purification of the major peanut allergens. Identification of a major peanut allergen was accomplished by use of anion-exchange column chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, thin-layer isoelectric focusing, and IgE-specific immunoblotting. Anion-exchange chromatography revealed several fractions that bound IgE from the serum of the challenge-positive patient pool. By measuring antipeanut-specific IgE in the ELISA and in IgE-specific immunoblotting, we identified an allergenic component with two Coomassie brilliant blue staining bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a mean molecular weight of 63.5 kd. Examination of this fraction by the IgE antipeanut ELISA with individual serum and by the ELISA-inhibition assay with pooled serum, we identified this fraction as a major allergen. Thin-layer isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting of this 63.5 kd fraction revealed it to have an isoelectric point of 4.55. Based on allergen nomenclature of the IUIS Subcommittee for Allergen Nomenclature, this allergen is designated, Ara h I (Arachis hypogaea).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Education level and rheumatoid arthritis: evidence from five data centers. Data on 2,006 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for 1984 and 1986 were analyzed from 5 American Rheumatism Association Medical Information Systems patient centers to assess covariates of future disability. The dependent variable was the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index, measured in 1986. Independent variables, measured in 1984, include years of schooling, age, age squared, sex, labor force status, occupation, marital status, race, income, sedimentation rate, log latex, number of tender joints, and duration of illness. A negative association between schooling and the disability index is strongly apparent for men and weaker in women. Results for men persist even after adjustment for occupation and income, but not after additional adjustment for biological variables. The effects of schooling upon progression of RA are complex and interpretation requires simultaneous assessment of a variety of other variables. Causal effects of level of schooling are seen with a social science perspective which considers the biologic data to represent dependent variables yet cannot be inferred from a clinical model which considers the biology of the disease as an independent variable.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Survival and vehicular spread of human rotaviruses: possible relation to seasonality of outbreaks. In developing countries rotavirus infections account for nearly 6% of all diarrheal episodes and for 20% of diarrhea-associated deaths of young children. Even in industrialized countries rotavirus diarrhea in the young is among the leading causes of hospitalization. In temperate regions institutional outbreaks of the disease occur mainly in cold dry weather, whereas in tropical settings the seasonality is less well defined. Waterborne outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis have been recorded; air, hands, fomities, and food may also act as vehicles for this infection. Rotaviruses can survive for weeks in potable and recreational waters and for at least 4 hours on human hands. In air and on nonporous inanimate surfaces, the survival of rotaviruses is favored by a relative humidity of less than or equal to 50% and viral infectivity can be retained for several days.

The subjects were not selected for the presence or absence of cognitive or motor complaints. Complaints of cognitive and motor dysfunction were assessed with items from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Macro Neurologic Exam.

Psychiatric status was assessed with the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule, a structured interview that provides DSM-III psychiatric diagnoses. Actual cognitive and motor performance was measured with standard neuropsychological tests known to be sensitive to the effects of HIV. RESULTS: Cognitive complaints were found in 38 (49%) of the subjects. These complaints were associated with psychiatric symptoms but not with cognitive performance. Motor complaints, found in 12 (16%) of the subjects, were associated with poorer motor performance but not with psychiatric symptoms. The overall frequency of psychiatric diagnosis was high. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reports of cognitive and motor dysfunction were common in this unselected group and are of concern to health care providers. Potentially treatable psychiatric conditions were also common, particularly in subjects with cognitive complaints, and appropriate treatment referrals are indicated. Patients who report motor dysfunction should be neurologically evaluated for treatable causes.",Virus_Diseases

"A double-blind, vehicle-controlled study evaluating masoprocol cream in the treatment of actinic keratoses on the head and neck. This double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a new topical antineoplastic agent, masoprocol, in the treatment of actinic keratoses of the head and neck. Of the 113 patients who applied topical masoprocol twice a day for 14 to 28 days, there was a mean decrease in actinic keratoses from 15.0 to 5.4 and a median percent reduction from baseline actinic keratosis count of 71.4% at the 1-month follow-up visit. Comparable numbers for the vehicle-treated group were 13.4 to 11.1 actinic keratoses and 4.3% median percent reduction. Irritation, as manifested by erythema or flaking, occurred in 61.5% of topical masoprocol-treated patients versus 26.7% of those treated with vehicle and did not correlate with clinical response. Topical masoprocol appears to be useful in the treatment of actinic keratoses.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Elevated thymidine phosphorylase activity in psoriatic lesions accounts for the apparent presence of an epidermal ""growth inhibitor,"" but is not in itself growth inhibitory. An apparent tissue-specific growth inhibitor, or chalone, obtained from psoriatic lesions was tentatively identified in the 100-kDa fraction based upon inhibition of DNA synthesis, as measured by [3H]-thymidine uptake by a squamous cell carcinoma cell line, SCC 38. This fraction, however, failed to inhibit SCC 38 cell growth when assessed directly in a neutral red uptake assay. Characterization of the inhibitor of [3H]-thymidine uptake revealed it to have biochemical properties identical to thymidine phosphorylase: 1) molecular weight close to 100 kDa, 2) isoelectric point of 4.2, and 3) thymidine phosphorylase enzyme activity. Thus, we conclude that its ability to inhibit [3H]-thymidine uptake was due to thymidine catabolism rather than inhibition of DNA synthesis or growth inhibition. Examination of thymidine phosphorylase activity in keratome biopsies from psoriatic and normal skin demonstrated a twentyfold increase in activity in psoriatic lesions relative to non-lesional or normal skin. This increase in metabolism of thymidine was due to thymidine phosphorylase rather than uridine phosphorylase activity. The correlation between increased thymidine phosphorylase activity and increased keratinocyte proliferation in vitro (cultured) and in vivo (psoriasis), suggests that this enzyme may play a critical role in providing the thymidine necessary for keratinocyte proliferation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistulae in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV. Case report. Spontaneous bilateral carotid-cavernous fistulae and cervical artery dissection is reported in a 20-year-old woman with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV. The clinical features of 16 previously published cases of spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistulae associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV are reviewed, for a total of 17 cases. The mean age of the 14 women and three men was 31.6 years. Only direct fistulae were encountered. Diagnostic neuroangiography carried morbidity and mortality rates of 36% and 12%, respectively; neuroradiological treatment resulted in death in one of six patients. The possible value of desmopressin in the management of these patients is discussed. In view of the risks of arterial puncture and surgery, the authors emphasize the importance of early recognition of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Pregnancy outcome in patients with high titer anti-RNP antibodies. A retrospective study of 40 pregnancies. In a retrospective study the outcome of 40 pregnancies in 20 women with a high titer of anti-RNP antibodies was evaluated. In the 18 pregnancies that occurred after disease onset, transient proteinuria was noted in 3 and transient thrombocytopenia in 2. Deep venous thrombosis was observed in one patient. Preeclampsia in another woman necessitated cesarean sections in 2 pregnancies with successful outcome. The observed complications may all be seen in normal pregnancies. There was no evidence of exacerbation of maternal disease during pregnancy or in the postpartum period.

The autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (auto-MLR) was studied to test the interactions between immunocompetent cells in patients with psoriasis. The auto-MLR in 20 patients with psoriasis was significantly lower than in 16 normal controls. Lower values were found in untreated psoriatic patients than in those in remission following treatment. The values in the latter group were significantly lower than in controls and in six patients with atopic dermatitis in remission. The tendency for an increase in the auto-MLR with a decrease in disease activity was further confirmed in five patients studied before and after treatment.

"Analysis of antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigens in sera of patients with Sjogren's syndrome and with rheumatoid arthritis. To examine if Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with the two autoimmune diseases, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, IgG antibody titers of sera from patients with the disorders were evaluated for five constituents of EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA-1, -2, -3, -4, and -6). To circumvent interference by autoantibodies in the sera, fusion proteins synthesized in Escherichia coli were used as specific antigens. By ELISA the average IgG antibody titers to domains of the five EBNAs, especially the amino-terminal domain of EBNA-2, in sera of patients with Sjogren's syndrome were slightly higher than those in normal sera. The tendency of sera from Sjogren's syndrome patients to have higher reactivities to the EBNA domains was also observed by immunoblotting. By comparison, few heightened serologic responses to EBNAs were observed in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Further analyses are required to determine if EBV is associated with Sjogren's syndrome in any way.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Lamina repair and replacement to control laminectomy membrane formation in dogs. This study examined the efficacy of lamina repair by the use of various techniques to prevent postlaminectomy scar formation in a canine system. Five-level noncontiguous laminectomies were performed on six adult canines. The most caudal (Site 1) was left uncovered and served as the control. Exposed dura at each of the remaining four levels was covered with one of the following: Site 2, free autogenous laminar bone graft; Site 3, polymethylmethacrylate; Site 4, Teflon-Proplast composite; Site 5, collagen gel. The dogs used in the study were killed 16 weeks after surgery. Three specimens were examined by plain roentgenography and computerized tomography, two specimens were examined histologically, and the remaining four specimens were graded according to scar volume and scar adherence, as detected during gross dissection of the postlaminectomy scar. No repair technique interfered with roentgenography evaluation. The least scar and fewest adhesions were present under the free bone graft repair site. The Teflon-Proplast composite and polymethylmethacrylate both limited the amount and adherence of scar. Collagen gel and control sites were indistinguishable in this study. It is concluded that lamina repair with a solid material covering exposed dura significantly reduces the formation of postlaminectomy membrane and scar.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Identification of hepatitis A virus as a trigger for autoimmune chronic hepatitis type 1 in susceptible individuals. To identify factors contributing to the pathogenesis of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (CAH) healthy relatives of 13 patients with the disorder were followed prospectively for 4 years. 58 relatives were monitored for various serological markers and for T-lymphocyte migration inhibitory activity every 2 months. 3 cases of subclinical acute hepatitis A occurred during the study. In 2 of the 3 subjects, before hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection, there was a defect in suppressor-inducer T lymphocytes specifically controlling immune responses to the asialoglycoprotein receptor, an antigen expressed on the hepatocyte surface. In these 2 subjects, specific helper T cells and antibodies to the asialoglycoprotein receptor persisted and increased after acute hepatitis A, and autoimmune CAH type 1 developed within 5 months. Thus, in susceptible individuals HAV is a trigger for autoimmune CAH.",Virus_Diseases
"Persistent infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus enhances expression of MHC class I glycoprotein on cultured mouse brain endothelial cells. Brain endothelial cells (EC) represent a major component of the blood/brain barrier, which activated CTL cross to enter the central nervous system. Several viruses also penetrate the central nervous system through the blood stream via the brain EC. The studies reported here focus on understanding the principles and consequences of interactions among viruses, lymphocytes, and EC in the brain. As shown persistent but not acute infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus enhances the expression of MHC class I glycoproteins on the brain EC of mice. This increase in MHC expression during viral infection does not seem to result from the release of cytokines. However, replicative virus is required, because UV inactivated virus fails to enhance MHC expression. Viral determinants appear on EC surfaces after infection and serve as targets for CTL directed lysis. In contrast, neurons (OBL 21 neuronal cell line), which express negligible amounts of MHC class I glycoproteins, show no gain in MHC markers during persistent viral infection and are not targets for virus-specific CTL killing.",Virus_Diseases
"The liver, spleen, and lymph nodes in mastocytosis. In systemic mastocytosis the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes may be infiltrated by mast cells, with patterns of infiltration specific for each tissue. This may result in hepatosplenomegaly and enlarged lymph nodes. Extensive involvement with mast cells may also be associated with organ dysfunction. Specifically, in the case of liver, mast cell infiltration may result in fibrosis, portal hypertension, and abdominal ascites. Clinically significant involvement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes appears to be more common in patients with aggressive forms of mastocytosis, including those with a hematologic disorder.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Use of electron microscopy in examination of faeces and rectal and jejunal biopsy specimens. The stools and rectal biopsy specimens of 44 patients with AIDS and diarrhoea were examined by culture, light microscopy, and electron microscopy. In 13 patients examination of rectal biopsy material and faecal samples showed no pathogen, but in two of these, microsporidiosis was found by electron microscopical examination of jejunal biopsy specimens. This organism was also identified electron microscopically in one of the further five jejunal biopsy samples taken from patients with a known cause of diarrhoea. Blastocystis hominis infection was identified electron microscopically in six patients, all of whom had cryptosporidiosis additionally seen by light microscopy. Four of these six patients remained well for long periods, with only moderate diarrhoea, and follow up showed no evidence of blastocystis infection. In only four of 11 patients found to have cryptosporidium in their stools at light microscopy were organisms found at electron microscopy. Viral inclusions were only identified at electron microscopy in one of 10 patients with an opportunistic viral infection seen at light microscopy (cytomegalovirus n = 7, herpes simplex virus n = 3). No additional viral pathogens were detected in either stools or rectal biopsy material by electron microscopy. It is concluded that routine electron microscopic examination of stool samples or rectal biopsy material taken from patients with AIDS and diarrhoea is unnecessary and does not increase the yield of potential pathogens compared with standard microbiological techniques and histology.",Virus_Diseases
"A mutation in the pro alpha 2(I) gene (COL1A2) for type I procollagen in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII: evidence suggesting that skipping of exon 6 in RNA splicing may be a common cause of the phenotype. Fibroblasts from a proband with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII synthesized approximately equal amounts of normal and shortened pro alpha 2(I) chains of type I procollagen. Nuclease S1 probe protection experiments with mRNA demonstrated that the pro alpha 2(I) chains were shortened because of a deletion of most or all of the 54 nucleotides in exon 6, the exon that contains codons for the cleavage site for procollagen N-proteinase. Sequencing of genomic clones revealed a single-base mutation that converted the first nucleotide of intron 6 from G to A. Therefore, the mutation was a change, in the -GT-consensus splice site, that produced efficient exon skipping. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridizations demonstrated that the proband's mother, father, and brother did not have the mutation. Therefore, the mutation was a sporadic one. Analysis of potential 5' splice sites in the 5' end of intron 6 indicated that none had favorable values by the two commonly employed techniques for evaluating such sites. The proband is the fourth reported proband with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome VII with a single-base mutation that causes skipping of exon 6 in the splicing of RNA from either the COL1A1 gene or COL1A2 gene. No other mutations in the two type I procollagen genes have been found in the syndrome. Therefore, such mutations may be a common cause of the phenotype. The primers developed should be useful in screening for the same or similar mutations causing the disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evaluation of Social Security disability in claimants with rheumatic disease. We compared the Social Security Administration's (SSA) judgment of disability with uninvolved rheumatologists' evaluations of ability to work. With the cooperation of the SSA, 52 new disability claimants who alleged rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus were identified at the beginning of their claim. At the same time that their claim was being formally reviewed, they had a standardized examination by an independent rheumatologist who was not involved with their care, and they had a standardized test of observed performance. Rheumatologists' judgments of ability to work were compared with the SSA judgments. Rheumatologist and SSA judgments were in agreement for 35 of the 52 claimants (67%). All 11 claimants who met or equaled the SSA medical evaluation criteria were judged work-disabled by the rheumatologist. Of 27 judged able to work by the SSA, the rheumatologist judged 11 to be unable. Agreement between the SSA judgment of residual functional capacity and observed performance was no more than would be expected by chance. Most SSA judgments agree with a clinician's evaluation but a standardized physical evaluation by a rheumatologist and performance-based tests appear to add important information.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Remission and recurrence after withdrawal of therapy for ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune disease that scars mucus membranes and may lead to blindness. The authors studied the long-term effects of OCP in 104 consecutive patients (average follow-up, 4 years) to determine whether complete remission could be achieved after a course of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. Prolonged periods of remission while not undergoing therapy were maintained in approximately one third of patients with OCP. Follow-up must be continued for life, as relapse occurred in 22% of those who were in remission and not undergoing therapy. Those who relapsed regained disease control readily upon reinstitution of therapy and did not deteriorate to more advanced cicatrization. Sex, age, initial degree of inflammation, and the incidence of extraocular involvement did not have a prognostic significance on outcome. Mechanisms that underlie the differing responses to therapy are not yet known.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The treatment of mastocytosis requires a recognition of specific disease patterns of involvement, with consequent institution of appropriate therapy based on the disease pattern manifested in a given patient. Treatment for most forms of mastocytosis is conservative and symptomatic. H1 and H2 antihistamines in combination or alone remain the primary drugs of choice. In specific cases, patients may require aspirin and/or steroids; some must be prepared to self-administer epinephrine for severe anaphylactic episodes. In patients with associated hematologic disorders, the treatment of the disorder will depend on the hematologic findings. In rare cases, and in aggressive forms of mastocytosis only, it may be necessary to consider limited forms of chemotherapy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Acitretin in the treatment of severe disorders of keratinization. Results of an open study. The purpose of this open, noncomparative study with acitretin (Ro 10-1670) was to evaluate the clinical response of patients with various nonpsoriatic disorders of keratinization and to establish for these patients the optimal dosage for both efficacy and tolerance. Thirty-three patients (21 adults and 12 children or adolescents) with ichthyoses, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, or Darier's disease were treated for a period of 4 months. Most patients showed marked improvement or remission. The results obtained in congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, lamellar ichthyosis, and Papillon-Lefevre syndrome were judged as better than those usually reported with etretinate. The side effects observed in our patients were similar to those reported with etretinate, with the exception of scaling of palms and soles, which had an incidence and severity greater than expected with etretinate. The optimal acitretin dosage providing the best efficacy with minimal undesirable effects varied from patient to patient.

"Relationship of limited joint mobility to abnormal foot pressures and diabetic foot ulceration. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of limited joint mobility (LJM) in causing abnormal foot pressures and foot ulceration. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subjects were recruited from a general diabetes clinic where patients were screened for neuropathy, retinopathy, and elevated plantar foot pressure. Sixty-four patients in five groups were matched by age and sex in the following groups: group 1, patients with LJM and neuropathy; group 2, nonneuropathic diabetic patients with LJM; group 3, patients with neuropathy and no LJM; group 4, diabetic control subjects; and group 5, nondiabetic control subjects. Joint mobility was assessed in the foot at subtalar and metatarsophalangeal joints; plantar foot pressures were assessed by optical pedobarography and neuropathic status by a Biothesiometer and electrophysiology. RESULTS: Joint mobility was reduced at both sites in groups 1 and 2 compared with groups 3, 4, and 5 (P less than 0.001). Plantar foot pressures were significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 compared with groups 3, 4, and 5 (P less than 0.001). No differences in plantar foot pressures were observed between groups 1 and 2. There were strong correlations between plantar foot pressures and joint mobility in the foot (r = -0.7, P less than 0.001). Previous foot ulceration was present in 65% of patients in group 1, none in group 2, and 5% in group 3. CONCLUSIONS: 1) LJM may be a major factor in causing abnormally high plantar foot pressures, 2) abnormal plantar foot pressures alone do not lead to foot ulceration, and 3) LJM contributes to foot ulceration in the susceptible neuropathic foot.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Frequency and significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus in severe corticosteroid-treated cryptogenic chronic active hepatitis  To determine the frequency and significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in severe cryptogenic chronic active hepatitis (CAH), we tested sera from 17 corticosteroid-treated patients by an enzyme immunoassay. Specificity of the antibodies to HCV-encoded antigens was assessed by recombinant immunoblot assay. The findings in patients with and without anti-HCV were contrasted, and the frequency of seropositivity was compared with that in patients who had other types of chronic liver disease and in normal adults. Only three patients (18%) with severe cryptogenic CAH had anti-HCV. Sera from two of these patients were reactive by recombinant immunoblot assay; the other sample produced an indeterminate reaction. The frequency of seropositivity in patients with cryptogenic disease was not statistically different from that in patients with autoimmune CAH (6%), hepatitis B surface antigen-positive CAH (9%), or alcoholic liver disease (0%), but it was significantly less than in those with posttransfusion CAH (18% versus 75%; P less than 0.01). Seropositive patients tended to have lower serum aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-globulin, and bilirubin levels than seronegative counterparts, and they did not have histologic features of confluent necrosis at initial assessment. Two of the three seropositive patients, both of whom had been reactive by recombinant immunoblot assay, entered remission during therapy, and one, with an indeterminate reaction, died of liver failure. We conclude that anti-HCV occurs infrequently in severe corticosteroid-treated cryptogenic CAH. Seropositive patients may have less severe inflammatory activity than seronegative counterparts. Cryptogenic disease may improve during corticosteroid treatment, a result suggesting an underlying immunologic disorder in some patients.",Virus_Diseases
"Postnatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 from mother to infant. A prospective cohort study in Kigali, Rwanda  BACKGROUND. Although transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from mother to infant has been well documented during pregnancy and delivery, little is known about the possible transmission of HIV-1 during the postnatal period. METHODS. We conducted a prospective cohort study in Kigali, Rwanda, of 212 mother-infant pairs who were seronegative for HIV-1 at delivery. All the infants were breast-fed. The subjects were followed at three-month intervals, with Western blot assays for antibodies to HIV-1 and testing of mononuclear cells by a double polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using three sets of primers. To evaluate potential risk factors, each mother who seroconverted was matched with three seronegative control women. RESULTS. After a mean follow-up of 16.6 months, 16 of the 212 mothers became seropositive for HIV-1. Of their 16 infants, 9 became seropositive. One infant was excluded from the analysis because of a positive test by PCR on the blood sample obtained at birth. Postnatal seroconversion to HIV-1 occurred in four of the five infants born to the mothers who seroconverted during the first 3 months post partum, and in four infants of the 10 mothers who seroconverted between month 4 and month 21. In all cases, the infant seroconverted during the same three-month period as the mother. The main risk factor for maternal seroconversion was being single. CONCLUSIONS. HIV-1 infection can be transmitted from mothers to infants during the postnatal period. Colostrum and breast milk may be efficient routes for the transmission of HIV-1 from recently infected mothers to their infants.",Virus_Diseases
"Use of hearing aids by patients with closed mastoid cavity. Twenty-five patients who had undergone a closed-cavity tympanomastoidectomy in our Unit and wore a hearing aid in the operated ear were reviewed, and information was recorded on the use of the aid, and the patients' impression about it. The information obtained was analysed and compared with similar data from 39 hearing aid users of similar age with no history of ear surgery. Eighty per cent of the patients with a closed mastoid cavity were satisfied with the aid, and no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the impression about the aid (chi square 3.06, p = 0.08), or the problems with it, which, in most of the cases, were related to several changes of mould (chi square 2.19, p = 0.13).

"Major histocompatibility complex haplotypes and class II genes in non-Jewish patients with pemphigus vulgaris. Previous studies demonstrated that HLA-DR4 was markedly increased among Ashkenazi Jewish patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV), almost entirely as the common Jewish extended haplotype [HLA-B38, SC21, DR4, DQw8] or as the haplotype HLA-B35, SC31, DR4, DQw8, and that HLA-DR4, DQw8 was distributed among patients in a manner consistent with dominant expression of a class II (D-region or D-region-linked) susceptibility gene. In the present study of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes in 25 non-Jewish PV patients, DR4, DQw8 was found in 12 of the patients and DRw6, DQw5 was found in 15. Only 3 patients had neither. Only 1 of the DR4, DQw8 haplotypes was [HLA-B38, SC21, DR4, DQw8] and 2 were HLA-B35, SC31, DR4, DQw8; most were the presumed fragments (SC31, DR4, DQw8) or (SC21, DR4, DQw8) or DR4, DQw8 with some other complotype. Of the patients with DRw6, DQw5, all were DRw14, DQw5, and 6 had a rare Caucasian haplotype, HLA-Bw55, SB45, DRw14, DQw5. Four of 6 of these were found in patients of Italian extraction, as was the 1 normal example. The non-Jewish patients were of more Southern European extraction than our controls. This suggests that there are two major MHC susceptibility alleles in American patients with PV. The more ancient apparently arose on a haplotype in the Jews, HLA-B38(35), SC21(SC31), DR4, DQw8, and spread to other populations largely as D-region segments. The other arose in or near Italy on the haplotype HLA-Bw55, SB45, DRw14, DQw5 and has also partially fragmented so that many patients carry only DRw14, DQw5. The available data do not permit the specific localization of either the DR4, DQw8- or the DRw14, DQw5-linked susceptibility genes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Low allergenicity of clonidine impedes studies of sensitization mechanisms in guinea pig models. During clinical trials, a clonidine transdermal device has been found to induce clonidine-specific allergic contact dermatitis in up to 25% of patients during a treatment period of 1 year. Using 3 different guinea pig strains, development was attempted of an experimental guinea pig model that would allow for in-depth studies into the mechanism of sensitization, and a possible role of transdermal device components. Transient low-level clonidine allergy could be obtained only in a minority of animals, with severe sensitization procedures departing from epicutaneous applications, combined with intradermal (adjuvant) FCA injections. Sensitization was not potentiated by additional booster procedures, including cyclophosphamide pretreatment, nor any of the putative cofactors (UV-treatments, C. parvum or acetaldehyde involvement) studied. These results suggest that the persistent skin contacts in man, with transdermal devices for sustained drug delivery, generate unique conditions favouring the development of allergic contact dermatitis, which are difficult to mimic in experimental animal models. Thus, clinical allergy may develop even to extremely weak sensitizing drugs that can be safely used orally, and escape most currently available predictive contact allergy animal models. Clinical studies remain unavoidable for studying factors that may reduce sensitization rates to more acceptable levels.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A target-based model for increasing influenza immunizations in private practice. Genesee Hospital Medical Staff  OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of a population-based tracking system on influenza immunization rates. DESIGN: Thirteen practices with 45 physicians were randomized to a control and two intervention groups. SETTING: Private practices. PATIENTS: All patients aged 65 years and over who were seen in participating physicians' practices within the preceding two years. INTERVENTION: In both intervention groups influenza immunization rates for physicians were recorded weekly as cumulative percentages of their target populations, using a specially prepared poster. In addition, postcard reminders were sent to all the patients in one of the intervention groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Immunization rates in the two intervention groups were 30% higher than in the control group; the control group immunized 50% (2,405/4,772) of its target population, while the poster and poster/postcard groups immunized 66% (1,420/2,149) and 67% (2,427/3,604), respectively.

"Congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear in children: a clinical and histopathological report. Forty-one children with congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear seen from 1978 through 1989 are reviewed. The most common presentation was that of an asymptomatic white mass behind a normal intact tympanic membrane. Computed tomography (CT) scan was useful in documenting extension beyond the mesotympanum. Surgical removal was performed using an extended tympanotomy for lesions in the middle ear and tympanomastoidectomy for those that had extended into attic and mastoid air cells. Observation over an average 3.1-year period indicated that 80% of children were free of disease after initial surgery. Residual disease that required further surgery was present in 20%. The importance of early diagnosis of congenital cholesteatoma is strongly advocated. The prognosis is better when the cholesteatoma is confined to the anterosuperior quadrant of the middle ear. Seventeen patients in this study had such a lesion, and extended tympanotomy allowed removal of an encapsulated closed cholesteatoma with normal postoperative hearing and no residual cholesteatoma. The average age was 2.3 years. Temporal bone histopathological studies of three cases of congenital cholesteatoma demonstrate two distinct pathological types of congenital cholesteatoma. A ""closed"" keratotic cyst in the anterior mesotympanum, which is easily removed, and an ""open"" infiltrative type in which there is no containment of the keratotic debris and the cholesteatoma matrix is in direct continuity with middle ear mucosa. Surgical extirpation of the ""open"" type is difficult and more likely to be associated with residual disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Porokeratoses: immunohistochemical, light and electron microscopic evaluation. Punch biopsy specimens of 14 patients with porokeratosis of Mibelli (n = 1), disseminated superficial porokeratosis (n = 6), disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (n = 4), porokeratosis plantaris, palmaris et disseminata (n = 2), and punctate porokeratosis (n = 1) were obtained for light and electron microscopy for evaluation of possible differences between these clinical variants. Langerhans cells in close contact with early degenerating keratinocytes could be observed in the epidermis. To study the cellular composition of the epidermal inflammatory infiltrate immunohistochemistry was performed. These studies demonstrated that the predominant cell type in these infiltrates are helper T cells, intermingled with Leu-6+ Langerhans cells. Despite the clinical variation and possible different etiologic or triggering mechanisms, the immunohistochemical and morphologic changes in all types of porokeratosis are the same and seem to represent a uniform reaction pattern.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis by extracorporeal photochemotherapy. A pilot study. In a 6-month pilot study of 7 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, we tested a treatment involving the extracorporeal photoactivation of biologically inert methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen) by ultraviolet A energy to a form that covalently cross-links lymphocyte DNA; the injured cells are reinfused into the patient. Prior experimental studies had indicated that this regimen produces an immune reaction against antigens on treated T cells, and a clinical trial in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma had been successful. The current study patients were treated monthly, on 2 successive days (or biweekly, later on). Between 12 and 16 weeks of therapy, there appeared to be a breakpoint, after which the joint counts and joint scores of 4 of the patients began to improve. In 3 of the 4 patients, these measures eventually diminished by a mean of 71% and 80% of baseline values, respectively, and there was variable improvement in less direct indicators of clinical response. The joint counts and scores of the fourth patient improved modestly (by 33% and 59% of baselines, respectively) but he required alternative therapy, and those of the remaining 3 study patients did not improve. Mean slopes for the joint counts were significantly different from zero after the apparent breakpoint (but not before), whether one examined the 4 apparent responders (P = 0.01) or the entire group of 7 patients (P = 0.01). After completion of therapy, there was also a delay, of 2-3 months, in the clinical deterioration of those patients who had improved. There was only 1 mechanical adverse effect--a single episode of transient hypotension in 102 treatment sessions--and no toxic effects.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Comparison of newborn screening records and birth certificates to estimate bias in newborn HIV serosurveys. Implicit in the New York State Newborn HIV Seroprevalence Study is the assumption that newborns of all New York State residents are tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. We examined this assumption by describing that part of the 1988 New York newborn population not tested in the HIV seroprevalence study and assessing any bias contributed by this group. Of the expected total HIV specimens 1.5 percent were never received by the Newborn Screening Program, 0.5 percent were invalid specimens for which no repeat specimen could be obtained, and 1.7 percent were unsuitable or of insufficient quantity to be tested for HIV antibody. Thus 96.3 percent of all 1988 New York newborns were tested for HIV antibody. Black infants from New York City and low-birthweight infants were represented disproportionately among those not tested. Assignment of all untested newborn to HIV-positive status increased the seroprevalence rate 17 percent (0.64 percent to 0.75 percent).",Virus_Diseases
"Oral melanotic macules in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. A group of 217 patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were studied for 2 years, during which time pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa developed in 14 (6.4%) of them. The lesions were well circumscribed in some cases and diffuse in others. In some patients the macules enlarged or recurred after surgical excision. In two patients the macules appeared during the administration of zidovudine. Clinical and laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency was not detected in any of the patients examined. The histologic appearances were those of melanotic macules. No ultrastructural alterations of the melanocytes were observed. Two of these macules also contained Epstein-Barr virus, and in one case normal oral mucosa was examined and also contained Epstein-Barr virus in the epithelial cells. As a control group we examined 180 health care workers who did not belong to any risk category, and 30 intravenous drug abusers who tested seronegative to HIV. Oral melanotic pigmentation was found in eight of the control subjects (3.6%). The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.3097). Our study shows that oral macules do not occur more frequently in HIV-infected patients. However, the clinical behavior of these lesions appears to be different during the course of HIV infection. In some HIV-infected patients the cause of the macules might relate to the administration of zidovudine and antifungal or antibacterial drugs. In others the cause remains unknown and could be due to multiple factors.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

In 1989 and 1990, the incidence of measles increased dramatically among preschool-aged children in inner cities. The largest outbreaks occurred primarily among unvaccinated black and Hispanic children in large cities (e.g., Chicago [2], Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, and New York). However, measles outbreaks have not occurred in all large U.S. cities; differences in vaccine coverage could account for these variations.

"A current perspective on the role of eosinophils in dermatologic diseases. Eosinophils are frequently observed in cutaneous inflammation, but little is known of their significance in the pathophysiology of cutaneous disease. Recent studies of the structure, content, and activities of the eosinophil have shown that it has potent toxic proteins with the potential to mediate tissue damage. Furthermore, immunofluorescent localization of eosinophil granule proteins has shown that eosinophils disrupt in tissue and deposit toxic granule proteins. The deposition of granule proteins in several diseases is vastly out proportion to the number of identifiable cells and indicates that eosinophil involvement in cutaneous disease cannot be judged by the number of intact eosinophils in the tissue. Specifically, deposition of eosinophil granule proteins outside of eosinophils has been observed in eczematous lichenified disorders with elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E, in urticarial and angioedematous disorders, and in bullous diseases. The structural, compositional, and functional characteristics of eosinophils are reviewed, and evidence of eosinophil degranulation in cutaneous diseases is presented. Mechanisms whereby eosinophil degranulation may mediate pathophysiologic effects are also discussed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mediate the adhesion of eosinophils to endothelial cells in vitro and are expressed by endothelium in allergic cutaneous inflammation in vivo  We have compared the adhesion of 51Cr-labeled eosinophils and neutrophils to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cell (EC) monolayers that have been stimulated with IL-1, TNF, or LPS. Each agent stimulated the adhesion to EC of both eosinophils and neutrophils in a similar dose- and time-dependent manner. F(ab')2 fragments of mAb 1.2B6 (anti-endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM)-1) and mAb 6.5B5 (anti-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1) each inhibited partially, and to a similar extent, eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion to EC monolayers prestimulated with TNF (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. Greater inhibition of both eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion was achieved by combining the effects of mAb 1.2B6 with either mAb 6.5B5 or mAb TS1/18 (anti-CD18). These observations indicate that both ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 are involved in the adhesion of eosinophils and neutrophils to EC stimulated with TNF. In order to determine whether these molecules are expressed in vivo during allergen-induced late phase allergic responses in the skin, human skin biopsies were examined at 6 h after Ag or saline challenge with the use of an alkaline phosphatase-staining technique. Both ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 were expressed with greater intensities in Ag-challenged biopsies, suggesting that these molecules may be involved in granulocyte recruitment in vivo. The similarities we have established between mechanisms of eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion to cytokine-stimulated EC suggests that factors other than differential leukocyte-EC adhesion may be responsible for the selective accumulation of eosinophils at sites of allergic inflammation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Each was patch tested with nickel sulfate 5% pet., cobalt chloride 1% pet., and potassium dichromate 0.5% pet., and 28 had a positive reaction to 1 or more of the metals tested. This finding indicates the necessity not only for pre-employment patch testing in industries where contact dermatitis is likely to occur, but that patch testing should be done even earlier in school children, before they decide to enter certain occupations.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Hodgkin's disease. Clinicopathologic studies of 24 cases and preponderance of mixed cellularity type characterized by the occurrence of fibrohistiocytoid stromal cells. Hodgkin's disease (HD) was diagnosed in 24 patients who were either seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (21) or members of a high-risk group (three), but had not developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Clinical presentation of the disease was characterized by constitutional symptoms in all, especially fever (23/24) and disseminated disease (22/24) at diagnosis. Mediastinal adenopathy was rare. Bone marrow involvement was particularly frequent (12/24), and a positive bone marrow biopsy preceded lymph node biopsy in 5 of the 12. Histopathologic features of these tumors included an increased number of nonlymphoid stromal cells, i.e., histiocytic and/or fibroblastoid. In some tumors these fibrohistiocytoid stromal cells were arranged in bundles, but distinct nodule with birefringent collagen band formation was not observed. Twenty-two patients were treated, most with combination chemotherapy; one was untreated; one, unknown. Sixteen, including the one untreated, died with disease at 3 to 25 months; one died of an unrelated cause; four were alive at 3 to 24 months; three were lost to follow-up. Frequent bone marrow involvement at presentation suggests the usefulness of the bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis in subjects at risk, especially when they present with spiking fever of unknown origin. Contrary to most previous series, virtually all of our cases were of mixed cellularity type, characterized by increased fibrohistiocytoid stromal cells in place of depleting lymphocytes. The classic nodular sclerosing feature with birefringent collagen band formation was not observed. In conclusion, HIV-associated HD was characterized by advanced stage with fever at presentation, preponderance of mixed cellularity histologic type with increased fibrohistiocytoid stromal cells, and poor outcome. Hodgkin's disease in AIDS patients presents an intriguing biological model to study the role of stromal histiocytes in immunodeficient patients.",Virus_Diseases
"Effect of cyclosporine A on the hearing loss in Behcet's disease. Thirty-five patients with Behcet's disease (20 under cyclosporine A [CyA] treatment and 15 under the conventional therapy), 12 patients suffering from endogenous uveitis, and 35 normal subjects were evaluated audiologically before entering the study and were followed up for at least a year. Twenty-eight Behcet patients (80%) showed some degree of hearing loss. The averaged pure tone audiogram of the Behcet group showed statistically significant auditory deficits in comparison with that of the control group. None of either the Behcet group or the uveitis group showed any hearing deterioration during the follow-up period. Five Behcet patients under CyA therapy demonstrated improvement in their hearing. The difference between the two groups of Behcet patients (CyA versus conventional treatment) was found to be statistically significant (p less than .05).

"Esophagocutaneous fistula after anterior cervical spine surgery and successful treatment using a sternocleidomastoid muscle flap. A case report. An esophagocutaneous fistula following anterior cervical fusion is rare. A 61-year-old man had cervical myelopathy because of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine. Anterior decompression of the cervical spine and anterior fusion with strut bone grafting were performed. A second anterior fusion was done because the graft was dislodged after the patient fell out of bed one month after surgery. An esophagocutaneous fistula occurred three months after the second anterior surgery. One of the causes of this esophagocutaneous fistula was considered to be a pressure necrosis of the esophagus because of to projection of the bone graft. Conservative treatment, which consisted of wound drainage and intravenous administration of antibiotics, was tried but was unsuccessful. A good result was achieved by cancellous bone grafting, closure of the esophageal fistula, and transposition of a sternocleidomastoid muscle flap to the interspace between the esophagus and the cervical spine.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Detection of salivary HIV-1-specific IgG antibodies in high-risk populations in Zaire. Saliva and blood samples were tested for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antibodies in two high-risk populations in Kinshasa, Zaire. In a seroprevalence study of 458 sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attendees, 142 of 145 seropositive individuals had enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive saliva samples (97.9% sensitivity). All saliva samples from seronegative patients were ELISA-negative (100% specificity). Of the 142 ELISA-positive saliva specimens, 137 were also Western blot-positive (94.5% sensitivity). In a subsequent seroincidence study of 315 initially seronegative female prostitutes followed during 183 woman-years of observation, 9 of 14 women who seroconverted (7.7% seroincidence) had ELISA-positive saliva samples at the time seroconversion was detected. Only three of these saliva specimens could be confirmed by Western blot. Although salivary testing for HIV-1 antibodies using conventional assays was not sensitive in detecting recent seroconversions, screening of salivary samples for HIV-1 antibody provides a convenient alternative method for conducting seroprevalence surveys in populations in whom venipuncture is not possible or convenient.",Virus_Diseases
"The Edinburgh cohort of HIV-positive drug users: auditory event-related potentials show progressive slowing in patients with Centers for Disease Control stage IV disease. A two-tone auditory event-related potential (AEP) task was used to examine brain function in 206 HIV-positive individuals (infected by intravenous drug use) approximately 6-7 years after initial infection. Multiple regression analysis of AEP latency and amplitude components showed only small effects of past medical and psychiatric history, current symptoms and drug use on electrophysiological responses. HIV-positive patients had longer latency and reduced amplitude of the P300 (P3) component of the AEP compared with a normal control group, but were electrophysiologically similar to a matched control group of HIV-seronegative drug users. However, a lower P3 amplitude was seen in patients in Centers for Disease Control stage IV. One-year follow-up of 103 patients (50%) found significant lengthening of P3 latency in patients with stage IV disease but not in those with stage II or stage III disease. The results suggest that brain involvement in HIV infection can be detected electrophysiologically after the clinical diagnosis of stage IV disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Genome analysis of adenovirus type 31 strains from immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Adenovirus type 31 (Ad31) was isolated from 15 immunocompromised patients in 12 of whom seroconversion was also recorded. Ad31 infection has a substantial clinical relevance since 8 of 10 with lower respiratory tract infection and 4 of 4 with hepatitis died. Therefore, Ad31 isolates from immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts were compared by restriction endonuclease analysis. Nine genome types were identified among the 79 Ad31 isolates. Pairwise comparison of comigrating restriction fragments indicated that the genome types could be divided into three genomic clusters. Several Ad31 genome types were isolated from immunocompromised patients, but no highly virulent genome type could be found. A genome type was identified in a child with severe combined immunodeficiency who originally was infected with another genome type. This observation is suggested to have evolutionary implications.",Virus_Diseases
"Stimulatory response towards the 65 kDa heat shock protein and other mycobacterial antigens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Molecular mimicry between mycobacterial antigens and components of human articular cartilage has been suggested to initiate the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, the proliferative response of peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) mononuclear cells (MNC) towards a variety of mycobacterial antigen preparations was tested in patients with RA and various non-RA inflammatory joint diseases. The antigen panel included a recombinant 65 kDa heat shock protein of mycobacterial origin which has recently been shown to stimulate arthritogenic rat T cell clones. In our study, no significant response towards the 65 kDa protein was observed with PBMNC of patients with or without RA. When compared to normal donors, the reactivity towards heat killed BCG M. tuberculosis and purified protein derivative was reduced in the blood of patients with RA while enhanced in the non-RA group, however these differences did not reach statistical significance. The data obtained with PBMNC were in striking contrast to the proliferative response of SFMNC. In the majority of cases both with RA and non-RA joint diseases the latter compartment was far better stimulated by mycobacterial antigens including the 65 kDa protein compared to corresponding PBMNC. However, in some cases an enhanced stimulation of SFMNC was also obtained with tetanus toxoid. Our data suggest that the enhanced reactivity of SFMNC may be a common feature of several inflammatory joint diseases and is not restricted to RA. These findings may indicate a preferential homing of antigen reactive (memory) T cells to the inflamed joints while the circulating pool of lymphocytes is depleted of this population.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Vancomycin-induced red man syndrome. A total of 11 cases of red man syndrome collected among 650 children who had received vancomycin in our hospital between 1986 and 1988 (estimated prevalence 1.6%) were retrospectively analyzed. These 11 children were compared with 11 age-matched children who received vancomycin in whom red man syndrome did not develop. Of the patients with red man syndrome, 73%, and of the patients with no reaction, 45.4% received vancomycin for penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis-positive cultures, or because of history of penicillin allergy. No difference was observed in the dose per kilogram given to both groups (12.9 +/- 3.5 mg/kg per dose in those with red man syndrome vs 12.3 +/- 6.9 mg/kg per dose in control children. The duration (mean +/- standard deviation) of vancomycin infusion was 45.9 +/- 16.7 minutes (range 10 to 90 minutes) in patients with red man syndrome and 54.5 +/- 7.6 minutes (range 45 to 65 minutes) in the control group (P = .07). In the 5 children with red man syndrome rechallenged with vancomycin, slower infusion rates prevented or reduced the syndrome, which emphasized the fact that the rate of administration is the important determinant of red man syndrome in susceptible cases. Clinically, the syndrome developed at the end of the infusion in most patients, but appeared as early as 15 minutes after initiation of the infusion. It was mostly manifested as a flushed, erythematous rash on the face, neck, and around the ears. Less frequently, the rash was distributed all over the body.

"Tracheal stenosis and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation due to herpetic tracheitis. A 64-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with pneumococcal pneumonia that progressed to respiratory failure within one week, requiring mechanical ventilation. Despite a low minute ventilation and clear chest roentgenogram, multiple weaning attempts failed. Bronchoscopy revealed significant narrowing of the distal trachea with erythema, edema, and ulceration of the mucosa. Cytology of tracheal washings was consistent with herpes simplex virus, and the patient was successfully extubated following treatment with intravenous acyclovir. Bronchoscopy following acyclovir therapy demonstrated resolution of the inflammation and narrowing. Herpetic tracheitis is a rarely recognized reversible cause of tracheal stenosis, especially in a nonimmunocompromised patient. It should be suspected in patients without an obvious cause of failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, and can be successfully treated with acyclovir.",Virus_Diseases
"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection in an infertile population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in an infertile population. DESIGN: The study design included a retrospective anonymous survey of clinical data and screening for HIV-1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) in stored sera. Samples that were ELISA-positive were further tested by Western blot assay. Frequency distributions were analyzed by Fisher's exact test. SETTING: University tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS: Based on availability of stored frozen sera, the total study population included 182 of 304 consecutively registered infertile couples. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of the study population were found to have one or more risk factors for HIV infection. Of the 252 sera tested, 10 were repeatedly reactive by ELISA, and Western blot testing confirmed HIV-1 infection in one woman and two men. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively high HIV-1 seroprevalence (male: 2.6%; female: 0.6%) in a low-middle class infertile population emphasizes the urgent need to implement on-site HIV-infection counseling aimed at preventing the spread of disease to the healthy partner and fetus and to discuss therapeutic and reproductive options.",Virus_Diseases

That obstetricians were aware of maternal HIV infection in only 20% of infected pregnancies, indicates the extent to which HIV infection goes unrecognised in the heterosexual community.",Virus_Diseases
"Perturbation of differentiated functions during viral infection in vivo. In vivo relationship of host genes and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus to growth hormone deficiency. Retarded growth and disordered glucose metabolism secondary to growth hormone (GH) deficiency are associated with persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection of GH-producing cells in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Infected C3H/ST mice, which are H-2k haplotype, become GH deficient, and LCMV replicates in most (more than 90%) of their GH-producing cells. In contrast, BALB/WEHI and SWR/J mice, which are H-2d and H-2q, respectively, do not develop this GH deficiency, and less than 20% of their GH-producing cells are infected by virus. Yet all three strains infected at birth with LCMV strain Armstrong (ARM) carry equivalent amounts of virus in their blood, brain, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, and thymus throughout life. Of five additional H-2k murine strains tested, C3H/HEJ and CBA/N mice develop this GH-like disorder, whereas neither AKR/J, B10/BR, nor BALB/KAE mice do, indicating that the H-2K haplotype does not control the GH susceptibility. Furthermore C3H/SW mice, which have the H-2b haplotype on the C3H background, develop the disease, again negating any correlation with H-2k but inferring that the C3H background is responsible. One half of the hybrid offspring produced by crossing the C3H/ST GH-deficient strain with BALB/WEHI-resistant mice develop the disease, but the trait is not sex linked. F1 hybrid backcrosses with the susceptible C3H/ST parental strain or resistant BALB/WEHI strain indicate the involvement of more than two genes. Hence the development of a GH deficiency by LCMV-infected C3H/ST mice is not linked to the MHC haplotype, is not sex linked, and is not due to a dominant gene. Multiple genes are involved and these are related to C3H background.",Virus_Diseases
"Use of the polymerase chain reaction to detect herpes simplex virus DNA in paraffin sections of human brain at necropsy.

"Computed tomographic density of metastatic lymph nodes as a treatment-related prognostic factor in advanced head and neck cancer. Pretherapeutic identification of patients likely to benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy for head and neck epidermoid cancer is of interest. We retrospectively analyzed the pretherapeutic computed tomographic (CT) scans of lymph nodes of 70 patients with head and neck cancer. All 70 patients were clinically classified as having stage IV disease. The purpose of our analysis was to compare the prognostic value of CT node density with that of the following factors: age, T and N categories, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor site, histopathologic type of disease [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UNCT)], and type of local-regional treatment. A simple two-grade nodal density grading system was devised. The density of normal adjacent muscle was chosen as the density standard. A node was classified grade 1 if less than 33% of the node consisted of hypodense zones. A node was classified grade 2 if more than 33% of the node consisted of hypodense zones. Patients with grade 1 nodes had a complete response rate of 68% (21/31) compared with 8% (3/39) for those with grade 2 nodes (P less than .0001). The only other factor associated with complete node response was UCNT (P less than .03). However, node density remained the significant prognostic factor after adjustment for histopathologic type. Follow-up ranged from 16 to 44 months, with a median of 29 months. Patients with grade 1 nodes had a median survival time of 32 months versus 13 months for those with grade 2 nodes (P less than .01). A prospective study should validate the prognostic value of CT node density and its possible use in determining optimal multimodal therapy for advanced head and neck cancers.",Virus_Diseases

"Expression of human HLA-B27 transgene alters susceptibility to murine Theiler's virus-induced demyelination. Infection of certain strains of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus results in persistence of virus and an immune-mediated primary demyelination in the central nervous system that resembles multiple sclerosis. Because susceptibility/resistance to demyelination in B10 congeneic mice maps strongly to class I MHC genes (D region) we tested whether expression of a human class I MHC gene (HLA-B27) would alter susceptibility to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelination. Transgenic HLA-B27 mice were found to co-express human and endogenous mouse class I MHC genes by flow microfluorimetry analysis of PBL. In the absence of the human transgene, H-2stf, or v mice but not H-2b mice had chronic demyelination and persistence of virus at 45 days after infection. No difference in degree of demyelination, meningeal inflammation, or virus persistence was seen between transgenic HLA-B27 and nontransgenic littermate mice of H-2f or H-2v haplotype. In contrast, H-2s (HLA-B27+) mice showed a dramatic decrease in extent of demyelination and number of virus-Ag+ cells in the spinal cord compared with H-2s (HLA-B27-) littermate mice. In addition, none of the eight H-2s mice homozygous for HLA-B27 gene had spinal cord lesions even though infectious virus was isolated chronically from their central nervous system. Expression of HLA-B27 transgene did not interfere with the resistance to demyelination normally observed in B10 (H-2b) mice. These experiments demonstrate that expression of a human class I MHC gene can modulate a virus-induced demyelinating disease process in the mouse.",Virus_Diseases
"Naproxen-induced pseudoporphyria: a distinctive photodermatitis. A distinctive photodermatitis developed in 22 children who had been receiving naproxen for prolonged periods. The eruption was marked by erythema, vesiculation, or increased skin fragility characterized by easy scarring of sun-exposed skin. Results of biochemical studies for porphyria were normal, and other causes of photosensitivity were believed to be unlikely. Of the 22 patients, 21 had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; one patient had systemic lupus erythematosus. Twenty of the patients had fair skin and blue eyes. In each case, all findings except scarring resolved when naproxen was discontinued. Attention must be paid to complaints suggesting photosensitivity in children receiving naproxen.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Proliferating cells in psoriatic dermis are comprised primarily of T cells, endothelial cells, and factor XIIIa+ perivascular dendritic cells. Determination of the cell types proliferating in the dermis of patients with psoriasis should identify those cells experiencing activation or responding to growth factors in the psoriatic dermal milieu. Toward that end, sections of formalin-fixed biopsies obtained from 3H-deoxyuridine (3H-dU)-injected skin of eight psoriatic patients were immunostained, followed by autoradiography. Proliferating dermal cells exhibit silver grains from tritium emissions. The identity of the proliferating cells could then be determined by simultaneous visualization with antibodies specific for various cell types. UCHL1+ (CD45RO+) T cells (recall antigen-reactive helper T-cell subset) constituted 36.6 +/- 3.1% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of the proliferating dermal cells in involved skin, whereas Leu 18+ (CD45RA+) T cells (recall antigen naive T-cell subsets) comprised only 8.7 +/- 1.5% (n = 6). The Factor XIIIa+ dermal perivascular dendritic cell subset (24.9 +/- 1.5% of proliferating dermal cells, n = 6) and Factor VIII+ endothelial cells (23.0 +/- 2.3%, n = 6) represented the two other major proliferating populations in lesional psoriatic dermis. Differentiated tissue macrophages, identified by phase microscopy as melanophages or by immunostaining with antibodies to Leu M1 (CD15) or myeloid histiocyte antigen, comprised less than 5% of the proliferating population in either skin type. In addition to calculating the relative proportions of these cells to each other as percent, we also determined the density of cells, in cells/mm2 of tissue. The density of proliferating cells within these populations was increased in involved versus uninvolved skin: UCHL1+, 9.0 +/- 1.7 cells/mm2 versus 1.8 +/- 0.6 cells/mm2, p less than 0.01; Factor XIIIa+, 6.0 +/- 0.7 cells/mm2 versus 1.5 +/- 0.5 cells/mm2, p less than 0.01; Factor VIII+, 5.5 +/- 1.4 cells/mm2 versus 0.0 cells/mm2, p less than 0.05. The presence of preferential active proliferation of a T-cell subset in lesional dermis suggests that activating signals specific for this subset are contained within the psoriatic dermis in vivo. The activation of recall antigen-reactive T cells may be a driving force behind the dendritic cell and endothelial cell proliferation. Alternatively, the selective proliferation and expansion of these two constitutive cell types (Factor XIIIa+ and Factor VIII+) may result in signals that promote activation of UCHL1+ (CD45RO+) T cells.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Pattern of respiratory syncytial virus epidemics in Finland: two-year cycles with alternating prevalence of groups A and B. Time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay with monoclonal antibodies distinguishing between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) group A and B strains was used to analyze their prevalence in Finland during 1981-1990 among 3285 patients with laboratory diagnosis of RSV, most of them hospitalized. The group typing of antigens in 608 RSV-positive nasopharyngeal aspirates showed a regular alternation of group prevalence, following the cyclic occurrence of the virus. Group A predominated in 73%-90% of specimens from 1981-1982, 1985-1986, and 1989-1990, whereas group B predominated in 70%-100% of specimens from 1983-1984 and 1987-1988. The epidemiologic occurrence of verified reinfections in hospitalized children and the group typing results indicated that children greater than 6 months of age during the first infection were more resistant to severe reinfection with the homologous than with the heterologous group of virus. The study shows that group antigenic variation of RSV has a significant effect on the epidemiology of the virus.",Virus_Diseases

"Relative prevalence and risk factors of HTLV-I and HTLV-II infection in US blood donors. The clinical significance of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) infection, unlike that of HTLV-I, is unknown, and the major known association of HTLV-II seropositivity is with intravenous drug abuse. Screening of blood donors for HTLV-I, now routine in North America, does not distinguish this retrovirus from HTLV-II. To find out more about the seroepidemiology of and risk factors for HTLV I and II, blood from 480,000 volunteer donors in five geographically separate US urban centres was tested for antibodies to HTLV-I/II and HIV-1. Confirmed HTLV-I/II seropositive donors were then followed up by DNA amplification to distinguish type I from type II and by interviews focusing on possible risk factors. HTLV seroprevalence was 3.3 times greater than that for HIV-1 (0.043% vs 0.013%). DNA amplification on 65 of the 207 HTLV-I/II seropositive donors revealed that 34 (52%) had HTLV-II infection and 28 (43% had HTLV-I; 3 samples were uninformative. Interviews of 49 donors showed that whereas HTLV-I was principally associated with donor origin from endemic regions, the major risk factor for HTLV-II infection was intravenous drug use. The surprisingly high rate of HTLV-II infection in US blood donors raises important public health and donor counselling issues since HTLV-I infection is associated with adult T-cell leukaemia and a neurological disorder while the pathogenicity of HTLV-II is as yet unclear.",Virus_Diseases

"Growth factor-induced acceleration of tissue repair through direct and inductive activities in a rabbit dermal ulcer model. The roles of polypeptide growth factors in promoting wound healing and in directing the specificity and sequence of responses of different tissues in wounds are little understood. We investigated the influence of four growth factors on the rates of healing of a novel full thickness dermal ulcer placed on an avascular base in the rabbit ear. The wound model precludes significant wound contraction and requires new granulation tissue and epithelial cells for healing to originate centripetally. 5 micrograms (7-31 pmol/mm2) of platelet-derived growth factor-B chain (PDGF-BB), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) applied locally at the time of wounding resulted in a twofold increase in complete reepithelialization of treated wounds (PDGF-BB, P = 0.02 chi square analysis; bFGF, P = 0.04; EGF, P = 0.05); transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 significantly inhibited reepithelialization (P = 0.05). Both PDGF-BB and TGF-beta 1 uniquely increased the depth and area of new granulation tissue (P less than 0.005), the influx of fibroblasts, and the deposition of new matrix into wounds. Explants from 7-d old PDGF-BB-treated wounds remained metabolically far more active than controls, incorporating 473% more [3H]thymidine into DNA (P = 0.05) and significantly more [3H]leucine and [3H]proline into collagenase-sensitive protein (P = 0.04).

"Long-term follow-up of 120 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma treated with interferon alpha-2a. One hundred and twenty patients suffering from an AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma treated by 18 million units of recombinant alpha-2A-interferon daily were followed prospectively for a period of between one and six years. An overall complete response was observed in 35% of these patients; the figure was significantly higher in those who did not have a visceral localization or opportunistic infections. Total lymphocyte count, CD4 lymphocyte count, and CD4/CD8 ratio were significantly higher, and beta-2-microglobuline significantly lower, in the responders than in the non-responders. A multivariate analysis showed that localization of KS and CD4 count had independent predictive value, with an odds ratio of 35 for patients who had more than 300 CD4 cells at the onset of treatment versus those with less than 150. Patients whose initially negative p24 antigenemia remained negative during treatment had the highest frequency of complete response. Among patients with initially positive p24 antigenemia, those whose percentage decrease in antigenemia levels was greatest had a higher frequency of complete response. The cumulative probability of survival in responders was 62% at four years. These results demonstrate an anti-tumoral and anti-viral effect and prolonged survival in a group of patients whose initial immune parameters were relatively well preserved. However, these results do not permit us to conclude whether these well-responding patients were treated at the onset of illness, or whether their illness was naturally less evolutive.",Virus_Diseases

"Human papillomavirus type 1-associated squamous cell carcinoma in a heart transplant recipient. The occurrence of squamous cell carcinomas in organ transplant recipients with warts represents a good model to study viral carcinogenesis.

We present the case of a heart transplant recipient in whom multiple common warts, preepitheliomatous keratoses, and squamous cell carcinomas developed. The warts began 4 years after the transplantation and the first carcinoma occurred 2 years after the warts, all the lesions being on sun-exposed areas. Histologic signs of human papillomavirus infection were seen in all premalignant and malignant lesions. Furthermore, human papillomavirus type 1 DNA was detected by in situ molecular hybridization within one of the carcinomas. Human papillomaviruses, along with other carcinogenic factors, play an important role in the development of carcinomas, and benign types could be implicated.

"Are psoriatic patients at risk of heat intolerance? Sixteen young male subjects with psoriasis (mean of 4.9% of skin surface area involvement) and 10 healthy controls underwent a heat exercise test (40 degrees C, 40% r.h.) for 2 h. Rectal temperature (Tr), mean skin temperature (Tsk), heart rate (HR) and heat storage (dS) were measured and calculated. A sharper rise was found for all parameters in the psoriatic patients as compared with controls. Statistically significant differences were found in Tr after 60 min (37.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 37.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C in patients and controls, respectively) and at termination of the exercise (38.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 37.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C). Heat storage at the end of the first hour was 78 +/- 9 and 30 +/- 7 kcal in patients and controls, respectively. At the end of 120 min, heat storage in the study group increased to 87 +/- 14 kcal, while the control group stored only 30 +/- 7 kcal. Sweat rate was lower in the psoriatic patients (590 +/- 49 g/h) than in controls (691 +/- 42 g/h), even when corrected for healthy skin area (337 +/- 26 g/h/m2 compared with 370 +/- 24 g/h/m2). It is suggested that psoriatic patients have a reduced ability to dissipate extra heat during exposure to exercise in the heat.

We surveyed pediatricians, well-baby clinics, and pediatric nurse practitioners in our area and found that approximately half of them advised the use of hair dryers to treat or prevent diaper rash. We tested four widely available hand-held hair dryers to determine potential for inflicting burn injury. All of the dryers are capable of delivering air heated to at least 53 degrees C after 2 minutes of use.

"Increasing incidence of varicella hospitalizations in United States Army and Navy personnel: are today's teenagers more susceptible? Should recruits be vaccinated? Hospital records for 10,687 United States Army and Navy adult varicella (chickenpox) admissions were reviewed. Annual hospital admission rates for varicella increased more than fourfold in the active-duty army during 1980 to 1988 and more than 18-fold among active-duty navy enlisted personnel during 1975 to 1988. Fifty-seven percent of varicella admissions occurred in the most junior military members, aged 17 to 20. More than half of the total varicella admissions occurred in personnel with less than a year of military service. Multivariate analysis of the navy data confirmed increasing time-related trends of risk, suggesting a national temporal trend of increased varicella susceptibility in US teenagers and young adults.

"Acanthosis Nigricans, insulin action, and hyperandrogenism: clinical, histological, and biochemical findings. Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a frequent clinical finding in hyperandrogenic women. Its presence has been used to subgroup such women. We performed this study in order to determine the actual histological prevalence of AN and its relationship to sex hormone levels and insulin action. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal was determined by the euglycemic clamp technique, and neck or axillary skin biopsies were graded blind for the presence and severity of AN in lean and obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) and in age- and weight-matched normal ovulatory controls. AN was present on clinical examination in 11 of 13 obese PCO, 3 of 6 lean PCO, 4 of 14 obese normal, and 0 of 4 lean normal women. AN was present on histological examination in 13 of 13 obese PCO, 5 of 6 lean PCO, 13 of 14 obese normal, and 1 of 4 lean normal women. The severity of histological AN was most highly correlated with insulin-mediated glucose disposal (r = -0.61; P less than 0.001) rather than fasting (r = 0.46; P less than 0.05) or glucose-stimulated insulin levels (r = 0.48; P less than 0.01). The only sex steroid correlated with histological AN was dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (r = 0.46; P less than 0.01). We conclude that 1) clinical skin examination was very insensitive for detecting AN; 2) the best biochemical correlate of histological AN was decreased insulin action, rather than insulin or androgen levels per se; and 3) AN is a very common epiphenomenon of insulin resistance, and its clinical presence should not be used as a criterion for stratifying hyperandrogenic women.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Six-year retrospective surveillance of gastroenteritis viruses identified at ten electron microscopy centers in the United States and Canada. To identify the prevalence, seasonality and demographic characteristics of patients with viral gastroenteritis, we reviewed 6 years of retrospective data on viral agents of gastroenteritis screened by electron microscopy at 10 centers in the United States and Canada. From 52,691 individual electron microscopic observations, a virus was detected in 16% of specimens, and the yearly positive detection rate among centers ranged from 8 to 34%. Rotavirus was the agent most commonly observed (26 to 83%), followed by adenoviruses (8 to 27%, respiratory and enteric combined), and small round viruses (SRVs) (0 to 40%) which were second most common at two of the centers. Rotavirus and astrovirus detections occurred more often in the winter but seasonal trends in detection were not apparent for the other viruses. Of all astroviruses detected 64% were found in infants (less than 1 year); unlike the other agents studied SRVs were detected in a large percentage of infants (48%) and older children and adults (20%). Among hospitalized patients a majority of all astroviruses, caliciviruses and SRVs were detected 7 days or more after admission in contrast to both rotaviruses and adenoviruses which were more likely to be detected earlier. The data suggest that SRVs are common agents of gastroenteritis and may be important causes of nosocomial infections. Because of the relative insensitivity of direct electron microscopy as a screening method for SRVs, astroviruses and caliciviruses, these data probably underestimate the true prevalence of disease caused by these agents.",Virus_Diseases
"Treatment of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. Herpes zoster results from reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus. It is most common in elderly patients and immunosuppressed patients, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Zoster is often the earliest indicator of HIV infection. The acute course of herpes zoster is generally benign, but systemic complications may be fatal. Postherpetic neuralgia is the major chronic complication and is a difficult management problem. High-dose acyclovir (800 mg orally five times daily) has recently been approved for treatment of herpes zoster and, if started early, decreases the duration and severity of symptoms. In the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia, acyclovir does not appear to be effective, and the efficacy of steroids is questionable.

The capacity to clear IgG containing immune complexes from the circulation was studied in patients with coeliac disease (n = 13), dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 8), and coeliac disease with concomitant serum IgA deficiency (n = 4). A small group of patients with active ulcerative colitis (n = 4) was included as a bowel disease control group. Clearance was estimated by measuring the disappearance rate of a bolus dose of intravenously injected IgG coated autologous erythrocytes. The mean T1/2 of clearance was prolonged in both coeliac disease (86 (24) minutes) and dermatitis herpetiformis (111 (35) minutes), compared with healthy subjects (20 (5) minutes) and coeliac patients with concomitant serum IgA deficiency (T1/2 = 17 (6) minutes). Patients with ulcerative colitis had a prolonged clearance, with a T1/2 of 195 (63) minutes. Values of circulating immune complexes were measured by four assays; C1q binding and C3, IgG, and IgA containing immune complexes. C1q binding immune complexes were detected only in IgA deficient gluten sensitive enteropathy.

Patients were stratified according to whether or not there were bone metastases only. Four hundred twelve patients entered this trial; 378 were assessable for tolerability and 365 for efficacy. The overall response rates were comparable between FEC 50 (44.6%) and FEC 75 (44.7%), but both were better than the epirubicin alone (30.6%) (P = .04 and P = .0006, respectively). The complete response rate was better in FEC 75 (15.5%) than in FEC 50 (7%) (P = .025) or epirubicin (4%) (P = .002). Similar results were obtained in the group of patients without bone-only metastases. No difference in the three treatments was observed in the patients with bone metastases only. Mean durations of response were similar in the three groups, being 412 days, 440 days, and 350 days for FEC 50, FEC 75, and epirubicin, respectively. Patients without previous adjuvant chemotherapy fared better than those with previous treatment (without anthracyclines). Tolerability was fair in the three groups. Overall, the epirubicin-alone group showed better tolerance than the two other groups, which did not differ significantly. Time to progression and survival were not different among the three groups, but more early relapses occurred in the epirubicin and FEC 50 groups; survival seemed to be better during the first 8 months in the FEC 75 group, and the survival difference between the epirubicin group and the FEC 75 group was of borderline significance.

"Neuronal loss in the frontal cortex in HIV infection  In an attempt to elucidate the cause and mechanism of the dementia and other neurological disorders that can occur in HIV-1 infection, we have quantitatively assessed neuronal populations, by means of a stereological technique (the disector), in the frontal cortex of patients with HIV infection. Eleven of sixty-five brains in the Medical Research Council Central AIDS Brain Bank were selected for study. The selected patients died without opportunistic infection or neoplasm affecting the brain; they had HIV encephalitis or minimal changes. We compared their neuronal counts with those of eight control subjects (seven died of systemic illness, one of pontine haemorrhage which did not affect the cerebral hemispheres). The neuronal numerical density was significantly lower in the HIV group than in the control group (mean [SD] 307 [46] vs 499 [113] x 10(2) per mm3; p less than 0.001). This difference represents a loss of about 38%. There was no significant difference between the HIV subgroups, which suggests that neuronal loss occurs in cases of minor pathology as well as in HIV encephalitis.

"Risks and benefits of paracetamol antipyresis in young children with fever of presumed viral origin  To examine whether antipyretic therapy in young children is associated with potential risks (interference with enhanced host defences at febrile temperatures) or benefits (improved comfort and behaviour), a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of paracetamol was conducted among 225 children 6 months to 6 years of age who presented with acute (less than or equal to 4 days) fever (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C per rectum) without evident bacterial focus of infection. Parents were asked to give paracetamol liquid 10-15 mg/kg or placebo every 4 h as needed for fever and to avoid bathing, sponging, or other pharmacological agents. Parents kept temperature and symptom diaries and recorded changes in child comfort and behaviour according to a pretested, 5-category Likert-type questionnaire 1-2 h after every dose. There were no significant differences between treated and placebo groups in mean duration of subsequent fever (34.7 vs 36.1 h) or other symptoms (72.9 vs 71.7 h). Paracetamol-treated children were more likely to be rated by their parents as having at least a 1-category improvement in activity (38 vs 11%; p = 0.005) and alertness (33 vs 12%; p = 0.036) but no significant differences were noted in mood, comfort, appetite, or fluid intake. That overall improvement in behaviour and comfort with paracetamol was not impressive is underscored by the inaccuracy of parents' ""guess"" at the end of the trial as to which agent their child had received-45% correct guesses for paracetamol and 52% for placebo. The data suggest that the clinically relevant hazards and benefits of paracetamol antipyresis have been exaggerated.",Virus_Diseases

"A controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir in neonatal herpes simplex virus infection. Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group. BACKGROUND. Despite the use of vidarabine, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in neonates continues to be a disease of high morbidity and mortality. We undertook a controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir for the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. METHODS. Babies less than one month of age with virologically confirmed HSV infection were randomly and blindly assigned to receive either intravenous vidarabine (30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day; n = 95) or acyclovir (30 mg per kilogram per day; n = 107) for 10 days. Actuarial rates of mortality and morbidity among the survivors after one year were compared overall and according to the extent of the disease at entry into the study (infection confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth; encephalitis; or disseminated disease). RESULTS. After adjustment for differences between groups in the extent of disease, there was no difference between vidarabine and acyclovir in either morbidity (P = 0.83) or mortality (P = 0.27). None of the 85 babies with disease confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth died. Of the 31 babies in this group who were treated with vidarabine and followed for a year, 88 percent (22 of 25) were judged to be developing normally after one year, as compared with 98 percent (45 of 46) of the 54 treated with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -4 to 24). For the 71 babies with encephalitis, mortality was 14 percent with vidarabine (5 of 36) and with acyclovir (5 of 35); of the survivors, 43 percent (13 of 30) and 29 percent (8 of 28), respectively, were developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -11 to 39). For the 46 babies with disseminated disease, mortality was 50 percent (14 of 28) with vidarabine and 61 percent (11 of 18) with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -20 to 40); of the survivors, 58 percent (7 of 12) and 60 percent (3 of 5), respectively, were judged to be developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -40 to 50). Both medications were without serious toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS. In this multicenter, randomized, blinded study there were no differences in outcome between vidarabine and acyclovir in the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. The study lacked statistical power to determine whether there were sizable differences within the subgroups of those with localized HSV, encephalitis, or disseminated disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Association between development of lower lip cancer and tobacco habits. Tobacco use is considered to increase the risk of tumor induction. The purpose of this case-controlled investigation was to assess the association of tobacco habits and development of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip. Sixty-one patients treated for lower lip cancer, aged between 42 and 90 years, were studied. Age- and sex-matched healthy controls showed a similar exposure to tobacco in years and a comparable distribution of tobacco habits. Although the mean exposure factor (duration times exposure) was greater in the tumor group, no intimate correlation between lip cancer and tobacco was demonstrated. However, an increased, although small, occurrence of herpes labialis lesions was found in cancer patients. The hypothesis is presented that smokers experiencing recurrent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infections are more liable to tumor initiation, which issue will be subjected to a future study.",Virus_Diseases

"Cigarette smoking: a modifier of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection? Two hundred and two homosexual men enrolled in a prospective cohort study of AIDS risk were assessed for differences in the occurrence and progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with respect to cigarette smoking. Among subjects who were initially seronegative, smokers were more likely than nonsmokers to become HIV-1 seropositive (p = 0.03). After seroconversion, serum beta 2-microglobulin and CD4+ lymphocyte levels were elevated in cigarette smokers relative to nonsmokers (p = 0.02 for both comparisons), but both of these differences disappeared within 2 years. There was no detectable difference in the risk of AIDS or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with respect to smoking. Our data suggest that cigarette smoking may alter the immune response to HIV-1 infection, but it appears to have no marked effect on clinical outcome. They also suggest that cigarette smoking may be a surrogate marker for continued high-risk sexual behavior in homosexual men.",Virus_Diseases

"Plasma levels of interleukin-1-alpha in rheumatoid arthritis. Interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta) has been implicated as an inflammatory mediator in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but little is known about the related cytokine, IL-1 alpha, in this disease. IL-1 alpha has biological properties similar to IL-1 beta but, unlike IL-1 beta, remains mostly cell-associated. In this study plasma IL-1 alpha was measured by radioimmunoassay in patients with RA and in healthy controls. Plasma levels were compared with conventional measures of disease activity. The mean levels in the two groups were not significantly different and, within the patient group (n = 53), the only significant cross-sectional correlation was between plasma IL-1 alpha and ESR. In longitudinal studies, some individual patients had plasma IL-1 alpha levels that correlated with different measures of disease activity. We conclude that while IL-1 alpha may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of RA, its measurement in plasma seems to offer little of clinical value.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Scanning acoustic microscopy of neoplastic and inflammatory cutaneous tissue specimens. Acoustic microscopy utilizes high frequency ultrasound to generate microscopic images. The current study was designed to examine representative disorders of the skin by use of a reflective scanning acoustic microscope (R-SAM), and to determine whether the obtainable resolution was sufficient to render a microscopic diagnosis. An Olympus UH3 Scanning Acoustic Microscope was utilized with lenses producing burst wave frequencies at 600 and 800 MHz (600 and 800 million cylces/sec). Cutaneous tissue specimens representing 12 different neoplastic and inflammatory disorders were examined. Acoustic images of unstained sections were compared with conventional light microscopic study of sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. In most neoplasms examined, it was possible to make a specific diagnosis primarily from low magnification pattern analysis. Although individual cells could be visualized, cytologic atypia was poorly defined. In the inflammatory disorders, a specific diagnosis was possible in all but bullous pemphigoid and lichen planus, because the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate was difficult to determine. The advantages of the R-SAM include the capability of producing an acoustic profile of the tissue and the future possibility of in situ diagnosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Incidence of polymyositis-dermatomyositis: a 20-year study of hospital diagnosed cases in Allegheny County, PA 1963-1982. The incidence of hospital diagnosed polymyositis-dermatomyositis (PM-DM) among residents of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, PA was determined from 1963 to 1982. Medical records of all Allegheny County hospitals were searched for patients diagnosed PM-DM, and each accepted case was reviewed and verified by a physician, according to specified criteria. Direct age adjusted incidence rates were computed for race and sex, as new cases/million population/year, with the 1970 Allegheny County population as the standard. One hundred seventy-seven cases were identified during this 20-year survey for a total annual incidence of 5.5/million population. Incidence more than tripled during 1973-1982 compared to the first decade of study, with the greatest increase occurring in black women. Overall, the female to male incidence ratio was 2.2:1, but during the childbearing years (ages 15-44) this ratio increased to greater than 5:1 in both races. Detection of PM-DM is increasing, as shown by temporal trends. Although our series has significantly more adult PM and less DM and overlap cases than other published studies, annual incidence is similar to that reported in other locales.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Uroporphyrin overproduction was greatly reduced and skin changes reversed in a girl who received a bone-marrow graft from an HLA-identical sibling at 10 years of age. The patient died 11 months after transplantation because of severe progressive pneumonitis and encephalopathy associated with cytomegalovirus infection, but the encouraging response up to 8 months after engraftment indicates a possible benefit of bone-marrow transplantation in the treatment of this rare but usually fatal inherited disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Isolation of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 from Guaymi Indians in Panama. Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and with a chronic degenerative myelopathy. However, another major type of HTLV, HTLV-II, has been isolated only sporadically, and little is known of disease associations, transmission routes, and risk factors for HTLV-II infection. Recent studies indicate that a high percentage of certain groups of i.v. drug users and blood donors are infected with HTLV-II. Seroepidemiologic studies have found an elevated rate of seroreactivity to HTLV among Guaymi Indians from Bocas del Toro Province, Panama. To identify the cause of seroreactivity among this unique population we used HTLV-II-specific polymerase chain reaction techniques to detect HTLV genetic sequences from blood leukocytes of three seropositive Guaymi Indians. The HTLV-II primer-amplified polymerase chain reaction products from two of these subjects were partially sequenced and matched published HTLV-II nucleotide sequences in both p24 gag (94% of 107 bases) and pol (98% of 112 bases) regions. A CD4+ T-lymphocyte line established from one of these same subjects produced HTLV-II-specific proteins when tested in antigen-capture and immunoblot assays, as well as mature HTLV particles. The demonstration of HTLV-II infection in this geographically and culturally isolated Central American Indian population without typical risk factors for HTLV infection suggests that HTLV-II infection is endemic in this population and provides an important clue to potential natural reservoir for this virus.",Virus_Diseases
"Is diet important in rheumatoid arthritis? There is evidence from several well documented case reports that occasional patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may develop aggravation of their arthritis as a result of allergy to some ingredient in the diet. A variety of foodstuffs have been implicated including milk and milk products, corn and cereals. Total fasting results in improvement in rheumatoid arthritis, but appears to be mediated by diminution in production of chemical mediators of inflammation, rather than by elimination of a dietary allergen. There is conflicting evidence from studies using various intestinal probes that patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have a 'leaky' intestinal mucosa allowing food allergens to be more easily absorbed. Clinical therapeutic trials of exclusion diets have employed the standard strategy of the double-blind randomized method. However, this presupposes that patients entered into such a study are capable of improvement with dietary manipulation. Since this is often not the case, a more appropriate method would be to employ the 'intensive research design' also known as 'single case experiment' and 'N of 1' study. 'Masked food intolerance' is an attractive hypothesis, but extremely difficult to prove. It is doubtful whether fish oils and/or evening primrose oil will be of significant long term benefit for patients with RA. However, they do provide for the possibility that a fatty acid-like substance may be found which may be incorporated into cell membranes, thereby preventing production of mediators of inflammation, such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Asymptomatic and neurologically symptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals: prospective evaluation with cranial MR imaging. As part of a prospective multidisciplinary study of individuals seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed on 119 HIV-seropositive subjects (95 asymptomatic, 24 symptomatic) and the results were correlated with clinical data. MR images regarded as positive included those showing atrophy and/or white matter lesions. On the basis of these criteria, 96 subjects had normal MR images and 23 had abnormal images. Results of chi 2 analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the asymptomatic group (12 of 95 [13%] with abnormal scans) and the symptomatic group (11 of 24 [46%] with abnormal scans) (P = .001). In the asymptomatic group, positive MR images showed fewer, smaller, and/or less extensive abnormalities. The researchers conclude that (a) MR imaging can show indirect evidence of HIV infection early in the disease, but abnormalities will be minor and seen only in a small minority of neurologically asymptomatic subjects; (b) the appearance of clinically recognizable neurologic disease correlates with the MR imaging findings of increasingly severe brain atrophy and white matter lesions; and (c) in some HIV-seropositive subjects, despite neurologic disease, MR images can remain normal. Results indicate that routine screening with cranial MR imaging of neurologically asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals would likely result in a low yield of positive findings.",Virus_Diseases
"Effect of delayed captopril therapy on left ventricular mass and myonecrosis during acute coxsackievirus murine myocarditis. The effect of captopril on coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis was investigated. Thirty-two, 3-week-old mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 on day 0 of the study, then randomized into a placebo group or a captopril group starting on day 3 of infection. On day 9 of infection, the mice were put to death. Hearts were weighed and processed for light microscopic examination. Heart weight was 125 +/- 19 mg in the control group versus 102 +/- 14 mg in the captopril group (p less than 0.0003). Amount of necrosis as a percentage of left ventricular section was 3.5% (2.0% to 7.5%) in the placebo group versus 2.0% (0.0% to 5.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The amount of dystrophic calcification was 5.0% (0.0% to 27.5%) in the placebo group versus 1.3% (0.0% to 20.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The extent of the histopathologic involvement by planimetry was 10.2% in the placebo group versus 5.4% in the captopril group (p = 0.052).

"Cutting oil dermatitis on guinea pig skin. (II). Emollient creams and cutting oil dermatitis. The effect of repeated exposure of cutting oil on 8 guinea pigs' skin was evaluated by visual scoring for erythema and skin water vapour loss (SVL) measurement over a 6-week period. The visual scores (measuring severity of erythema) and SVL values were significantly higher on skin treated with cutting oils (positive control) compared to untreated skin (negative control) throughout the study period. The scores and SVL values returned to near-baseline values when cutting oil application was stopped. In addition, the effect of 2 ""after-work"" emollient creams on 8 guinea pigs' skin repeatedly treated with a cutting oil was assessed by similar methods. The visual scores and SVL values of guinea pig skin that was repeatedly treated with the cutting oil and moisturized with ""after-work"" emollient creams, were significantly higher than negative and positive control guinea pig skin. It appeared that the 2 ""after-work"" emollient creams do not alleviate the irritant effect of the cutting oil on guinea pig skin.

"Unrecognised HIV related deaths  OBJECTIVES--To establish whether follow up of deaths from selected HIV related causes could increase the number of cases of HIV infection reported to the Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC), and to estimate the proportion of deaths among HIV positive men that occurred in men who were not known to be HIV positive at the time of death by the person who signed the death certificate. DESIGN--Follow up of draft death entries received by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys on which one of 11 medical or external causes likely to be related to HIV was stated; letters were sent to the people who signed the certificates. The respondents were invited to report men known to have been HIV positive who were not already on the CDSC register. SETTING--England and Wales. SUBJECTS--Men aged 15-54 who died in February 1989 to July 1989 with one of the 11 selected HIV related diseases as cause of death on their death certificates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of men reported to the CDSC as a result of this follow up; estimate of excess deaths due to an HIV related cause; estimate of the proportion of excess deaths that occurred in those who were not known to be HIV positive at the time of death. RESULTS--Replies were received for 473 deaths (86%). Forty were for men known to have been HIV positive, 31 of whom had been reported to CDSC by the time they died; six were subsequently reported. The respondent did not know that the decreased was HIV positive for 20 (35%) of the 57 excess deaths in men for whom one of the medical causes was stated and 41 (93%) of the 44 excess deaths in men for whom one of the external causes was stated. CONCLUSION--Follow up of death registrations is not an efficient way of increasing the number of cases of HIV infection reported to CDSC. Between 35% and 60% of HIV positive people for whom certain causes are stated may be dying without HIV positivity having been diagnosed. There may be implications for those caring for people with these conditions and those who carry out postmortem examinations.",Virus_Diseases
"The effect of an elemental diet with and without gluten on disease activity in dermatitis herpetiformis. Elemental diets are reported to decrease activity of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. We tested the hypothesis that gluten, given in addition to an elemental diet, is responsible for the intestinal abnormalities, cutaneous immunoreactant deposition, and skin disease activity in dermatitis herpetiformis. At entry eight patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, who were consuming unrestricted diets, were stabilized on their suppressive medications at dosage levels that allowed individual lesions to erupt. Six patients were then given an elemental diet plus 30 of gluten for 2 weeks, followed by the elemental diet alone for 2 weeks. Conversely, two patients received an elemental diet alone for 2 weeks followed by an elemental diet plus gluten during the final 2 weeks. Small bowel biopsies, skin biopsies, and clinical assessments were done at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. Suppressive medication dose requirement decreased over the 4 weeks by a mean of 66%. Six of eight subjects significantly improved clinically during the gluten-challenge phase of the elemental diet and all were improved at the end of the study. The amount of IgA in perilesional skin did not change significantly, but the amount of C3 increased in five of seven evaluable subjects after gluten challenge. Circulating anti-gluten and anti-endomysial antibodies were not significantly affected by the diets. All subjects completing evaluable small bowel biopsies (seven of seven) demonstrated worsening of their villus architecture (by scanning electron microscopy and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts) during gluten challenge and improvement (six of six subjects) after 2 weeks of elemental dietary intake. We conclude that 1) there is a significant improvement in clinical disease activity on an elemental diet, independent of gluten administration, 2) small bowel morphology improves rapidly on an elemental diet, and 3) complement deposition but neither IgA deposition nor circulating antibody levels correlate with gluten intake. It seems likely that dietary factors other than gluten are important in the pathogenesis of the skin lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Intralesional interferon therapy for basal cell carcinoma. In a clinical trial of 172 patients at four medical centers, interferon alfa-2b (1.5 x 10(6) IU) or a placebo was injected directly into biopsy-proved noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas three times weekly for 3 weeks, for a cumulative dose of 13.5 million IU. Efficacy of treatment was determined at 16 to 20 weeks by examination of biopsy specimens that demonstrated cure of lesions in 86% of interferon-treated patients and in only 29% of placebo-treated patients. During the treatment course and follow-up, an initial inflammatory response was observed at the treatment sites, followed by diminished erythema, improvement in overall appearance, and a decrease in size of lesions. Side effects of treatment, mainly flu-like symptoms, were usually mild and transient and occurred more commonly in the interferon-treated group. Only three patients, all in the interferon-treated group, discontinued therapy because of side effects. One year after initiation of therapy, 81% of interferon recipients and 20% of those given the placebo remained tumor free.

"Trends of HIV seroconversion among young adults in the US Army, 1985 to 1989. US Army Retrovirus Research Group. Because soldiers in the US Army are recurrently tested for the presence of antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV seroconversion rates can be directly measured. From November 1985 through October 1989, 429 HIV seroconversions were detected among 718,780 soldiers who contributed 1,088,447 person-years of follow-up time (HIV seroconversion rate, 0.39 per 1000 person-years). Period-specific seroconversion rates declined significantly from 0.49 per 1000 person-years (November 1985 through October 1987) to 0.33 per 1000 person-years (November 1987 through October 1988) to 0.29 per 1000 person-years (November 1988 through October 1989). The HIV seroconversion risk among active-duty soldiers was significantly associated with race/ethnic group, age, gender, and marital status. Based on these trends, we estimate that approximately 220 soldiers (95% confidence interval, 160 to 297 soldiers) were infected with HIV during 1989 and 1990, with potentially fewer in future years.",Virus_Diseases

"Recruitment of neutrophils during IgE-dependent cutaneous late phase reactions in the mouse is mast cell-dependent. Partial inhibition of the reaction with antiserum against tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Much of the clinically important pathology associated with IgE-dependent disorders is thought to reflect the actions of the blood-borne leukocytes recruited during these responses. To evaluate the extent to which mast cells are responsible for the leukocyte infiltration associated with IgE-dependent cutaneous reactions, we attempted to elicit these responses in normal mice, genetically mast cell-deficient W/Wv mice, and in W/Wv mice selectively repaired of their mast cell deficiency by the intradermal injection of cultured mast cells derived from the congenic normal (+/+) mice. We found that the tissue swelling associated with IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions developed rapidly and diminished markedly from 2 to 4 h after antigen challenge, but remained detectable for at least 24 h after elicitation of the responses. Infiltration of leukocytes (predominantly neutrophils) also occurred at these sites, but reached maximal levels 6-12 h after antigen challenge, persisted at high levels for 24 h, and largely waned by 48 h. Virtually all of the tissue swelling and leukocyte infiltration associated with IgE-dependent cutaneous reactions was mast cell dependent. Intradermal injection of 40 U of recombinant murine TNF-alpha (rmTNF-alpha) elicited neutrophil infiltration similar in magnitude and kinetics to that observed after IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation. A rabbit anti-rmTNF-alpha (R anti-rmTNF-alpha) antiserum, which was able to inhibit 84% of the neutrophil infiltration observed after i.d. injection of rmTNF-alpha, inhibited IgE-, and mast cell-dependent leukocyte infiltration by 47 +/- 7% in three separate experiments. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha contributes to mast cell-dependent recruitment of leukocytes during IgE-dependent cutaneous late phase reactions, but suggest that other mast cell-associated mediators probably also contribute to this response.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

This study was undertaken in an effort to understand the role of cytokines in T lymphocyte trafficking into inflamed synovium and in the potential enhancement of antigen presentation by human synovial fibroblasts. We found that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) each increased the cell surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on human synovial fibroblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Maximal ICAM-1 expression occurred within 8 hours of induction, with the following order of efficacy: IFN gamma greater than TNF alpha greater than IL-1 beta. The number of cells bearing the ICAM-1 antigen also increased, from a basal level of approximately 30% to more than 83% after cytokine induction (for all 3 cytokines). ICAM-1 expression rapidly decreased following cytokine removal. The expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 was also examined, but it was not changed by any of the 3 cytokines. Class I major histocompatibility complex antigen expression was increased modestly by all 3 cytokines, and expression was maximal by 24 hours after treatment. Only IFN gamma induced HLA class II antigen expression, and this expression persisted for up to 6 days following removal of the lymphokine. IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor had no effect on any of the parameters examined.

"Interferon as an agent against herpes simplex virus. The effectiveness and limitations of interferon as an antiviral agent in man is exemplified by its actions against herpes simplex types 1 and 2. Given in adequate doses parenterally before or shortly after infection, interferon can ameliorate or reduce clinical manifestations or reduce the virus yield. It usually cannot completely prevent disease and may be particularly problematical if used late after infection in an acute disease. It is ineffective against the state of latent infection in ganglia. Interferon may have more potential in slower virus diseases and diseases in which other pathogenetic mechanisms affected by interferon's pleiotropic actions are operative.",Virus_Diseases
"Relationship of serum copper and zinc levels to HIV-1 seropositivity and progression to AIDS. Dietary, serum, and tissue levels of copper and zinc were determined at baseline in a cohort of homosexual men to investigate the relationship of these factors to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositivity and subsequent progression to AIDS. Using a nested case control design, 54 asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositives who later progressed to AIDS were compared with 54 HIV-1 seropositives who did not progress and 54 seronegatives (mean follow-up time 2.5 years). Serum levels of copper and zinc were estimated from frozen serum samples, tissue levels from stored toenail samples, and dietary intakes from a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. Neither dietary copper and zinc nor their levels in toenails were associated with HIV-1 seropositivity or progression to AIDS. However, serum copper levels were higher (p = 0.002) in HIV-1-seropositive progressors (mean = 115.6 micrograms/dl; SD = 17.1) than the seropositive nonprogressors (mean = 109.0 micrograms/dl; SD = 15.8) and the seronegatives (mean = 101.9 micrograms/dl; SD = 16.7). Conversely, serum zinc levels were lower (p = 0.016) in the seropositive progressors (mean = 85.2 micrograms/dl; SD = 11.5) than the seropositive nonprogressors (mean = 90.7 micrograms/dl; SD = 12.0) and the seronegatives (mean = 92.0 micrograms/dl; SD = 14.7). Furthermore, in a logistic regression, higher serum copper (odds ratio per 20-micrograms/dl increase = 2.23; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-4.87) and lower serum zinc (odds ratio per 20-micrograms/dl increase = 0.30; 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.66) predicted progression to AIDS independently of baseline CD4+ lymphocyte level, age, and calorie-adjusted dietary intakes of both nutrients.",Virus_Diseases
"Animal model for dermolytic mechanobullous disease: sheep with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack collagen VII. A severe congenital mechanobullous disease with dermolytic blistering and recessive inheritance is described in sheep. The affected animals of wild and inbred flocks of the breed Weisses Alpenschaf (WAS) have blisters of skin, oral mucosa, tongue, and esophagus at birth or within the first week of life. Exungulation occurs early, and severe erosions in the mouth lead to difficulty in feeding. Electron microscopic examination revealed sub-lamina densa splitting in natural or fresh friction blisters and absence of identifiable anchoring fibrils in clinically uninvolved skin. Antigen mapping localized laminin and collagen IV to the blister roof. Indirect immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to collagen VII, the major structural component of the anchoring fibrils, demonstrated a complete absence of reaction in clinically uninvolved tissues of the affected sheep, whereas in normal sheep a strong linear fluorescence was seen at the epithelial-mesenchymal basement membrane zone. Dermal extracts of normal sheep contained intact collagen VII, but epidermal and dermal extracts from the affected sheep lacked this collagen or its fragments in immunoblotting experiments. Based on genetic, clinical, ultrastructural, and immunochemical findings, the sheep disorder corresponds to the severe mutilating subtype of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa in humans and can be used as an animal model to investigate the human disorder.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Formaldehyde: an analysis of its respiratory, cutaneous, and immunologic effects. Formaldehyde is truly ubiquitous in our ecology and continuing important commercial applications. Most of us have daily contact with this chemical. The most significant outdoor source of this chemical is gasoline and diesel fuel combustion. The primary indoor source is combustion of tobacco products. Formaldehyde is associated with a disagreeable odor that can produce ""annoyance"" symptoms and at higher concentrations can be a transient and completely reversible irritant to the eyes and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. It is so soluble and rapidly metabolized that it rarely reaches the lower respiratory tract to inflict damage. The exception is in cigarette smokers who actively inhale. Formaldehyde may on rare occasions induce bronchial asthma at relatively high exposure doses. There are no conclusive studies that prove the development of de novo IgE-mediated respiratory tract symptoms secondary to inhalation of formaldehyde vapors. The approach to formaldehyde-induced symptoms should be one of careful documentation of objective physiologic changes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hepatitis C virus antibodies in chronic alcoholic patients: association with severity of liver injury. The prevalence of hepatitis C virus antibody and its relationship to the severity of liver disease in chronic alcoholic patients has been assessed, using a recently developed enzyme immunoassay and confirmed by a recombinant immunoblot assay, in 144 patients (mean age +/- S.D. = 44.4 +/- 11.3 yr) who had consumed greater than 80 gm/day ethanol for greater than 5 yr. Hepatic disease was evaluated by clinical and biochemical studies and by liver biopsy when appropriate. In addition, 76 liver biopsy specimens from these patients were analyzed to determine whether liver lesions were similar in alcoholic patients with and without hepatitis C virus antibodies. According to clinical and histological features alcoholic patients were divided into five groups: normal liver (45 patients), fibrosteatosis (20 patients), alcoholic hepatitis (14 patients), cirrhosis (61 patients) and chronic hepatitis (4 patients). Hepatitis C virus antibodies were present in 35 alcoholic patients (24.3%). The prevalence of hepatitis C virus antibodies correlated with the severity of liver injury: 2.2% in patients without liver disease, 20% in those with fibrosteatosis, 41.4% in those with alcoholic hepatitis and 42.6% in those with cirrhosis. Hepatitis C virus antibodies were found in one of the four patients with chronic hepatitis (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, patients positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies with normal liver or fibrosteatosis showed higher serum bilirubin and gamma-globulin concentrations and lower aminopyrine breath test scores than did patients negative for hepatitis C virus antibodies with normal liver or fibrosteatosis. Similar differences between patients with and without hepatitis C virus antibodies were observed in patients with alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis.",Virus_Diseases
"Cystic rheumatoid arthritis: description of a nonerosive form. In a study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 9% (n = 70) were found to have a cystic form. At radiologic examination of these patients with cystic RA, the first abnormality seen consisted of periarticular intraosseous cysts without erosions. The cysts were distributed symmetrically, most often located at the proximal side of the joints and predominantly around the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, and wrist joints of the hands and the first interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints of the feet. Computed tomographic scans showed the peripheral intraosseous location of the cysts. Magnetic resonance images showed that the cysts may contain fluid, inflamed synovia, or both. Cysts can be an important feature in the diagnosis of RA and a supplement to the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association. Osteoporosis, joint-space narrowing, and joint destruction occurred less frequently in patients with cystic RA than in patients with classic RA. Of the patients with cystic RA, 54% were male, and 50% were seronegative. This study is a supplement to and an enlargement on earlier descriptions of cyst predominance in RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection and virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. We describe two unusual cases of Epstein-Barr virus infection that were complicated by the virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, predominantly involving the spleen. Both patients were young adult men who presented with fever, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Both had prompt symptomatic and hematologic improvement following splenectomy. Severe constitutional symptoms recurred in one patient 1 month after splenectomy, and he died of septicemia 2 months later. In both cases, there was prominent hemophagocytosis in the splenic red pulp. Some hemophagocytosis was also noted in the liver from the fatal case. Unexpectedly, no hemophagocytosis was detected in the bone marrow biopsy specimens or marrow aspirates obtained from these patients. The DNA hybridization studies detected Epstein-Barr virus genomes in spleen samples from both patients, and both patients had atypical patterns of serologic response to the virus, suggesting that a defective immune response may lead to an unrestrained viral proliferation. We conclude that there is an association between chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection and the hemophagocytic syndrome, but that the tissue distribution of the hemophagocytosis may be variable.",Virus_Diseases
"Third place--Resident Basic Science Award 1990. Interleukin 1 causing bone destruction in middle ear cholesteatoma. We previously reported the localization of interleukin 1 in the epithelial layer of human cholesteatomas. On the basis of other studies that showed interleukin 1 can stimulate fibroblasts and macrophages to produce collagenases and prostaglandins, we then proposed that interleukin 1 may play an important role in cholesteatoma-related bone resorption, also. Our immunocytochemical study involving more human cholesteatoma samples revealed the presence of interleukin 1 in bone cells and monocytes in the region of active bone destruction. In the present study, the effect of interleukin 1 on these cells found at the bone resorption site was examined. By radioimmunoassay, interleukin 1 was shown to stimulate the production of prostaglandin E2 by osteoblasts in vitro. Interleukin 1 also promoted the migration and multinucleation of bone marrow-derived monocytes. These osteoclast-like cells formed from monocytes contained tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and caused the resorption of the devitalized bone in vitro. Above findings suggest that interleukin 1 could cause the bone destruction in cholesteatomas, not only by stimulating the local bone cells, but also by recruiting monocytes for osteoclastic bone resorption.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evaluation of WC3 rotavirus vaccine and correlates of protection in healthy infants. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of WC3 rotavirus vaccine was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of healthy infants 2-12 months of age; 103 received one dose of vaccine and 103 received placebo. Vaccination appeared to be safe and induced an antibody response (WC3 neutralizing antibody) in 97% of vaccinees. Only 9 (9%) of these, however, produced antibody to human rotavirus serotypes; at least 7 of the 9 were naturally infected before vaccination. Neither the number of symptomatic episodes of rotavirus diarrhea (21 vs 25) nor the number of moderate to severe rotavirus illnesses (9 vs. 15) was significantly different in vaccine or placebo recipients, respectively, during a predominantly serotype 1 rotavirus season. A slight but significant decrease in mean symptom score was detected in vaccine recipients. Despite an overall lack of efficacy, protection could be correlated to previous rotavirus infection, high levels of WC3 neutralizing antibody, and preexisting (maternal) serotype 1 neutralizing antibody with a titer greater than or equal to 30.",Virus_Diseases
"Lymphocyte population changes in cats naturally infected with feline immunodeficiency virus. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is associated with feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (FAIDS) and has been suggested as a model for HIV-induced human AIDS. The most obvious immunological defect in HIV infection is a reduction in CD4+ cell numbers and an inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio. To determine whether the same is true in FIV infection, we analyzed by flow cytometry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to feline lymphocyte populations the CD4:CD8 ratios in cats naturally infected with the virus. We report that 13 of 19 FIV-infected cats had ratios below the 5th percentile of normal cats (0.57, established from analysis of 39 normal cats) and 18 of 19 had ratios below 1. Repeated analyses over a period of several months revealed the inverted ratios to be consistent. Analysis of lymphocyte numbers in FIV-infected cats shows that the inverted ratios are due to a decrease in CD4+ T cells, while CD8+ T and B cells remain relatively normal in number. Analysis of a group of cats with a variety of other chronic diseases, including feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infections, revealed a near-normal distribution of CD4:CD8 ratios. These findings are similar to those in HIV infections and indicate that, like HIV, FIV causes a selective reduction in CD4+ cells and should be an excellent model for studying retrovirus-induced AIDS.",Virus_Diseases
"Morphological evidence for calcium-dependent association of calgranulin with the epidermal cytoskeleton in inflammatory dermatoses. The association of calgranulins, intracellular calcium-binding proteins, with the keratinocyte cytoskeleton has been studied. These molecules are expressed in various inflammatory dermatoses and in organ-culture explants. Triton X-100 extraction in the presence of calcium or EDTA suggested that calgranulins are detergent insoluble in the presence of calcium. The molecules were localized in a plaque-like structure at the cell periphery in lesional skin and in organ-culture explants. Following induction of calgranulins in vitro there was a redistribution of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton into a perinuclear halo, although desmosomes remained intact. These various features suggest that these members of the S-100 protein family have a role in cytoskeletal changes seen in various skin diseases.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hepatitis C viral RNA in serum of patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis: detection by the polymerase chain reaction using multiple primer sets. The recently introduced antibody test for hepatitis C virus infection has already proved to be valuable in many situations such as screening blood donors and diagnosing chronically infected patients, but this antibody assay has certain limitations. Hepatitis C virus itself is usually present in clinical specimens at very low titers; therefore a useful assay for the virus must have very high sensitivity. We have developed a simple, highly sensitive assay for hepatitis C virus RNA based on the polymerase chain reaction. In this test RNA extracted from hepatitis C virus-infected serum or plasma is used as the template for double polymerase chain reaction with nested primers. Sensitivity studies demonstrate that this assay is able to detect hepatitis C virus at or beyond the sensitivity level of chimpanzee infectivity. Preliminary studies in chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis showed that 16 of 36 patients positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus and 2 of 4 patients negative for antibody to hepatitis C virus were positive in the polymerase chain reaction test. By retesting the polymerase chain reaction-negative patients with several sets of polymerase chain reaction primers, we found hepatitis C virus RNA in 35 of the 40 patients including all 4 seronegative patients. Normal human plasma and plasma from patients with hepatitis B infection did not react in this test. This assay has proved to be valuable for determining the presence of hepatitis C virus RNA in various samples. Furthermore, it offers the possibility of diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection in patients who do not react in the presently available antibody tests.",Virus_Diseases
"Aberrant proliferation of lumen-forming cells in stratified epithelium of porokeratosis skin. The present investigation was based on the postulate, first proposed by Reed and Leone in 1970, that porokeratosis lesions represent clonal growth of epidermal cells. Comparative studies using immunocytochemical staining, epidermal cell culture, and non-equilibrium pH gradient (NEpHG) gel electrophoresis analysis of the keratins extracted were carried out on five patients with various types of porokeratosis. Positive type IV collagen staining on the stratum corneum was found in lesional skin specimens of all patients, but not in normal controls. A search for connections between type IV collagen in the basement membrane of epidermis and the skin surface disclosed infrequent intra-epidermal streaking of type IV collagen and one positively stained trans-epidermal acrosyringium. Positive intra-epidermal laminin staining in porokeratosis lesions confirmed the trans-epidermal passage of basement-membrane materials. Epidermal cells cultured from lesional skin showed low plating efficiency, and all colonies exhibited intracytoplasmic vacuole formation and excessive top cell shedding. NEpHG gel electrophoresis of keratins extracted showed that lesional profiles not only contained keratins normally present in glabrous skin, but also possibly K9 and some additional proteins. K9 had been immunolocalized to periductal cells in previous studies. Our findings, taken together, strongly suggest that porokeratosis epidermis consists of epithelial cells with lumen-forming ability.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Oral soft tissues in hereditary epidermolysis bullosa. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is associated with diverse oral manifestations, which can potentially involve both hard and soft tissues, depending on the specific EB subtype. This study determined the frequency and extent of oral soft tissue involvement in the inherited forms of EB. Examination of 216 affected persons revealed significant differences in the oral soft tissue involvement among the various types of EB. The frequency of oral involvement was greater in the dominant dystrophic (81.1%) and simplex (generalized, 58.6%; localized, 34.7%) types than previously reported. The marked frequency of oral blistering was similar in both major subtypes of junctional (Herlitz, 83.3%; non-Herlitz, 91.6%) and recessive dystrophic EB (generalized, 100%; localized, 92.3%). Obliteration of the oral vestibule, ankyloglossia, and microstomia were consistent findings in generalized recessive dystrophic EB. Oral milia were present in all major EB categories, most prevalently in the dystrophic forms, but were not seen in all the distinct EB subtypes. These findings indicate that although there are no pathognomonic intraoral soft tissue manifestations in the various forms of inherited EB, there are predictable patterns of involvement associated with specific subtypes of this disease. Understanding the oral involvement associated with EB may aid clinicians in the development of more advanced therapeutic approaches that are compatible with and directed at the unique characteristics of each EB subtype.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Parotid enlargement in children seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus: imaging findings. We investigated the clinical, immunologic, and imaging features of parotid enlargement in 10 children seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were infected prenatally. In seven patients, sonography revealed many small hypoechoic areas suggestive of lymphoid infiltration. In three older children, large anechoic areas suggesting lymphoepithelial cysts were present. The lesions probably represent generalized lymphoid infiltration akin to pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia, although only two of our patients had radiologic evidence of pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia. Four of five of the children with parotid enlargement who had immunologic studies were phenotypically HLA-DR5, an immunophenotype associated with improved immune response, occurring in less than one in four in the normal population. This suggests that painless parotid enlargement may be a good prognostic sign in HIV-seropositive children. Parotid enlargement was found in 10 HIV-positive children from 6 months to 11 years old. All except one were infected prenatally.",Virus_Diseases

"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mitigates the neutropenia of combined interferon alfa and zidovudine treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. The combined use of zidovudine (ZDV) and interferon (IFN) alfa-2a has been shown to have antiretroviral and antitumor potential benefit in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). However, the clinical use of this combination is frequently complicated by the overlapping myelotoxicity of these agents. We report here the results of a phase I/II study in which granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was used for those KS patients who became neutropenic while receiving ZDV (1,200 mg/d) and IFN (9 x 10(6) U/d). Nineteen of 29 patients (66%) developed an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1,000 cells per cubic millimeter and were begun on GM-CSF. All experienced a prompt increase in the ANC. Those patients receiving GM-CSF/ZDV/IFN alfa-2a had an improved end of study ANC when compared with the ZDV/IFN alfa-2a group, but did not have an increased rate of tumor response, end of study CD4 cell count, or improvement in any other hematologic variable. The use of GM-CSF was not associated with increased toxicity and, in particular, was not associated with a change in serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen. Tumor response was noted in 50% of the assessable patients (33% overall) despite ""high-risk"" characteristics in 80%. Of the responding patients, seven were on GM-CSF and might have otherwise required an alteration in ZDV/IFN alfa-2a dose level. Further study of GM-CSF as an alternate to dose modification of this (ZDV/IFN alfa-2a) and other combination therapies for AIDS patients is warranted.",Virus_Diseases

"Expression of major histocompatibility complex and HIV antigens within the brains of AIDS patients. HIV establishes a chronic infection in the central nervous system (CNS) of AIDS patients. The immunopathogenesis of this chronic encephalitis is unknown. Because of the importance of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and class II antigens in modulating the immune response, we examined the tissue expression of MHC molecules in relation to CNS damage and expression of viral antigens. By immunocytochemical staining we found that beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) expression is elevated in all cases with signs of viral encephalitis. beta 2M was expressed at high levels on endothelial cells, macrophages and possible oligodendroglia within regions of histopathology. In histologically normal regions elevated expression of beta 2M was noted only on endothelial cells. MHC class II expression was elevated only in the HIV encephalitis cases, and was restricted to macrophages/microglia and occasional endothelial cells. When compared with other viral encephalitides these findings suggest that the intra-CNS immune response to HIV is appropriate for viral presentation; however, the absence of responsive systemic T cells may lead to chronic viral infection.",Virus_Diseases

"Serum androsterone conjugates differentiate between acne and hirsutism in hyperandrogenic women. OBJECTIVE: To determine if among hyperandrogenic women acne may be differentiated from hirsutism by markers of peripheral androgen metabolism. DESIGN: Prospective outpatient study of 36 hyperandrogenic women and controls divided into groups based on the presence or absence of significant hirsutism and the presence or absence of moderate to severe acne. Serum levels of adrenal and ovarian derived androgens were elevated but similar in all patient groups. INTERVENTIONS: Measurement of serum androgens including metabolites of 5 alpha-reductase activity: 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide and sulfate and androsterone (A) glucuronide and sulfate. RESULTS: 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide and sulfate were elevated in all groups (P less than 0.05) and could differentiate between hirsute and nonhirsute patients but were similar in patients with and without acne. Serum A glucuronide and sulfate were only significantly elevated in patients with acne (P less than 0.01) and were higher than levels in controls and hirsute patients without acne. Ratios of precursor androgens to A glucuronide and sulfate were significantly higher in patients with acne compared with patients without acne (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Altered peripheral metabolism in acne may favor the formation of A conjugates, which may help differentiate acne from hirsutism among hyperandrogenic women.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

We investigated the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies to C1q in serum samples from 80 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 31 patients with rheumatoid vasculitis, and 80 healthy controls. IgG and IgA antibodies to C1q, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were found in less than 5% of the sera from RA patients and from healthy controls. In contrast, IgG and IgA antibodies to C1q were found in 29% and 61%, respectively, of the sera from patients with rheumatoid vasculitis. The occurrence of IgA antibodies to C1q has not been previously demonstrated. These results also demonstrate that IgG antibodies to C1q do not occur exclusively in systemic lupus erythematosus patients: Sera of patients with rheumatoid vasculitis frequently contain IgG or IgA antibodies to C1q, which contribute to immune complex formation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Rheumatoid factor (RF) testing by latex fixation in 8,287 outpatients yielded a sensitivity of 81.6% and 78.0% at titers of 1:20 and 1:80, respectively, and a specificity against noninflammatory rheumatic disorders (NIRD) of 96.6% and 97.9% and against NIRD plus inflammatory disorders of 95.2% and 96.8%, respectively. The predictive value of a positive test result at the clinic prevalence rate for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (16.4%) was approximately 80%, and was 70% at 10% prevalence and 10% at 1% prevalence. No associations of RF with age or sex were found in non-RA patients. RF titers increased minimally with age in RA patients and were higher in men than in women.

"Tumor necrosis factor production in HIV-seropositive subjects. Relationship with lung opportunistic infections and HIV expression in alveolar macrophages. We have evaluated the TNF production by alveolar macrophages (AM) in 43 HIV-infected subjects in relation with 1) their clinical and biologic status; 2) the presence of lung opportunistic infections (OI); and 3) the expression of HIV by AM. This production was assessed in a standard chromium release test, using monocytic U937 cells as targets. The spontaneous TNF production by AM from patients without lung OI was higher than that from seronegative controls (p less than 0.02). This production by AM was similar to that of blood monocytes, suggesting that it was not related, in these subjects, to any particular lung status. The extent of TNF release by AM was correlated to the presence of a lymphocytic alveolitis (p less than 0.05), and not to the patients' clinical presentation nor to their CD4 cell count. Finally, AM from these subjects could be normally stimulated in vitro by IFN-gamma. On the other hand, it appeared that the spontaneous TNF release by AM shown in vitro to express HIV (p24+ AM) was significantly higher than that by their p24- counterparts (p less than 0.05) and by controls (p less than 0.01). In addition, contrasting with the marked increase of TNF release by p24- AM after their stimulation with IFN-gamma (p less than 0.001), p24+ AM appeared to be refractory to any stimulation by IFN, arguing for their activation in vivo. Finally, the spontaneous TNF release by AM was significantly increased during lung OI, compared with controls (p less than 0.01) as well as with AIDS patients without OI (p less than 0.01). In addition, the production of TNF by AM in these subjects was higher than that by the corresponding blood monocytes (p less than 0.02), suggesting a compartmentalization of this response within the lungs. In conclusion, it appears that the TNF production by AM of seropositive patients is highly related to the presence of lung OI as well as to the expression of HIV by these cells. In the context of the up-regulation of HIV expression induced by TNF in vitro, our data could suggest that the in vivo release of TNF by AM could participate in viral dissemination. Moreover, we hypothesize that the generation of activated AM refractory to any further stimulation could in turn lead to the development of additional pulmonary infections.",Virus_Diseases
"Histopathologic features of the L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia-myalgia (fasciitis) syndrome  Study of 18 biopsy specimens in 11 patients with L-tryptophan-related eosinophiliamyalgia (fasciitis) syndrome showed hyaline sclerodermoid changes. Dermal scleroderma was found in eight of nine punch biopsy specimens and eight of nine excisional biopsy specimens. Fascial scleroderma was found in eight excisional biopsy specimens. One specimen obtained by excision had no fascia present. Eleven biopsy specimens showed edema of the dermis, and 13 showed dilated lymphatic structures; thus, the clinical picture of edematous sclerosis was confirmed. Mucinous fasciitis was present in five excisional biopsy specimens, in conjunction with a large number of macrophages in four. Dermal mucinosis was present in 11 biopsy specimens. Lymphocytic and macrophage inflammation was minimal in 14 biopsy specimens and pronounced in only 4. Plasma cells were present in eight cases. Eosinophils were present in substantial numbers in three biopsy specimens and only occasionally in four. Eosinophilic spongiosis was observed in one patient. Lymphocytic inflammation was noted around a single muscle spindle and around large nerve trunks in three patients. No relationship was established between these pathologic features and the duration or dose of tryptophan, prednisone treatment, or duration of symptoms.

"Kaposi's sarcoma of the colon in a young HIV-negative woman with Crohn's disease. We report a case of isolated colonic Kaposi's sarcoma in a 36-year-old HIV-negative woman with refractory Crohn's disease of the colon and perineum following 11 months' treatment with azathioprine. The clinical features of this case are quite different from those classically described in Kaposi's sarcoma. Among the known risk factors, iatrogenic immunosuppression would appear to be the most probable.",Virus_Diseases
"The effects of age and peripheral vascular disease on the circulatory and mechanical response of skin to loading. The skin and subcutaneous soft tissues of amputation residual limbs are required to withstand externally applied loads of greater magnitude than similar tissues of the intact lower limb. Increased age and poor circulatory status may contribute to the increased risk of tissue injury seen in this population. This study evaluates the effects of age and circulatory status as risk factors for skin injury resulting from externally applied forces. Twelve young control (YC), six elderly control (OC) and 11 subjects with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) were studied. After base-line ankle arm index (AAI) measurements, TcPO2 electrodes were applied 10 cm below the knee over the medial surface of the tibia and the muscle belly of tibialis anterior. TcPO2 measurements and tissue displacements were obtained under the influence of incremented, normally oriented, external loads. The sensitivity of the tissues to applied loads was determined by calculating the load at which the TcPO2 reached zero. The stiffness of the tissues (displacement/load) was calculated under high (greater than 40 mm Hg) and low (less than 20 mm Hg) loading conditions. No difference was noted in tissue sensitivity to applied loads between the OC and YC populations. The TcPO2 decreased to zero in the PVD population at significantly lower applied loads than both the OC and YC populations. The tissue stiffness of the PVD and the OC populations over bone was greater than the YC population, but no significant differences were noted between the PVD and the OC populations. In summary, increased age does not result in a greater tissue sensitivity to externally applied loads, in spite of the demonstrated increased tissue stiffness.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Pituitary hormones regulate c-myc and DNA synthesis in lymphoid tissue. Hypophysectomy of Fischer 344 rats of both sexes led to a rapid involution of the thymus and spleen which was associated with a profound decrease in spontaneous DNA synthesis in these organs. The proportion of B lymphocytes in the spleen, of T cells and their subsets (CD4+/CD8+) in spleen and thymus, and the histological structure of the involuted organs remained normal. Treatment of hypophysectomized animals with growth hormone (GH) or prolactin (PRL) stimulated the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene and DNA synthesis and reversed the involution in these organs. Replacement doses of adrenocorticotrophic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or thyroid-stimulating hormone had no influence on thymus or spleen size and DNA synthesis. A rapid expression of c-myc was also observed in thymuses and spleens of intact rats after the injection of GH or PRL. In vitro physiological concentrations (2.5 ng/ml) of either ovine or rat PRL or GH stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by thymus and spleen cells. These results indicate that GH and PRL regulate lymphocyte growth. This regulatory role is likely to serve as the principal mechanism of immunoregulation by these hormones.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Three hundred ninety-five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (mean age 49 years) were followed for an average of 6.7 years, and their baseline variables from the initial visit were examined for prediction of time to first fracture. Multivariate analyses identified use of corticosteroids in women and prior diagnosis of osteoporosis as important risk factors.

"Hepatitis C: prevention and treatment. Widespread screening of donor blood for hepatitis B led to the recognition that most cases of post-transfusion hepatitis were due to an agent or agents, collectively known as non-A, non-B. Until recently, the causative agent for non-A, non-B hepatitis was unknown. In 1988, a new agent, hepatitis C virus, was identified. It is estimated that 150,000 new cases of hepatitis C occur each year and that one-half of patients with hepatitis C develop chronic liver disease. Hepatitis C is responsible for 15,000 new cases of cirrhosis annually. In 1990, an antibody assay was approved for commercial use. Widespread screening of donor blood with this assay should reduce the risk of transfusion-associated hepatitis C. For those patients already infected, antiviral therapy with alpha interferon may offer the chance of cure or significant palliation.",Virus_Diseases

"Contact sensitization to 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MCI/MI). A European multicentre study. The frequency of positive reactions to 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MCI/MI) were studied at 22 European contact dermatitis clinics over a period of 1 year. A total of 4713 patients participated. All the patients were patch tested with nickel sulphate, formaldehyde, paraben-mix, and MCI/MI. 19.4% of the patients had positive patch tests to nickel, making this the most common allergen. 3% of the patients reacted to 100 ppm MCI/MI, while 2.6% reacted to formaldehyde and 1.1% to parabens. There was great variation in the frequency of MCI/MI sensitivity among the 22 centres. MCI/MI contact allergy was most common among women and in patients with facial dermatitis, while it was rarely seen in patients with dermatitis on the lower legs. There were no fluctuations in the number of positive patch tests to MCI/MI on a monthly basis when the results from all centres were combined. 117 of the 141 MCI/MI sensitized patients included in the study were retested. 88% had positive patch tests when retested. 101 of the MCI/MI-sensitive patients participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled product use test. This test showed that 31% of the MCI/MI-sensitive patients had a positive reaction to a MCI/MI-preserved product. Only a few patients reacted to a control product. It is concluded that the preservative MCI/MI is an important new contact allergen.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Localized pemphigoid shares the same target antigen as bullous pemphigoid. A case of localized pemphigoid is described in which the lesions were only on the lower legs. Immunoblotting of the patients' serum reacted with a 240-kDa polypeptide identical to one of the bullous pemphigoid antigens. IgG1 was detected in the lesional skin and IgG1 and IgG4 in the patient's serum. These observations suggest that the immunopathological mechanisms in the blister formation in localized pemphigoid are similar to those found in more widespread bullous pemphigoid.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Acute and chronic urticaria and angioedema. Urticaria and angioedema are clinical manifestations of various immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms, or they may be idiopathic. The respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as well as the cardiovascular system may be involved in any combination. Patients with urticaria and/or angioedema can be classified based on pathophysiologic mechanisms into those with IgE-dependent or complement-mediated immunologic disorders, those with nonimmunologic disorders in which there is a direct effect on the mast cell or on arachidonic acid metabolism, and those whose condition is idiopathic. Evaluation of patients should focus on a thorough history. Laboratory tests provide minimal additional information. About one half of patients with urticaria alone and 25% with urticaria and angioedema or angioedema alone are free of lesions within 1 year.

"Human type VII collagen: cDNA cloning and chromosomal mapping of the gene. A human keratinocyte cDNA expression library in bacteriophage lambda gt11 was screened with the purified IgG fraction of serum from a patient with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, which had a high titer of anti-type VII collagen antibodies. Screening of approximately 3 x 10(5) plaques identified 8 positive clones, the largest one (K-131) being approximately 1.9 kilobases in size. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing of K-131 indicated that it consisted of 1875 base pairs and contained an open reading frame coding for a putative N-terminal noncollagenous domain of 439 amino acids and a collagenous C-terminal segment of 186 amino acids. The collagenous domain was characterized by repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa sequences that were interrupted in several positions by insertions or deletions of 1-3 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence also revealed a peptide segment that had a high degree of identity with a published type VII collagen protein sequence. Northern hybridization of the K-131 cDNA with human epidermal keratinocyte and skin fibroblast RNA revealed an mRNA of approximately 8.5 kilobases. The fusion protein produced by the K-131 cDNA, when incubated with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita serum, bound to antibodies that reacted in Western blots with type VII collagen. The genomic location of the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) was determined by chromosomal in situ hybridization with the K-131 cDNA. The results mapped the COL7A1 to the locus 3p21. The cDNA clones characterized in this study will be valuable for understanding the protein structure and gene expression of type VII collagen present in anchoring fibrils and its aberrations in the dystrophic forms of heritable epidermolysis bullosa.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

We evaluated the time necessary to learn to do the test, and test performance using a reference panel and a seroconversion panel as well as 200 clinical specimens. Personnel who were previously unfamiliar with immunoassays learned the test procedure within 30 minutes. All reference specimens were interpreted correctly. One clinical sample reacted in the test but the result was not confirmed by Western blot.

"Mucosal immunity induced by enhance-potency inactivated and oral polio vaccines. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is recommended for routine immunization in the United States in part because of its ability to induce intestinal and pharyngeal immunity to reinfection. Mucosal immunity produced by OPV and enhanced-potency inactivated polio vaccine (E-IPV) was compared by challenging vaccines with type 1 OPV. Fewer OPV (25%) than E-IPV (63%) vaccinees excreted OPV virus in stool after challenge. The mean stool virus titer was higher and the duration of shedding longer among E-IPV excreters. Only one E-IPV and three OPV vaccinees shed virus in the pharynx after challenge. Prechallenge serum neutralizing antibody levels were not statistically different among E-IPV vaccinees who did and did not shed virus; these levels were much higher than those of OPV vaccinees. Poliovirus-specific IgA levels in stool did not correlate with viral excretion. E-IPV was less effective than OPV in preventing and limiting intestinal infection, even though it induced higher postvaccination serum antibody levels.",Virus_Diseases
"Heterosexual transmission of hepatitis delta virus in the general population of an area endemic for hepatitis B virus infection: a prospective study. A prospective study was conducted in 268 consecutive patients with overt hepatitis to examine the transmission of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in the general population of an area hyperendemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The patients were interviewed extensively for potential risk factors associated with transmission. Of the 203 patients with type B hepatitis, 34 (30 men, 4 women) showed serologic evidence of acute HDV infection (HDV+ group), while the other 169 did not (HDV- group). Of the 30 HDV+ men, 27 (90%) had had sexual intercourse with prostitutes within 3 months of admission, while only 31 (22.7%) of the 136 HDV- men, 8 (17.4%) of the 46 men with non-A, non-B hepatitis and 5 (8.3%) of the 60 control men had done so (P less than .001). Of the 4 HDV+ women, 1 was a prostitute and another was the wife of a patient with active HDV infection. There was no significant difference in exposure to other risk factors among these groups of patients. The results suggest that heterosexual exposure, particularly prostitute contact, is the most important route of HDV transmission in the general population of this area endemic for HBV infection.",Virus_Diseases

"FTZ-F1, a steroid hormone receptor-like protein implicated in the activation of fushi tarazu. The Drosophila homeobox segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) is expressed in a seven-stripe pattern during early embryogenesis. This characteristic pattern is largely specified by the zebra element located immediately upstream of the ftz transcriptional start site. The FTZ-F1 protein, one of multiple DNA binding factors that interacts with the zebra element, is implicated in the activation of ftz transcription, especially in stripes 1, 2, 3, and 6. An FTZ-F1 complementary DNA has been cloned by recognition site screening of a Drosophila expression library. The identity of the FTZ-F1 complementary DNA clone was confirmed by immunological cross-reaction with antibodies to FTZ-F1 and by sequence analysis of peptides from purified FTZ-F1 protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of FTZ-F1 revealed that the protein is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. This finding raises the possibility that a hormonal ligand affects the expression of a homeobox segmentation gene early in embryonic development.",Virus_Diseases
"Zidovudine in the management of primary HIV-1 infection. Eleven subjects who presented with a clinical illness characteristic of primary HIV-1 infection were treated with 1 g zidovudine daily for a median period of 56 days (range, 28-111 days). Primary HIV-1 infection was confirmed in each subject by seroconversion and virus isolation. The acute phase of the illness resolved a median of 4 days (range, 3-14 days) from commencement of zidovudine. Six subjects reported symptoms that may have been side-effects of zidovudine, the most common being nausea in four subjects and headache in two. Treatment was discontinued in one subject who had persistent headache and nausea. Haemoglobin, haematocrit and erythrocyte counts decreased and mean corpuscular volume increased significantly during the treatment. None of the subjects developed anaemia and none required dose modification or blood transfusion as a result of haematological side-effects. There were no significant differences in the granulocyte count or the lymphocyte count during any week of treatment when compared with baseline levels. There were no significant differences in T-cell subset numbers of the subjects during treatment compared with a group of historical controls. HIV-1 was isolated from several subjects during and after termination of zidovudine treatment. The results of this investigation indicate that zidovudine is a safe drug to administer to people with primary HIV-1 infection. There was no clear evidence, however, of any clinical benefit in terms of resolution of the acute illness and no indication that the treatment would prevent development of persistent infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Treatment of chronic liver disease caused by 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency with chenodeoxycholic acid. Deficiency of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase, the second enzyme in the sequence that catalyses the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, leads to chronic liver disease in childhood as well as to malabsorption of fat and fat soluble vitamins. A 4 year old boy with this condition has been successfully treated by oral administration of a bile acid--chenodeoxycholic acid. He had been jaundiced since birth, grew poorly because of rickets, and had severe pruritus. Plasma transaminase activities were persistently raised. Chenodeoxycholic acid 125 mg twice daily for two months, and then 125 mg daily, cured his jaundice and pruritus, returned his transaminase activities to normal, and eliminated the need for calcitriol for prevention of rickets. On this treatment he has so far remained well for two years. A diagnosis of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency should be considered in any child with unexplained chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, especially if the liver disease is accompanied by a clinically obvious malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins.

"Serum non-organ specific autoantibodies in human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection. Serum samples from 66 seropositive subjects (56 with a history of intravenous drug abuse), including asymptomatic carriers and patients with persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (PGL), AIDS related complex (ARC), and AIDS, were tested by indirect immunofluorescence on rat tissue sections and HEp-2 cells for the presence of antibodies to nuclei, smooth muscle, intermediate filaments (anti-IMF) and microfilaments (anti-MF). Counterimmunoelectrophoresis was also used to detect antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens. Smooth muscle antibodies with the V pattern or antinuclear antibodies, mainly of the speckled type, or anti-IMF, occurred in 35 cases, being widely distributed in all groups. Such an autoantibody response resembles the ""viral"" autoimmunity described in various infectious diseases and in particular that of non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis. Autoantibodies may be of some prognostic relevance, as the prevalence of smooth muscle antibodies V increased as the disease progressed (asymptomatic carriers 20%, those with PGL 29%, those with ARC 47%, and those with AIDS 63%. In the PGL group autoantibody positivity correlated with the presence of skin anergy. The fact that autoantibodies were more frequently detected in patients with circulating immune complexes suggests that these can contain autoantibodies and the corresponding autoantigens.",Virus_Diseases
"Posterior interosseous nerve palsies. One hundred seventy patients with radial nerve disorders were reviewed at the Louisiana State University Medical Center over a 15-year period. Of these, 32 had involvement of the posterior interosseous nerve exclusively. Findings included weak wrist extension with a radial drift, inability to extend the fingers, paralysis of thumb extension, and weak thumb abduction. Causes included entrapment at the arcade of Froshe (14 patients), laceration (6 patients), fracture (6 patients), compression or contusion (3 patients), and loss associated with tumor (3 patients). The ratio of men to women was 2:1, and the right arm was involved twice as often as the left. Preoperative evaluation included physical examination, electrophysiological testing (electromyogram/nerve conduction velocity), and roentgenograms of the elbow and forearm. Of the 30 patients (2 patients had bilateral lesions), 26 underwent operation. In the operative series, all 28 nerves had a function of Grade 3 or more of a possible 5 after 4 years of follow-up. Seventeen had achieved Grade 4/5, and 7 had obtained Grade 5/5. At operation, 23 nerves were found to be in continuity. Fourteen lesions of nerves in continuity were associated with entrapment and, not unexpectedly, transmitted a nerve action potential with slowed conduction and low amplitude across the lesion. Four nerves in continuity that had lesions caused by injury had nerve action potentials and were treated by neurolysis, and another 4 had no nerve action potentials and were treated by graft or suture repair. Five injured nerves were not in continuity. Two could be repaired by end-to-end suture, and 3 required graft repair.

"Immunodermatology update: the immunologically mediated vesiculobullous diseases. Before a specific diagnosis of an immunologically mediated blistering disease can be made, the clinical and histologic features and the results of direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies (with use of multiple substrates in some cases) must be assessed. For both subepidermal and intraepidermal groups of blistering diseases, direct immunofluorescence testing of perilesional tissue is critical for diagnosis. For these conditions, indirect immunofluorescence testing of serum is important for diagnosis and has a role in management of selected diseases. In dermatitis herpetiformis, indirect testing of serum for IgA antiendomysial antibodies is useful for both diagnosis and management. Indirect testing of serum for IgG antibodies to intercellular substance is important for diagnosis and, in conjunction with the clinical findings, can be used as a guide for monitoring disease activity in patients with pemphigus. Immunoelectron microscopy, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting studies have identified the sites of immune deposits and the specific antigens in most of the immunologically mediated bullous diseases.

"Influenza infection and diabetes mellitus. Case for annual vaccination. Herein, epidemiological data on influenza pneumonia and mortality, results of clinical studies, and the outcome of influenza vaccination trials are reviewed. All excess mortality studies that specify for underlying disease list diabetes as one of the major risk factors. During influenza epidemics, death rates among patients with diabetes mellitus may increase by 5-15%. Diabetes mellitus is also mentioned as a risk factor in most clinical studies, making up 3-14% of the patients studied. Even in recent studies, diabetes mellitus is only preceded as a risk factor by cardiovascular disease and chronic pulmonary disorders. To what extent cardiovascular disease and old age contribute to the increased influenza mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients remains unclear. The influence of epidemic influenza on the incidence of diabetic acidosis in combination with an impaired immune response to both Staphylococcus aureus and the influenza virus suggests that diabetes mellitus itself is the main risk factor.

"Disease-modifying agents and experimental treatments of rheumatoid arthritis. The pharmacologic management of the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient involves the use of various classes of therapeutic agents to induce symptomatic relief and reduce disease activity. Aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are used initially to lessen the degree of pain and swelling associated with the inflammatory disease process. The addition of a heterogeneous class of compounds, ""second-line"" therapy (previously known as disease-modifying antiinflammatory rheumatic drugs), is advocated to modify the disease course itself. Second-line treatments include antimalarials, gold salts, D-penicillamine, azathioprine, and methotrexate. Randomized placebo-controlled trials ahve demonstrated the efficacy of these compounds in RA. Improvement in standard parameters of disease activity including the number of painful and swollen joints, duration of morning stiffness, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate has been noted with these second-line drugs.

"Gamma globulin prophylaxis to reduce post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. A prospective, randomized study of immune serum globulin (ISG) for prevention of post-transfusion hepatitis was performed on 196 patients (100 controls without gammaglobulin or placebo and 96 who received ISG) undergoing valve replacement or coronary artery bypass with extracorporeal circulation. The dose of ISG was 2 ml i.m. at premedication and 2 ml i.m. on postoperative day 3. Probable non-A, non-B hepatitis developed postoperatively in ten of the 100 controls and two of the 96 in the ISG group. Two ISG patients and three controls with non-A, non-B hepatitis still have increased serum aminotransferase values after 3-5 years, but liver biopsy revealed hepatitis, which histologically was very mild, in only two control and two ISG patients.

This is a collective review of 564 patients with Marfan syndrome among 98 pedigrees reported from 18 provinces and cities in China over a 37-year period from 1951 to 1987. A positive family history of Marfan syndrome was found in 74.3% of the patients: the mode of inheritance was dominant in 73.8% and recessive in 0.5%. Sporadic cases occurred in 25.7%. A screening of 29,067 children found five children with Marfan syndrome, giving a prevalence of 17.2 per 100,000 of the population, a gene frequency of 8.61 per 100,000 genes, and a penetrance of 71.69%.

"Soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. To determine the role of T-cell activation in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), soluble IL-2R levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the sera of 30 patients with DH. Levels of this shed receptor are considered to be a measure of in vivo T-lymphocyte activation, and are elevated in the sera of many patients with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. Fifteen of the thirty (50%) patients with DH had elevated levels of soluble IL-2R compared to one of 31 (3%) healthy HLA-B8 or HLA-DR3 control subjects (p less than 0.00001) and one of 10 (10%) healthy non-HLA-B8/-DR3 subjects (p less than 0.0018). In addition, the mean soluble IL-2R level in the patients with DH (744 +/- 381 U/ml) was also significantly higher than that seen in 31 healthy HLA B8 or HLA DR3 individuals (388 +/- 160 U/ml, p = 0.0001) and 10 healthy non-HLA-B8/DR3 individuals (397 +/- 201 U/ml, p = 0.002). Only two of the 30 patients with DH had active skin lesions at the time of serum sampling, one of whom had elevated levels of IL-2R. Measurement of soluble IL-2R levels in sequential serum samples, available in four patients with DH at times of active and inactive skin disease, demonstrated a temporal association between soluble IL-2R level elevations and active skin disease in two patients and no association in two patients. In one patient a marked elevation in soluble IL-2R levels occurred with the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, which decreased by 14% with institution of a gluten-free diet. In order to determine if soluble IL-2R levels are related to the mucosal immune response, the IL-2R levels were compared to the level of IgA antibodies directed against the dietary antigen beta-lactoglobulin. Ten of eleven (91%) patients with circulating IgA anti-beta lactoglobulin antibodies were also found to have elevated levels of IL-2R. In contrast, in the patients with no detectable IgA anti-beta lactoglobulin antibodies, only four of 16 (25%) had elevated levels of IL-2R (p = 0.001). Because IL-2R levels are not related to activity of the skin disease in patients with DH but are associated with the presence of IgA antibodies against the dietary antigen beta-lactoglobulin, these results suggest that some of the T-cell activation commonly present in DH reflects an ongoing immune response in the gastrointestinal tract.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Human T lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) infection in a cohort of New York intravenous drug users: an old infection? To identify risk factors for human T lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) infection in intravenous drug users (IVDUs), participants in a longitudinal study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a New York methadone maintenance program were studied. Of 270 participants tested for HTLV-I/II, 21 (8%) were seropositive. Of those, 15 (71%) had HTLV-II-specific sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 1 (5%) had both HTLV-I- and -II-specific sequences; 3 persons with indeterminate serologic results were also PCR-positive for HTLV-II. HTLV-II infection was significantly associated with older age but was not predicted by sex, race, socioeconomic status, transfusion history, or HIV infection status. Behavioral factors since 1978, such as duration and frequency of intravenous drug use, needle sharing, visits to shooting galleries, or number of sex partners, were also not associated with HTLV-II infection. These findings are in contrast with the association of these risk factors with HIV in this group and suggest that, among IVDUs, HTLV-II is an older endemic infection that is less efficiently transmitted than HIV.",Virus_Diseases

"AIDS following mother-to-child transmission of HIV-2. Mother-to-child infection with HIV-2 is thought to be rare, and there have been few previous reports of transmission by this route. Reports of morbidity associated with HIV-2 infection in children are also rare. We describe eight children born to mothers who were infected with HIV-2; five developed AIDS, and three were still seropositive at 17-49 months of age. The only apparent route of HIV-2 transmission was from mother to child, except for one child who had been transfused. Three of the children with AIDS died, all having decreased CD4+ lymphocytes and mitogen responses. Further studies are needed to determine the prevalence and natural history of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-2.",Virus_Diseases
"Activation of collagen gene expression in keloids: co-localization of type I and VI collagen and transforming growth factor-beta 1 mRNA. Untreated, clinically active keloids were examined as model system to study the spatial expression of extracellular matrix and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) genes in fibrotic skin diseases. In situ hybridizations localized active expression of type I and VI collagen genes to the areas containing an abundance of fibroblasts and apparently representing the expanding border of the lesions. Within this zone, microvascular endothelial cells also expressed the type I collagen genes, as evaluated by simultaneous use of in situ hybridization for collagen gene expression and immunolocalization for factor VIII-related antigen, a marker for endothelial cell differentiation. Slot-blot hybridizations of RNA isolated from this zone suggested that the expression of type I and IV collagen genes was selectively enhanced, as compared to type III collagen gene expression. TGF-beta 1 protein and mRNA were also detected in areas active in type I and type VI collagen gene expression, indicating that TGF-beta 1 gene is transcribed and the corresponding protein is deposited in areas of elevated collagen gene expression, including microvascular endothelial cells. We conclude that the initial step in the development of fibrotic reaction in keloids involves the expression of the TGF-beta 1 gene by the neovascular endothelial cells, thus activating the adjacent fibroblasts to express markedly elevated levels of TGF-beta 1, as well as type I and VI collagen genes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The role of antihistamines in the treatment of chronic urticaria. For many years, H1 antihistamines have been the primary management option for urticaria. However, undesirable side effects, particularly daytime sedation, have limited the usefulness of these classic antihistamines. A new class of peripherally acting, nonsedating antihistamines (e.g., terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and cetirizine) has proved to have clinical efficacy comparable with the classic antihistamines. In comparative trials between the various nonsedating agents, no significant difference in efficacy has been noted. All these agents have good safety profiles, although astemizole use has been correlated with increased appetite and weight gain in some patients, and cetirizine has caused slightly increased sedative effects compared with placebo. Although H1/H2 antihistamine combinations have been proposed as possible treatments for urticaria, studies have produced mixed results.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Evidence for an epidermal cytokine network. Cytokines are (glyco)proteins that are synthesized and secreted by various cells, which bind to specific receptors on target cells and which regulate activation, proliferation, and differentiation of immune as well as non-immune cells. Keratinocytes upon injury release interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, colony-stimulating factors, and tumor-necrosis factor, as well as growth and suppressor factors. There is also strong evidence for a network of interacting cytokines, which has been only partially characterized so far, maintaining a proper balance. However, excessive or insufficient production of these mediators may contribute to certain disease states, particularly those with infectious and autoimmune genesis. Therefore the understanding of cytokine interactions may be helpful in elucidating the pathomechanisms of such diseases. Moreover, certain cytokines, as well as their analogues and antagonists, may prove to be of therapeutic value.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Incidence of psoriasis in Rochester, Minn, 1980-1983. This population-based study was carried out using the medical records linkage data resource for the population of Rochester, Minn, at Mayo Clinic. There were 132 newly diagnosed cases of psoriasis identified during a 4-year period (1980 through 1983); 88% of the cases had been seen and diagnosed by a dermatologist. The overall crude incidence rate was 57.6 per 100,000 population; for men and women, the rates were 54.4 and 60.2, respectively. The overall sex- and age-adjusted (1980 US white population) incidence rate was 60.4 per 100,000 person-years. The highest rate of occurrence (112.6) was in the 60- to 69-year-old age group. Most of the cases of psoriasis diagnosed in this study (58%) were mild, and the patients had psoriatic lesions on less than 10% of their body.

"Intestinal mucosal permeability in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. I. Role of antiinflammatory drugs. Using the 51Cr-EDTA resorption test, gut permeability was measured in 129 patients with inflammatory joint diseases and in 97 control patients (42 patients with no inflammatory rheumatic disorders taking antiinflammatory medication and 55 healthy controls). Thirty-two patients (30 arthritis and 2 control patients) taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) as well as corticosteroids were excluded from statistical analysis. The intake of NSAID significantly increased gut permeability in controls but not in the arthritis groups. The same applied to corticosteroid intake. This could be due to the restricted number of arthritis patients who had never taken antiinflammatory drugs or to a disease related increased permeability. There was no statistically significant difference in altered gut permeability between patients taking NSAID and patients taking corticosteroids. Our findings suggest that drug induced alteration of gut permeability may not only be accounted for by an inhibition of mucosal cyclooxygenase activity, but that other enzymatic pathways in the arachidonic cascade might be implicated.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Detection of hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid in the serum by amplification with polymerase chain reaction. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was detected in the sera of patients with non-A, non-B chronic liver disease by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RNA was extracted from the serum, reverse transcribed to cDNA, and amplified by PCR. With this method, 30 patients with non-A, non-B chronic liver disease and 10 healthy subjects were tested. HCV RNA was detected in 13 of 16 (81%) anti-HCV-positive patients and also in 7 of 14 (50%) anti-HCV-negative patients, but in none of 10 anti-HCV-negative healthy subjects. Specificity of this method was confirmed by direct sequencing of amplified cDNA segment. The nucleotide sequences (37 nucleotides) obtained from 15 patients showed only 68-78% homology compared with the prototype HCV nucleotide sequence. In addition, of 15 nucleotide sequences, there were 12 different types. But the translated amino acid sequences (12 amino acids) showed 83-100% homology compared with the prototype HCV amino acid sequence. These data suggest the majority of anti-HCV-positive patients are carriers of HCV. But to detect all the viremic patients, the anti-HCV antibody testing may be insufficient. Direct detection of HCV RNA may be useful in the study of virus replication and its association with various liver diseases.",Virus_Diseases

"Interferon alpha-2b injections used as an adjuvant therapy to carbon dioxide laser vaporization of recalcitrant ano-genital condylomata acuminata. We retrospectively analyzed our treatment of men with anogenital condylomata acuminata (CA) at Hennepin County Medical Center and the University of Minnesota. Between October 1985 and August 1989, 48 patients with CA were treated with laser vaporization, and 27 were treated with laser vaporization followed by a series of intralesional interferon (IFN) alpha-2b injections. The patients in the IFN group were more likely to have perianal CA (44% vs 24%), had larger numbers of CA, and were more likely to have had previous treatment, including previous laser vaporization. The CA in the laser group were more likely to be on the penis alone (67% vs 45%) and had a longer mean duration. The laser-treated group experienced a 38.2% rate of recurrence or reinfection with a mean follow-up period of 13 weeks. The laser and IFN group had an 18.5% rate of recurrence or reinfection with the same follow-up. We conclude that intralesional injections of alpha-2b interferon following carbon dioxide laser vaporization of recalcitrant ano-genital condylomata substantially reduce the risk of recurrence or reinfection.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect HIV-1 sequences (gag, pol, and env) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 53 HIV-1-positive patients and the results correlated with clinical evidence of neurological disease. Twenty-three out of 24 patients with neurological disease had HIV-1-specific sequences in CSF compared with four out of 20 asymptomatic patients who had no evidence of neurological involvement. The detection of HIV RNA sequences by PCR in the CSF of HIV-positive patients may provide early, rapid and direct evidence of neurological involvement in asymptomatic subjects.",Virus_Diseases
"HLA-D region antigens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We studied the distribution of HLA-D region antigens in 2 groups of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients: those with mild, nonprogressive disease, and those with severe disease. The results demonstrate that DR4 was significantly increased in both RA patient populations. The frequencies of DR1 and DR4-associated DQw7 alleles, however, were different in these 2 groups of patients. DR1 was significantly increased only in patients with mild RA, and DR4-associated DQw7 was significantly increased only in patients with severe disease. The results of the present study, together with previous data from our laboratory and from other investigators on the incidence of HLA-D region antigens in RA, suggest that both DR and DQ (A and B) genes may be important in conferring susceptibility to RA; DR in the mild forms of the disease, and DQ in severe RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Pharmacologic therapy for urticaria. Treatment of chronic urticaria presents a challenge to both practitioner and patient. Traditional H1 antagonists with good efficacy but substantial side effects are being supplanted in many cases by nonsedating H1 antagonists such as terfenadine and astemizole. Antidepressant medications and combinations of H1 and H2 antagonists offer improved results for selected patients. Further development and investigation of mast cell stabilizers and inhibitors of urticaria mediators other than histamine hold promise. A better understanding of the underlying pathogenesis remains the greatest hope of formulating rational and effective therapy.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Response of mononuclear cells from HIV-infected patients to B-cell mitogens: correlation with immunological and clinical features of disease progression. Proliferation of mononuclear cells from HIV-seropositive patients to B-cell mitogens was studied in the absence and presence of mixed lymphocyte culture supernatants (MLC-sup). The results show: (1) patients' responses to B-cell mitogens overlap with normal responses but are, on average, consistently lower than normal; (2) the addition of MLC-sup increases the proliferative responses to T-cell-independent mitogens, but does not bring patient's responses up to control levels; (3) HIV-positive patients in all clinical categories have decreased responses to B-cell mitogens. Although some patients with AIDS Centers for Disease Control (CDC) group IVC and IVD have the lowest responses, asymptomatic (CDC group II) and AIDS-related complex (ARC; CDC groups III/IVA and IVB) patients also show significant defects. (4) The same patients were recategorized using an immunological staging system. Those patients with more normal immunohematological parameters have significantly greater responses to mitogens compared with patients with more abnormal immunological parameters. The data suggest that immunological staging could provide more information than clinical classification with respect to the underlying immunopathogenic events occurring in HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases

"Early ribavirin treatment of respiratory syncytial viral infection in high-risk children. A 3-year prospective, blinded, multicenter study was done to assess the efficacy of early ribavirin intervention in mild respiratory syncytial virus illness in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or with congenital heart disease. A cohort of 178 children younger than 36 months of age with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease were followed. Forty-seven infants whose respiratory syncytial virus infection resulted in mild symptoms of less than or equal to 72 hours' duration received ribavirin (n = 20) or water placebo aerosol (n = 27) either in a hospital or at home. Outcome measures included respiratory and analog score, room air oxygen, saturation, and oxygen flow needed to maintain saturation at greater than or equal to 91%. No difference in age, gender, family size, passive smoking, baseline oxygen saturations in room air, or duration of symptoms before treatment was found between groups. After 3 days of therapy, ribavirin produced a greater rate of improvement of analog scores (p = less than or equal to 0.001), lower oxygen requirements (p = 0.01), and higher oxygen saturation (p = 0.01). Respiratory scores and total hospital days did not differ significantly between the groups. Treatment failure occurred in 2 of 20 children (10%) in the ribavirin group versus 5 of 27 children (18%) in the placebo group, a nonsignificant difference. No child required assisted ventilation or had an adverse reaction. We conclude that early ribavirin therapy may help to reduce morbidity from respiratory syncytial virus infection in high-risk young children.",Virus_Diseases

"Modulation of monocyte chemotactic function in inflammatory lesions. Role of inflammatory mediators. Monocyte recruitment and accumulation in the synovial tissue is pivotal in the evolution of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the present study we examined the chemotactic potential of monocytes obtained from synovial fluid (SF) of patients with RA. Functionally, SF monocytes exhibited greatly diminished chemotactic activity to C5a compared with monocytes from the peripheral blood. In contrast, their chemotactic responsiveness to the synthetic peptide, FMLP, was nearly normal. To define a mechanism for this differential chemotactic dysfunction, cell-surface receptors for C5a (C5aR) and FMLP (FMLP-R) were evaluated. Whereas FMLP-R expression was similar on both blood and inflammatory monocytes, C5aR expression was markedly reduced on SF cells. Because decreased C5a binding in certain RA SF samples could not be attributed to free C5a, known or suspected components of inflammatory SF were evaluated for their ability to modulate chemotactic ligand receptors. Bacterial products including LPS and streptococcal cell walls, which are potent monocyte activators, down-regulated C5aR without affecting FMLP-R. Moreover, the cytokines IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF selectively decreased C5aR in parallel with decreased in vitro chemotactic activity to C5a. Thus, these data indicate that 1) synovial effusions may contain C5a and/or inflammatory mediators that modulate phenotypic and functional changes in monocytes, 2) chemotactic ligand receptors are independently regulated in inflammatory lesions, and 3) decreased C5aR expression and chemotactic potential likely provide a mechanism whereby monocyte-macrophages persist within the inflamed synovium.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Axillary granular parakeratosis. The term axillary granular parakeratosis is proposed for a unique axillary eruption with distinct histopathologic features. Four middle-aged to elderly patients (three women, one man) had unilateral or bilateral, usually pruritic, hyperpigmented to bright red patches in the axillae. Biopsy specimens revealed severe compact parakeratosis with the stratum corneum measuring 80 to 250 microns in maximal thickness, maintenance of the stratum granulosum, remarkable retention of keratohyaline granules throughout the stratum corneum, and vascular proliferation and ectasia. A contact reaction to an antiperspirant/deodorant is suspected as the cause. We speculate that the offending agent alters the maturation sequence of the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum, possibly by interfering with the degradation of filaggrin precursor to filaggrin units.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"High doses of recombinant alpha-interferon or gamma-interferon for chronic hepatitis C: a randomized, controlled trial. Chronic hepatitis C is often a progressive liver disease for which there is no satisfactory treatment. We studied the efficacy of recombinant alpha-interferon or gamma-interferon in the treatment of this disease in comparison with a control group. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to three groups. Ten patients received 7.5 MU alpha-interferon/m2 body surface three times weekly for 3 mo, then 5 MU/m2 for 3 mo and 2.5 MU/m2 for 6 mo. Ten patients were treated with gamma-interferon at a dose of 2 MU/m2 for 6 mo and the other 10 served as controls without treatment. The mean serum ALT levels and liver histological findings improved significantly only in the patients treated with alpha-interferon. No changes were observed in patients treated with gamma-interferon or in controls. Five of 10 patients treated with alpha-interferon had complete responses (mean ALT normal during therapy). After treatment ALT returned to pretreatment levels in two of 5 patients. The long-term response rate after alpha-interferon therapy was 30% at 18 mo. We conclude that alpha-interferon is effective in controlling disease activity in a portion of patients with chronic hepatitis C. High doses of alpha-interferon do not appear to add further benefit in the response rate or relapse rate. gamma-Interferon therapy is ineffective.",Virus_Diseases
"Clinical, laboratory and radiographic features in early rheumatoid arthritis. We evaluated disease status in relation to age, sex and disease duration using some short term indices of disease activity, laboratory tests, and radiological features in 315 patients with rheumatoid arthritis of duration varying from 3 to 36 months (mean 12 months). No differences were observed among various age groups in disease duration, female/male ratio, incidence of radiologic lesions and other indices of disease process. Some clinical markers of the disease process such as involvement of the flexor tendons of the hands and Ritchie's index (score greater than 9) were significantly more frequent in the women (p less than 0.0013 and p less than 0.04, respectively). In the patients with disease of recent onset women were slightly more numerous (56%) than men; however, in those with disease duration of 36 months there were significantly more women (72%) (p less than 0.039), suggesting a greater tendency to chronic disease in this sex. Radiological lesions of the small joints of the hands, feet, and/or wrists were found in 37% of the cases with disease duration of up to 4 months and in 91% at 36 months (p less than 0.0001). The lesions were associated significantly more frequently with Ritchie index (p less than 0.02) and with laboratory indices of inflammatory activity (erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 25 mm/h) (p less than 0.001) and immune response (latex test greater than or equal to 80) (p less than 0.0001).

Lymphotoxin was localized in the epithelium and connective tissues of the cholesteatomas studied. The epithelium of normal external ear canal skin was lightly stained, but the stain was much weaker than that of the cholesteatomas.

"Risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection among sexual and nonsexual household contacts of persons with congenital clotting disorders. The status of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection at the time of transmission to sexual contacts remains poorly defined. Transmission to nonsexual household contacts has appeared to be rare. A total of 505 sexual and nonsexual contacts of HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs in 349 households was observed. At entry, 10% of 201 sexual partners were anti-HIV-1-positive. Follow-up of 151 uninfected partners during a total of 351 person-years of observation showed no sero-conversions, although there were 13 pregnancies during that period. Eighty-seven percent of the seronegative respondents to a detailed questionnaire reported unprotected sexual contact at least occasionally. Among 304 other household members, including 108 parents who helped administer clotting factor concentrates to their children, none was seropositive at entry. Follow-up of 263 showed no seroconversions during a total of 605 person-years of observation. Thus, anti-HIV-1-positive hemophiliacs transmitted to their partners earlier in their course but were not found to do so when prospectively observed. No relationship to level of viremia as indicated by CD4 count, HIV-1 p24 antigenemia, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was found. Anti-HIV-1-positive hemophiliacs had not transmitted to their nonsexual household contacts before study entry and did not do so subsequently, indicating that the risk from even close nonsexual contact is extremely low.",Virus_Diseases

"Serologic discrimination of human T cell lymphotropic virus infection by using a synthetic peptide-based enzyme immunoassay. Synthetic peptides corresponding with unique regions of the envelope glycoproteins (gp46) of human T cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) were used in an enzyme immunoassay to determine if HTLV-I and -II infections could be discriminated. Two synthetic HTLV-I sequence-derived peptides, Env-1 (amino acids 191-215) and Env-5 (amino acids 242-257), reacted with 92% and 100% of the serum specimens (n = 52) from HTLV-I-infected persons, respectively. Although a small percentage (8.6%) of serum specimens from persons infected with HTLV-II cross-reacted with Env-1, none of these specimens reacted with Env-5. Peptide Env-2 encoded by the envelope region of HTLV-II (amino acids 187-210) reacted with serum specimens from both HTLV-I (94%)- and HTLV-II (74%)-infected patients, whereas Env-6, another HTLV-II peptide (amino acids 238-254), reacted with less than 6% of the specimens. Therefore, the Env-5 peptide with amino acid sequence SerProAsnValSerValProSerSerSerSerThrProLeuLeuTyr represents an immunodominant domain of HTLV-I that is recognized by serum antibodies from all HTLV-I-infected persons. Moreover, the Env-5-based ELISA allows a categorical distinction between the closely related HTLV-I and -II infections.",Virus_Diseases

Abbott, Coulter, and Du Pont antigen kits were used to test 661 sera collected sequentially from 65 members of the Toronto Sexual Contact Study (TSCS). The sera had been collected at 3-month intervals over 4 years from nine persistently HIV-seronegative men, 14 seroconverters, and 42 seroprevalent participants. Antigen was not detected in any seronegative men. Two of 14 seroconverters were antigen positive in the specimen immediately preceding seroconversion (by all kits).

Discrepancies were noted in the time of detection of antigen (ranging from 3 months to more than 3 years) in nine participants. Although overall concordance among all kits for all specimens appears high (95.4%), when the bias introduced by testing multiple specimens from the same patient is removed, the lower bound of concordance among all three kits is estimated to be 80%.

"Monoclonal antibodies detect monocyte/macrophage activation and differentiation antigens and identify functionally distinct subpopulations of human rheumatoid synovial tissue macrophages. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to functionally heterogeneous populations of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue macrophages and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated U937 cells were generated. These MAbs were used to characterize macrophages in situ in the synovial pannus and to study relative antigen expression on the surface of cells isolated from the synovium and from normal peripheral blood. Monoclonal antibody 3D8, an anti-CD13 MAb, reacts with an antigen expressed on the surface of blood monocytes and is a monocyte activation-related antigen that is upregulated by exposure of monocytes to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and LPS. The expression of the 3D8 antigen increases in parallel with MHC class II antigen expression and also is upregulated in culture as monocytes mature to macrophages. 3D8 antigen is expressed strongly on RA synovial tissue lining cells, which are thought to be composed of macrophages. 8D7 antigen expression, detected by MAb 8D7, increases on blood monocytes on cellular activation with LPS and interferon-gamma, but in contrast to the 3D8 antigen, does not increase with monocyte maturation in vitro.

Therefore maternal immune function was assessed with the use of in vitro techniques. Transient and incomplete suppression of the proliferative response to the T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin was demonstrated as early as 24 hours after administration of betamethasone. The magnitude and duration of suppression showed a corresponding increase with advancing gestational age, but these effects were not cumulative and were always short-lived (less than 72 hours). No such suppression of the B-cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide was detected. The nonspecific cellular resistance to infection of maternal monocytes was determined through coincubation with the facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Increased phagocytic activity with a normal bactericidal effect was measured in the cell preparations obtained from recipients versus nonrecipients of betamethasone. Taken together, these findings clearly show that both specific and nonspecific immune function are intact in the preterm gravid woman after administration of betamethasone and should allay concerns over its use for reasons of infection control alone.",Virus_Diseases
Isolated incisional metastases after intraperitoneal radioactive chromic phosphate therapy for ovarian carcinoma. Two women developed apparently isolated recurrences of ovarian carcinoma involving prior incisions after receiving intraperitoneal radioactive chromic phosphate (P-32) adjuvant therapy for early epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Both are alive without evidence of disease at second-look laparotomy after surgical resection of the abdominal wall metastases and cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Mechanisms of cutaneous and incisional implantation metastases are discussed. Adjuvant therapy with intraperitoneal P-32 is unable to provide systemic therapy for occult metastatic disease. The favorable outcome in these cases probably reflects limited tumor burden at the time of recurrence and stands in stark contrast to other cases of soft tissue recurrences of ovarian carcinoma reported previously.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Safety of alcohol after viral hepatitis. To test the validity of the generally held belief that moderate consumption of alcohol during convalescence from acute viral hepatitis adversely affects outcome, 87 adults recovering from acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis A in 36, hepatitis B in 34, hepatitis non-A, non-B in 17) were studied. Criteria for entry to the study attempted to ensure that no patient was a chronic hepatitis B carrier. Patients were randomised either to a moderate alcohol intake, or to continued complete abstention. Drinkers consumed 26 g alcohol daily (mean) and none remained abstinent. At 3 months all patients were well, with normal liver function tests. There were no significant differences between the two groups at anytime. The findings suggest that moderate alcohol intake during convalescence from acute viral hepatitis does not seem to be harmful.",Virus_Diseases
"Risk factors for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in rural northern Senegal. The extent of infection among 722 residents of an enzootic focus of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus in rural northern Senegal and putative modes of transmission were studied by a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey done from February through May 1989. Anti-CCHF virus IgG was found in 13.1% of 283 persons who completed a standard questionnaire and provided blood samples. Seropositivity rates were similar between sexes and increased significantly with age among nomadic persons. Behavior patterns providing exposure to multifactorial risk factors were gender-based. Male risk factors, primarily associated with herding activities, included sleeping outside during seasonal migrations (also a risk factor for nomadic women), bite by a tick (adult male Hyalomma truncatum), tick bite during the cool dry season, and contact with sick animals. Human infection of CCHF occurred more frequently or with less mortality in the region studied than has been found elsewhere in Africa; however, the rate of seroconversion-associated illness is undetermined. Hyalomma ticks appear to be the primary transmission mode.",Virus_Diseases
"Antiidiotypic responses to immunization with anti-Leu 3a in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive individuals. Anti-idiotypic antibodies to anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been reported to bind to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein gp120. To establish whether HIV-infected patients can mount an anti-idiotypic response to murine MAb, four individuals with symptoms of AIDS-related complex (ARC) were immunized over 10 weeks with six intramuscular injections of anti-Leu 3a (1 mg). Despite their immunocompromised state, all patients made anti-constant region and anti-idiotypic antibodies, although the amplitude of the responses varied between individuals. No significant toxic or allergic reactions were seen, and there were no changes in clinical status during the 6 months after immunization. No increase in serum HIV-neutralization titers was seen, and purified anti-idiotypic antibodies did not bind gp120.",Virus_Diseases

While fever is almost universal, older patients with the disease often present without lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, splenomegaly, lymphocytosis or atypical lymphocytes. Jaundice and hepatomegaly occur more commonly in older patients than in adolescents and create diagnostic confusion. Often, infectious mononucleosis in this age group is confused with lymphoma, leukemia or biliary obstruction, or is classified as ""fever of unknown origin."".",Virus_Diseases
"Reliable confirmation and quantitation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody using a recombinant-antigen immunoblot assay. The recombinant DNA-derived, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen-based immunoblot assay (RIBA-HIV216) is a new supplemental (confirmatory) test developed to detect antibodies to HIV-1. The assay employs four recombinant viral antigens, corresponding to HIV-1 p24, p31, p41 and gp120 proteins, in an immunoblot format. With this assay, HIV-1 antigen reactivity was detected in all 683 infected patient serum or plasma specimens evaluated; 665 (97.6%) of these sera met the criteria for a positive interpretation, and 18 (2.6%) were classified as indeterminate. All 683 samples reacted with the recombinant gp41-equivalent protein. The first sequential enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-reactive samples collected from 33 seroconverting homosexual men reacted on RIBA-HIV216. Eleven (1.1%) of 999 EIA-negative blood donor sera reacted weakly with a single recombinant antigen (p24 or p31), whereas 13 to 48 percent had indeterminate reactions on viral lysate Western blots. One (1.5%) of 66 EIA-positive, Western blot-negative blood donor samples and 19 (29%) of 66 EIA-positive, Western blot-indeterminate blood donor samples scored indeterminate on RIBA-HIV216. Nonspecific reactivity was seen with only 1 (0.8%) of 114 patient sera containing possible interfering antibodies, whereas 33 percent of these samples had indeterminate reactions on Western blot and 35 percent had equivocal reactions on immunofluorescence assay (IFA). We conclude that the RIBA-HIV216 is approximately as sensitive as and significantly more specific than virus-derived Western blot and IFA. The RIBA-HIV216 also allows for semiquantitation of specific antibodies that may be of value in clinical staging and therapeutic monitoring.",Virus_Diseases
"Ultrasound B scanning with image analysis for assessment of allergic patch test reactions. Assessment of patch test results has been performed visually and using ultrasound in the B mode. A positive test site has a typical ultrasonographic appearance, presenting a uniform hypoechogenic area in the dermis. In this zone, the mean amplitude of ultrasound reflection peaks decreases, and the extension of this area increases, together with the intensity of the eczematous reaction. A close correlation has been shown between visual scoring, amplitude decrease and surface increase of the hypoechogenic area.

"A virus-encoded ""superantigen"" in a retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome of mice. The development of an immunodeficiency syndrome of mice caused by a replication-defective murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is paradoxically associated with a rapid activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells that are dependent on the presence of B cells. The responses of normal spleen cells to B cell lines that express the defective virus indicated that these lines express a cell surface determinant that shares ""superantigenic"" properties with some microbial antigens and Mls-like self antigens. This antigen elicited a potent proliferative response that was dependent on the presence of CD4+ T cells and was associated with selective expansion of cells bearing V beta 5. This response was markedly inhibited by a monoclonal antibody specific for the MuLV gag-encoded p30 antigen.",Virus_Diseases
"Histological study of white blood cells and their association with lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulceration. The number of white blood cells per mm2 has been determined in serial histological slides taken from punch biopsies of skin from the goiter region in patients with varicose veins. In eight patients the varicose veins were complicated by lipodermatosclerosis of the skin, and in a further six there was a history of ulceration. In uncomplicated varicose veins there was a median of 6 white blood cells per mm2, in patients with lipodermatosclerosis there were 45 white blood cells per mm2, and where there was a history of ulceration, 217 white blood cells per mm2. No change in white blood cell content was observed after the venous pressure was raised for 30 min by sitting the patient with the lower limb dependent.

"Treatment of aggressive keratoacanthomas by radiotherapy. Keratoacanthomas infrequently are treated by radiotherapy. However, keratoacanthomas that are recurrent after surgical excision or whose resection would result in cosmetic deformity may benefit from radiotherapy. Between January 1970 and June 1988, 29 such keratoacanthomas in 18 patients were irradiated. Doses ranged from 3500 cGy in 15 fractions to 5600 cGy in 28 fractions. Measured end points of therapy were (1) initial response, (2) freedom from recurrence, and (3) quality of the subsequent cosmetic appearance (scored as good, fair, or poor). No lesion progressed and all eventually regressed completely. Cosmetic results generally were considered good by both the patient and the referring dermatologist; none of the results was considered poor. Our results demonstrate that radiation is an effective means of treating keratoacanthomas.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Topical podofilox for the treatment of condylomata acuminata in women. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of 0.5% podofilox solution (Condylox) for the treatment of genital warts in women. Thirty-seven women with anogenital warts applied the solution to the surface of these warts twice daily for 3 days, followed by 4 drug-free days. A minimum of two and a maximum of four treatment cycles were given. The subjects were evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks and again at 6 and 10 weeks. At the end of 10 weeks, the mean number of warts per patient was reduced from 6.27 to 1.1, and half of the patients were completely cleared of warts. Only eight of 37 subjects (21.6%) developed new warts during the study period. Approximately 15% of patients reported ""severe"" local reactions to the treatment after the first treatment cycle, but this was reduced to only 5% by the last treatment cycle. During the same period, the patients reporting no side effects increased from 44 to 86%. The only woman who discontinued the study did so because of dizziness and epigastric discomfort, probably unrelated to drug use. Thus, 0.5% podofilox solution appears to be an effective treatment for condylomata acuminata, with acceptable side effects that are local and temporary.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Antibody to Coxsackie B virus in diagnosing postviral fatigue syndrome  OBJECTIVE--To study the association between coxsackie B virus infection and the postviral fatigue syndrome and to assess the immunological abnormalities associated with the syndrome. DESIGN--Case-control study of patients with the postviral fatigue syndrome referred by local general practitioners over one year. SETTING--General practitioner referrals in Dunbartonshire, Scotland. PATIENTS--254 Patients referred with the postviral fatigue syndrome (exhaustion, myalgia, and other symptoms referable to postviral fatigue syndrome of fairly recent onset--that is, several months) and age and sex matched controls obtained from same general practitioner; 11 patients were rejected because of wrong diagnoses, resolution of symptoms, and refusal to participate, leaving 243 patients and matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Detailed questionnaire (patients and controls) and clinical examination (patients) and blind analysis of blood sample at entry and after six months for determination of coxsackie B virus IgM and IgG antibodies and other variables (including lymphocyte protein synthesis, lymphocyte subsets, and immune complexes). RESULTS--Percentage positive rates for coxsackie B virus IgM at entry were 24.4% for patients and 22.6% for controls and for coxsackie B virus IgG 56.2% and 55.3% respectively; there were no significant differences between different categories of patients according to clinical likelihood of the syndrome nor any predictive value in a fourfold rise or fall in the coxsackie B virus IgG titre in patients between entry and review at six months. The rates of positive antibody test results in patients and controls showed a strong seasonal variation. Of the numerous immunological tests performed, only a few detected significant abnormalities; in particular the mean value for immune complex concentration was much higher in 35 patients and 35 controls compared with the normal range and mean value for total IgM was also raised in 227 patients and 35 controls compared with the normal range. CONCLUSIONS--Serological tests available for detecting coxsackie B virus antibodies do not help diagnose the postviral fatigue syndrome. Percentage positive rates of the antibodies in patients simply reflect the background in the population as probably do the raised concentrations of total IgM and immune complexes.",Virus_Diseases
"Controlling HIV in Africa: effectiveness and cost of an intervention in a high-frequency STD transmitter core group. Since 1985, a population of over 1,000 predominantly HIV-positive female prostitutes residing in a low-income area of Nairobi, has been enrolled in a sexually transmitted disease (STD)/HIV control programme. The major elements of the programme include the diagnosis and treatment of conventional STD, and the promotion of condom use to prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Using estimates of numbers of HIV-seropositive prostitutes, numbers of sexual contacts, susceptibility of clients to HIV, HIV transmission efficiency, rates of condom use and the basic reproductive rate of HIV infection in Kenya, we estimate that the programme is responsible for preventing between 6,000 and 10,000 new cases of HIV infection per year among clients and contacts of clients. The total annual operating cost of the programme is approximately US$77,000 or between US$8.00 and US$12.00 for each case of HIV infection prevented. Programmes to reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections which are targeted at high-frequency STD transmitters, such as prostitutes, can be effective and relatively inexpensive to undertake. More such programmes should be developed and evaluated in different settings.",Virus_Diseases
"Early and specific diagnosis of seropositivity to HIVs by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using env-derived synthetic peptides. We describe and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a 22-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the carboxy-terminal end of HIV-1 gp120 and two 30-amino-acid long cyclic peptides including the two vicinal cysteines present on HIV-1 gp41 and on HIV-2 gp36. This test was evaluated. Data obtained with the Western blot (WB) and the peptide-based ELISA on a first panel composed of sera from 547 patients attending a specialized outpatient clinic (high-risk population) are in perfect agreement; moreover, 39 samples that had falsely been found positive with a viral lysate-based ELISA were not detected by peptide-based ELISA. The second panel was composed of 309 sera which were difficult to resolve using both WB and viral lysate-based ELISA. Using the peptide-based ELISA, 134 were found clearly positive and 173 clearly negative; only two were falsely positive. Finally, sera from 16 individuals examined at the time of seroconversion gave high absorbancy readings even if they were weakly reactive by WB (weak gp160 band). This test is thus highly sensitive and specific, and capable of detecting early seroconversion. It is also instrumental in clearly defining samples that are found indeterminate in the WB, and consequently it avoids the unnecessary follow-up required when a false-positive result is obtained using viral lysate-based ELISA.",Virus_Diseases
"Oestrogen and androgen states in oligo-amenorrhoeic women with polycystic ovaries. Oestrogen and androgen states have been studied in relation to ovarian morphology defined by ultrasonography in 65 women with oligo-amenorrhoea. Of the 48 women with polycystic ovaries (PCO), 44 (92%) had a withdrawal bleed following progestogen challenge (indicating oestrogenization) compared with just three (18%) of the 17 with non-PCO (P less than 0.001). Median serum concentrations of oestradiol and oestrone were statistically significantly higher in the PCO group but the ranges overlapped widely. Of the four women with PCO but oestrogen deficiency, two were hirsute and had evidence of a severe form of the disorder. The other two were not hirsute and appeared to have hypothalamic dysfunction associated with weight loss overriding the disorder due to pre-existing PCO. Compared with the non-PCO group, the PCO subgroup without hirsutism (n = 31) had statistically significantly higher median values of LH, testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate concentrations, and free androgen index. Concentrations of androgen, but not LH, were significantly higher still in the PCO subgroup with hirsutism (n = 17).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"From Papanicolaou to Bethesda: the rationale for a new cervical cytologic classification. The Bethesda System for reporting cervical/vaginal diagnoses was introduced to replace the numerical Papanicolaou class designations, thereby facilitating precise communication between cytopathologist and clinician. The terminology for squamous epithelial lesions includes the following categories: 1) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; 2) squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), which encompasses the spectrum of squamous cell carcinoma precursors, divided into low-grade SIL (human papillomavirus [HPV]-associated cellular changes, mild dysplasia, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] I) and high-grade SIL (moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ and CIN II and III); and 3) squamous cell carcinoma. The rationale for including HPV-related changes (koilocytosis) with CIN I within low-grade SIL is based on the morphologic, behavioral, and virologic similarity of these two lesions, which precludes their separation in a consistent and reliable fashion. For the same reasons, CIN II and III lesions have been combined within the category of high-grade SIL. The term ""atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance"" is used for cytologic findings that do not fulfill the criteria for defined benign reactive changes or SIL. Therefore, this term is more restricted in usage as compared with the wide range of interpretations previously ascribed to ""atypia"" or ""inflammatory atypia."".",Virus_Diseases

Eighteen of them were from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (18 of 250), 2 from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (2 of 115), and 8 from patients with mixed connective tissue disease (8 of 10). Antigenic material for this antibody is resistant to DNase, partially sensitive to RNase, and sensitive to trypsin. This indicates that the antigen is composed of protein and possibly RNA. In immunoblot analysis, sera positive for this antibody in indirect immunofluorescence assay recognized different peptides. This suggests that protein peptides are the major antigenic material.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Polarized light examination and photography of the skin. Light reflected from skin has two components: regular reflectance, or ""glare"" arising from the surface, and light backscattered from within the tissue. The regular reflectance contains the visual cues related to surface texture, whereas the backscattered component contains the cues related to pigmentation, erythema, infiltrates, vessels, and other intracutaneous structures. Unlike the backscattered component, regular reflectance preserves the plane of polarization of polarized incident light. Thus, viewing skin through a linear polarizer, under linearly polarized illumination, separates the two components of tissue reflectance. Thirty patients were examined and photographed in this manner. When the planes of polarization are parallel, images with enhanced surface detail are obtained. When the planes are orthogonal, wrinkles and surface detail disappear, and an enhanced view of vasculature and pigmented lesions is obtained. Simple, clinically useful techniques are presented.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Effect of sodium lauryl sulfate-induced skin irritation on in vitro percutaneous absorption of four drugs. The influence of irritant contact dermatitis on percutaneous penetration was investigated for four 14C-labeled compounds with diverse physicochemical properties: hydrocortisone (HC), indomethacin (IM), ibuprofen (IB), and acitretin (AC). Hairless guinea pigs were pretreated in vivo for 24 h with either 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) to induce irritant contact dermatitis or with water (controls). Twenty-four hours after pretreatment animals were sacrificed. Percutaneous penetration was then measured using in vitro diffusion cells and the removed (pretreated) skin. The following parameters were determined: cumulative amount of compound penetrated, steady state flux, lag time, and permeability coefficient, skin concentration per unit area, and the relative amount of drug remaining in the skin (as a percentage of the cumulative amount of compound penetrated through the skin). SLS pretreatment resulted in moderate irritant dermatitis in all animals and increased in vivo transepidermal water loss 4.5 times. Flux was increased in SLS-pretreated skin as compared with controls for all four compounds, with the greatest enhancement for hydrocortisone (HC) (5.9 times), followed by indomethacin (IM) (4.6 times), ibuprofen (IB) (3.9 times), and acitretin (AC) (3.4 times). Skin concentrations increased to a smaller degree from 1.6 times (IB) and 2.6 times (HC) to 3.4 times (IM). However, AC skin concentrations were not different between the two groups. Thus, percutaneous penetration parameters were equivocally influenced by SLS-induced irritation.

"Prolactin and gonadal hormones during pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus. We performed prospective hormonal studies in 9 patients (5 active and 4 inactive) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) during pregnancy (Weeks 10 to 37). Nine healthy pregnant women and 5 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were used for comparison. Serum prolactin (PRL), testosterone and estradiol (E2) levels were determined by RIA. The patients with SLE showed higher serum PRL levels, the difference being statistically significant at Week 20, and reaching the highest levels at Weeks 30 to 40 (p = 0.05 when compared to healthy pregnant women). The 5 patients with active SLE had the highest serum PRL levels; one of these had fetal wastage. In active SLE the serum testosterone and E2 levels were decreased significantly from Weeks 10 to 30 compared with controls (p = 0.001). In patients with RA serum PRL levels, although higher than in controls, did not differ significantly, nor did the lower testosterone and E2 levels. We conclude that gonadal hormones and PRL changes observed in SLE are present also during pregnancy and may be related to fetal wastage and reactivation of disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Synthesis of collagen types I and III in reincised wounds in humans. The problem of the biochemical quantification of long term human wound healing was approached by measuring collagen synthesis in reincisions using specific radioimmunoassays for the wound fluid concentrations of the carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) and the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP). First-day wound fluid PICP concentration after reincising a 3 week old scar was 25 times higher than the mean value in 20 reference standard incisions but scars older than 3 months did not show this difference. Wound fluid taken in subsequent days demonstrated that the initial acceleration of synthesis disappeared by the fourth day. When wound fluid PIIINP was assessed, high concentrations were found in reincisions of wounds for up to 5 months after the previous operation. The acceleration was also lost more slowly during the first postoperative week. The duration of a high rate of type I collagen synthesis compares well with studies in experimental wounds which show increased gain of strength if they are made not more than 6 weeks after previous surgery. The longer activity of the metabolism of type III collagen related antigens could reflect their function in the regulation of collagen fibril formation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia of the hand. A case report. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is an uncommon benign vascular neoplasm manifested by multiple or solitary subcutaneous nodules, usually on or about the head of young adults. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is characterized microscopically by marked proliferation of large endothelial cells with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils. This benign skin disorder may resemble an angiosarcoma both clinically and histologically. We wish to report a patient with angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia on the palm of the hand and discuss therapeutic recommendations.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Rasmussen encephalitis: epilepsia partialis continua secondary to chronic encephalitis. Rasmussen encephalitis is a disease consisting of chronic encephalitis with progressive neurologic deficits and focal intractable seizure activity. The etiology is unknown, but pathologic specimens revealed changes consistent with viral encephalitis. Even though neuro-imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, offer the prospect of specific, presurgical diagnostic criteria, the initial diagnosis usually is made on a clinical basis. Treatment modalities, including a wide variety of antiepileptic drug therapies and surgical interventions, may result in significant physical and mental impairments. We summarize the clinical presentation, diagnostic considerations, and different treatment protocols in a patient with this rare and debilitating disorder.",Virus_Diseases
"Rapid detection of Epstein-Barr viral DNA by nonisotopic in situ hybridization. Correlation with the polymerase chain reaction. A nonisotopic, in situ hybridization procedure is described for detecting Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA in cytopreparations of pepsin-digested, unfixed cells in less than 3 hours. The procedure, which uses an EBV Bam HI W DNA probe conjugated directly to horseradish peroxidase, first was optimized using an EBV-infected cell line (ARH-77) and then validated on four positive control specimens and six negative control specimens. Optimization studies demonstrated distinct nuclear hybridization signal in less than 10% of formaldehyde-fixed, pepsin-digested ARH-77 cells. When formaldehyde fixation was omitted, more than 50% of the pepsin-digested ARH-77 cells had strong nuclear staining. Unfixed cells from the four positive controls had detectable hybridization signal; the presence of EBV-DNA in these specimens also was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction. There was no hybridization signal in the six negative control specimens. The results indicate that this nonisotopic, in situ hybridization procedure rapidly detects the presence of EBV-DNA in cytopreparations of unfixed, pepsin-digested cells from clinical specimens. There is a tradeoff, however, between assay sensitivity and preservation of cytologic details.",Virus_Diseases
"Susceptibility to and severity of rheumatoid arthritis in multicase families. Fifteen sibships, each having two or more siblings affected by classical or definite RA were studied. They comprised 31 patients with RA (all in remission) and 21 normal siblings. The total severity index of RA was assessed by clinical and radiological indices. For all the patients the following investigations were carried out: (1) HLA antigens determination for nine antigens at A locus and 15 at B locus and 6 at DR locus; (2) rheumatoid factor. We found: (1) RA disease is genetically controlled and the responsible genes are linked to the HLA system; (2) association between seropositivity and DR4 and DR4/B27 genotypes; (3) significant effect of the genotype DR4/B27 on the age of onset; (4) association between the increase in disease severity both clinical and radiological and DR4/X and DR4/B27 phenotypes. Thus the genetic control is probably composed of two types of genes: disease susceptibility genes and disease severity genes linked to DR4/X and DR4/B27 phenotypes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Clinical correlations and prognosis based on hyaluronic acid serum levels in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis. The serum levels of hyaluronic acid (sHA) were measured using an affinoimmunoenzymatic assay in patients with distal (n = 16) and proximal (n = 15) progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) and in 31 controls. The severity of PSS was evaluated using a standardized organ-involvement score. The mean sHA was significantly higher in the patients with PSS than in controls (mean +/- SD:80 +/- 43.4 micrograms/l vs. 42.3 +/- 19.1 micrograms/l, P less than 0.001). sHA was significantly higher in patients with proximal PSS than in patients with distal PSS (106.4 +/- 44.6 micrograms/l vs. 55.4 +/- 23.8 micrograms/l, P less than 0.001). A positive correlation was found between sHA and the disease score (r = 0.67, P less than 0.001). sHA was also correlated with lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (r = 0.70, P less than 0.001), but only in the those patients who had abnormal lung function, and therefore presumably had lung PSS involvement. We suggest that sHA could be an indicator of the degree of systemic involvement in PSS. Its prognostic value and possible use in the follow up of patients with PSS remain to be clarified.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The development and use of Patient Knowledge Questionnaire in rheumatoid arthritis. A multi-choice Patient Knowledge Questionnaire (PKQ) was developed for use with patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Test/re-test was used to test its stability (r = 0.81), and Kuder Richardson formula 20 (r = 0.72) for internal consistency. Seventy randomly selected RA patients then completed the PKQ in a rheumatology out-patient clinic of a large teaching hospital. There was a wide variation in total scores ranging from 3 to 28 out of 30. Total scores correlated with years of general education (P less than 0.05) but not with disease duration or age. Sixty-two per cent of patients knew that the cause of RA is, as yet, unknown but 27% thought it could be caused by injury and 11% by cold damp weather. Fifty-two per cent had no idea why they had blood tests. All but four patients were taking some form of medication but there was widespread confusion about disease-modifying drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Exercise was reasonably well understood but many patients were unable to differentiate between methods of energy conservation and joint protection. This study highlights the need for careful individual knowledge assessment by use of tools such as the PKQ and effective patient education programmes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Enhanced production of neutrophil-activating peptide-1/interleukin-8 in rheumatoid arthritis. Production of the neutrophil-activating peptide (NAP)-1/IL-8 by mononuclear phagocytes from patients with RA and from control subjects was studied under various conditions. Mononuclear cells from bone marrow (BMMC), PBMC, and synovial fluid (SFMC) were cultured for up to 48 h in the absence or presence of Escherichia coli LPS, different interleukins, interferon-gamma, zymosan, or immune complexes, and the neutrophil-stimulating activity released into the culture medium was determined. As shown by neutralization with an antiserum raised against human recombinant NAP-1/IL-8, over 90% of this activity could be attributed to NAP-1/IL-8. In unstimulated mononuclear cells from control individuals and BMMC from RA patients, the production of NAP-1/IL-8 was very low and was enhanced moderately by stimulation with LPS. By contrast, the spontaneous production of NAP-1/IL-8 was 3- to 10-fold higher in PBMC and even much higher in SFMC from RA patients. In all instances, the yield of NAP-1/IL-8 could be enhanced by stimulation in culture. In addition to LPS, rheumatoid factor-containing immune complexes, zymosan, and IL-1 were highly effective in inducing NAP-1/IL-8 production, while IL-3, GM-CSF, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and IL-2 were somewhat less potent. An inhibitory effect was obtained with IFN-gamma, which significantly decreased the spontaneous NAP-1/IL-8 release from SFMC and the IL-1- and LPS-induced NAP-1/IL-8 from RA and control PBMC. Inhibition was also observed with glucocorticoids. The production of NAP-1/IL-8 was markedly reduced by dexamethasone in phagocytosis-stimulated PBMC, and almost totally inhibited in SFMC obtained from joints after intraarticular administration of betamethasone. By contrast, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, tended to increase the NAP-1/IL-8 yield from PBMC in culture.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
The ethics of pressure sore prevention and treatment in the elderly: a practical approach. The management of pressure sores in elderly patients raises a number of ethical dilemmas for health care professionals. Aggressive treatment of advanced pressure sores is often inconsistent with the overall goals of therapy. Private and public funding for effective prevention and early treatment are restricted and constrained. Little information is available that proves treatment efficacy. Health care professionals and their institutions are often stigmatized by the occurrence of a pressure sore even though accountabilities may lie in the natural history of the disease. We use case analysis to identify ethical dilemmas in pressure sore prevention and management and suggest a framework for ethical decisionmaking so that health care professionals and public policy analysts can make informed judgments about patients and standards of quality care.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Magnitude and duration of UV-B-induced tolerance. Using repeated minimal erythema dose (MED) testing, we investigated the magnitude and duration of tolerance to short-wave UV radiation in the B range (UV-B) in 37 patients with psoriasis who received at least 12 UV-B phototherapy treatments. Without substantial erythema developing, half of the patients received UV-B doses in excess of 13 times their pretreatment MED dose and a fourth received UV-B doses in excess of 28 times their pretreatment MED dose. On average, tolerance faded to about half that present at the last UV-B treatment in 3 weeks. Six weeks after therapy was stopped, most posttreatment MEDs were less than twice the pretreatment MED. The magnitude of tolerance achieved and the rate of decay did not vary with skin type. Our findings indicate that repeated exposures to suberythemal or mildly erythematous doses of UV-B can induce exceptional degrees of tolerance to UV-B radiation. The duration of this increase in tolerance is, however, short.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Suppression of herpes simplex virus type 1 reactivation from latency by (+-)-9-([(Z)-2-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexyl]methyl) guanine (L-653,180) in vitro. Latent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection was induced in human embryonic lung cells in vitro by using a combination of viral replication inhibitors and elevated temperature. Under reactivating conditions (superinfection by human cytomegalovirus or temperature manipulation), a nonantiviral thymidine kinase inhibitor (L-653,180) was found to suppress or delay reactivation of HSV-1 from latently infected human embryonic lung cells. L-653,180 alone or in combination with interferon was ineffective as a primary or acute viral replication inhibitor and was unable to induce latent HSV-1 infection in cell culture. These data suggest that initial or acute virus replication and replication resulting from reactivation from latency are separate events.",Virus_Diseases
"Structural features of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis. Most studies of lung histology in systemic sclerosis have been based on autopsy specimens and consequently emphasize end-stage fibrotic disease. Although occasional pathologic descriptions of open-lung biopsies have recognized the presence of inflammatory cells, suggesting a similarity to ""lone"" cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, the two conditions have never been formally compared. In this study we describe the morphologic features of 49 open-lung biopsies from 34 systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease, many of whom had their lung disease diagnosed at an early stage. None had pulmonary hypertension. Examination of lung tissue by light microscopy showed the earliest changes to include patchy lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration of the alveolar walls, interstitial fibrosis, and increased macrophages but only occasional polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes in the alveolar spaces. Alveolitis was not observed without fibrosis. Comparison of 22 biopsies with a similar number from patients with lone cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, matched for age and sex, revealed no qualitative or quantitative differences, other than a higher prevalence of focal lymphoid hyperplasia (follicular bronchiolitis) in the systemic sclerosis patients than in the lone cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis controls (23 and 5%, respectively). There was an inverse correlation between the extent of interstitial inflammation and patients' age (p less than 0.05), disease duration (p less than 0.05), and age at onset of systemic sclerosis (p less than 0.01). There was also an inverse correlation between DLCO and interstitial fibrosis (p less than 0.01) and loss of lung architecture (p less than 0.05). Ultrastructural studies of eight systemic sclerosis biopsies showed evidence of endothelial and epithelial injury together with interstitial edema and excess collagen deposition. Occasional mast cells were observed, often in close contact with interstitial fibroblasts, but there were no tubuloreticular structures or evidence of immune complexes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Rheumatoid factors and complex formation. The role of light-chain framework sequences and glycosylation. New information regarding rheumatoid factors (RFs) indicates that the RFs synthesized in synovium and lymphoid tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are different from monoclonal and nonspecific RFs associated with other inflammatory states. The characteristics of RF associated with RA are as follows. They are of all Ig isotypes (not just IgM), indicating T-cell participation in antibody maturation. They have higher avidity for human IgG than for rabbit IgG. They use the human germline heavy-chain variable region (VH) gene VHIII more frequently than other VH genes, and light chains from multiple families. (In contrast, monoclonal RFs use predominantly VH1 and very commonly the V kappa IIIb germline gene HUMkv325). RA IgG is somatically mutated. (In contrast, monoclonal RFs use unmutated germline Ig genes). This suggests they are matured by stimulation either with specific antigens or other activation signals such as cytokines. They are abnormally glycosylated. In general, during periods of disease activity in adult and juvenile RA, a galactose is missing from the Fc of the IgG molecule, leaving an empty ""pocket"" between the C gamma 2 domains of heavy chains. The IgG RFs self-associate. This may result at least in part when galactose on the F(ab')2 portion of one IgG molecule fills the empty pocket in the Fc of another Ig molecule. Self-association forms immune complexes capable of fixing complement and probably of causing joint damage and vasculitis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Detection of cross-reactive idiotypes in the serum of patients with bullous pemphigoid. To further characterize the circulating antibasement membrane zone (antiBMZ) antibodies present in the sera of patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), we have generated a mouse monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody (antiId 3-17) specific for an IgG antiBMZ antibody. AntiId 3-17 is specific for an idiotype expressed on antiBMZ IgG in the serum of a patient with BP, and not expressed on pooled normal human IgG or IgG from patients with other autoimmune skin diseases. AntiId 3-17 binds to non-reduced, but not reduced, antiBMZ IgG on immunoblot, suggesting that the idiotype is composed of a conformational epitope expressed on native antibody. By a competitive inhibition ELISA, antiId 3-17 detects a cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) expressed in 18 of 50 (36%) of the sera of patients with BP, but in the sera of only 1 of 50 (2%) normal blood bank controls (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test) and 1 of 12 (8%) patients with pemphigus (p = 0.005). Thus, antiId 3-17 recognizes a public idiotype on a native antiBMZ antibody from a patient with BP, which is expressed in the sera of 36% of the unrelated patients with BP studied.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Pityriasis lichenoides in children: a long-term follow-up of eighty-nine cases. Pityriasis lichenoides is usually classified into an acute and a chronic form. From a review of 89 cases of the disease seen since 1974 it seems that a more realistic classification into three main groups, according to the distribution of pityriasis lichenoides lesions, could be made, namely, a diffuse, a central, and a peripheral form, each characterized by a different clinical course. Conversely, no correlations were detected in our series between the severity of skin lesions and their distribution or the overall course of the disease. None of our cases suggests the possible evolution of pityriasis lichenoides into lymphomatoid papulosis. Although no infectious causative agent has been identified, a viral origin seems likely in some cases. Most patients responded favorably to UVB irradiation. Our conclusions are (1) that pityriasis lichenoides is probably a clinical disorder with a diverse etiology and (2) that its classification by distribution seems more useful than its subdivision into an acute and a chronic form.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evidence for susceptibility of intrathymic T-cell precursors and their progeny carrying T-cell antigen receptor phenotypes TCR alpha beta + and TCR gamma delta + to human immunodeficiency virus infection: a mechanism for CD4+ (T4) lymphocyte depletion. Individuals infected by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) demonstrate progressive depletion and qualitative dysfunction of the helper T4 (CD4+) cell population. Mechanisms proposed for attrition of CD4+ T cells include direct cytopathicity of these mature cells following infection as well as infection of early T-lymphocyte progenitors. The latter mechanism could lead to failure to regenerate mature functioning CD4+ T cells. The present study determines the susceptibility of thymocytes at various stages of maturity to infection with HIV-1. Various normal thymocyte populations were inoculated with HIV-1, including unfractionated (UF), CD3- CD4- CD8- [""triple negative"" (TN)], CD4+ CD8+ [""double positive"" (DP)] thymocytes, and thymocyte populations obtained by limited dilution cloning. Cultures were studied for the presence of HIV-1 DNA by polymerase chain reaction in addition to examination for reverse transcriptase activity. We determined that transformed T-cell and thymocyte cell lines completely lacking CD4 were not susceptible to infection by HIV-1, whereas all of the following lines were: UF thymocytes (70-90% CD4hi+); DP thymocytes (99% CD4hi+); TN thymocytes (0% CD4hi+); and TCR alpha beta +, TCR gamma delta +, or CD16+ CD3- (natural killer) thymocyte clones expressing variable levels of CD4 and representing the progeny of TN thymocytes. [TCR alpha beta + and TCR gamma delta + refer to the chains of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), and CD4hi refers to a strong rightward shift (greater than 30 linear channels) of the CD4 curve on flow cytometric analysis compared with control.] Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD4 (T4a epitope) but not to CD3 (T3) were capable of blocking infection of mature and immature CD4hi+ thymocytes. Moreover, anti-CD4(T4a) mAbs also inhibited infection of CD4hi- TN thymocytes, indicating that these T-cell precursors--despite their apparent ""triple negativity"" (CD3- CD4hi- CD8-)--expressed sufficient CD4 molecules to become infected. Cell sorter analysis with a panel of CD4 mAbs demonstrated a mean shift of the mean fluorescence channel (MFC) with CD4 mAbs on TN thymocytes of 6 +/- 4 MFC units. Thus, intrathymic T-cell precursors and their progeny representing many stages of T-cell ontogeny are susceptible to infection by HIV-1, including early TN thymocytes, which express very low levels of CD4. Infection of multiple stages and multiple subsets of the T-cell lineage in man, mediated via the CD4 molecule, may explain the inability of the T-cell pool to regenerate in the setting of progressive HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases

"American blood donors seropositive for human T-lymphotropic virus types I/II exhibit normal lymphocyte subsets. Recent reports have demonstrated that some lymphocyte subsets are abnormal in Japanese blood donors who are seropositive for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). To determine if similar changes characterize American blood donors who are seropositive for HTLV-I/II, lymphocyte subsets were measured in 42 HTLV-seropositive and 42 HTLV-seronegative blood donors. The seronegative individuals were matched by age, race, and gender to the seropositive individuals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with a panel of 12 monoclonal antibody pairs and then analyzed by two-color flow cytometry. No significant differences were observed between the seropositive and seronegative groups with respect to the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes or the percentages of lymphocytes belonging to the subsets assessed. These subsets included B, T, CD4, and CD8 cells and subpopulations of CD4 and CD8 cells defined by the coexpression of markers that appear (CD25, HLA-DR, CD38) or disappear (Leu 8, CD45RA) after activation. These findings indicate that HTLV-seropositive persons in the American blood donor pool do not exhibit the lymphocyte subset alterations reported for HTLV-I-seropositive blood donors in Japan.",Virus_Diseases
"The induction of epidermal ornithine decarboxylase following tape stripping is inhibited by a topical vitamin D3 analogue (MC903). The efficacy of MC903, a vitamin D3 analogue, in reducing hyperproliferation as determined by levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was investigated in a double-blind study of 15 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The lesions of psoriasis were treated for 8 weeks with MC903 in one of two different cream bases or with a placebo cream. Biopsies were taken before and after treatment. In addition an uninvolved area of skin was treated during the last 3 weeks and this as well as control areas were then sellotape stripped and biopsied after 8 h. Clinical improvement was seen in eight out of 11 patients treated with MC903 but there was no reduction in the level of ODC in psoriatic lesions after 8 weeks of treatment. The levels of ODC in the tape-stripped uninvolved skin after 3 weeks of treatment with MC903 averaged 22.5 +/- 4.2 pmol/min/mg protein as compared to 58.6 +/- 12.6 pmol/min/mg protein (P = 0.004).

"Marfan syndrome caused by a recurrent de novo missense mutation in the fibrillin gene  Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder of connective tissue manifested in the ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular systems. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant with high penetrance, but has great clinical variability. Linkage studies have mapped the Marfan locus to chromosome 15q15-21.3. There have been no reports of genetic heterogeneity in the syndrome. Following the identification of fibrillin (a glycoprotein component of the extracellular microfibril), immunohistopathological quantification of the protein in skin and fibroblast culture, and examination of fibrillin synthesis, extracellular transport, and incorporation into the extracellular matrix (D. M. Milewicz, R.E.P., E. S. Crawford and P. H. Byers, manuscript in preparation) have demonstrated abnormalities of fibrillin metabolism in most patients. A portion of the complementary DNA encoding fibrillin has been cloned and mapped by in situ hybridization to chromosome 15. Here we report that the fibrillin gene is linked to the Marfan phenotype (theta = 0.00; logarithm of the odds (lod) = 3.9) and describe a de novo missense mutation in the fibrillin gene in two patients with sporadic disease. We thus implicate fibrillin as the protein defective in patients with the Marfan syndrome.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Waterborne outbreak of Norwalk virus gastroenteritis at a southwest US resort: role of geological formations in contamination of well water. From April 17 to May 1, 1989, gastroenteritis developed in about 900 people during a visit to a new resort in Arizona, USA. Of 240 guests surveyed, 110 had a gastrointestinal illness that was significantly associated with the drinking of tap water from the resort's well (relative risk = 16.1, 95% confidence interval 14.5 to 17.8) and this risk increased significantly with the number of glasses of water consumed (p less than 0.005). Three of seven paired sera tested for antibodies to the Norwalk agent had a four-fold or greater rise in titre. Water contaminated with faecal coliforms was traced back to the deep water well, which remained contaminated even after prolonged pumping. Effluent from the resort's sewage treatment facility seeped through fractures in the subsurface rock (with little filtration) directly into the resort's deep well. Although the latest technology was used to design the resort's water and sewage treatment plants, the region's unique geological conditions posed unexpected problems that may trouble developers faced with similar subsurface geological formations and arid climatic conditions in many parts of the world. In these areas, novel solutions are needed to provide adequate facilities for the treatment of sewage and supply of pure drinking water.",Virus_Diseases

The extent of itch, assessed by a score, was not significantly different between HD and CAPD patients. Plasma histamine levels showed no significant difference between CAPD and HD patients and no correlation between plasma histamine level and the extent of pruritus could be demonstrated. In six patients on CAPD and 9 patients on HD plasma histamine levels were determined before and three months after initiation of dialysis treatment; no substantial change could be observed.

The frequency, duration, and titre of virus isolation from the vaccination site and occurrence of local side-effects were similar between the two groups of vaccinees. Vaccinia-naive (vac-n) subjects shed virus from the vaccination site for longer and at a higher titre than did vaccinia-primed (vac-p) individuals (19 vs 7 days and 10(7) vs 10(5) pfu/ml, respectively). In-vitro T-cell proliferative responses to one or more HIV antigen preparations developed in 13 of 16 vaccinia-primed subjects inoculated with HIVAC-1e. T-cell responses were, however, transient and in no subject did antibodies to HIV become detectable. The 2 vaccinia-naive subjects vaccinated with HIVAC-1e showed strong T-cell responses to homologous and heterologous strains of whole virus and to recombinant gp160 protein that remained detectable for over a year; antibodies to HIV envelope also developed in both.

"Increased interleukin-2 production in response to human type I collagen stimulation in patients with systemic sclerosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) produced increased amounts of interleukin-2 (IL-2), in a dose-dependent manner, in response to stimulation with human type I collagen, whereas PBMC from normal subjects did not. At a dose of 50 micrograms human type I collagen/10(6) PBMC, PBMC from SSc patients (n = 17) produced 8 times as much IL-2 as did PBMC from 16 normal subjects (P less than 0.005) and 3 times as much as did PBMC from a group of 13 rheumatoid arthritis patients (P less than 0.05). In contrast, IL-2 production by PBMC after nonspecific stimulation with the mitogen, phytohemagglutinin, did not differ among the SSc, rheumatoid arthritis, and normal control groups. Cell depletion experiments indicated that the IL-2-producing cells in SSc patients are CD4+. Thus, SSc patients have CD4 cells that are specifically sensitized to human type I collagen and can produce increased levels of IL-2. Measurement of IL-2 production stimulated by human type I collagen may be useful in evaluating disease activity, and further investigation of this process may contribute to the delineation of the pathogenesis of SSc.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Membranous lipodystrophy: primary idiopathic type. A 20-year-old woman had a pea-sized, tender subcutaneous nodule on the leg. Histopathologically, the panniculus showed multiple microcysts lined by membranes and light brown granules in the histiocytes. Histochemical studies of the membranes of the microcysts and the granules in the histiocytes indicated that they were composed of ceroid. Electron microscopy revealed that the membrane of the microcyst was composed of electron-dense areas of a regular 18.6 nm lamellar array and reticulated vacuolated areas suggestive of degenerating fat cells of unknown origin. Membranous lipodystrophy has been associated with many local and systemic diseases, but it may be idiopathic, as in our patient.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Clinical significance of antibodies to a 68 kDa U1RNP polypeptide in connective tissue disease. In a series of 163 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or systemic sclerosis and/or mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), the presence of antibodies to a 68 kDa U1RNP associated polypeptide was more predictive for SLE (88%) than for MCTD (38-68%) using 3 different sets of proposed criteria for the latter condition. In all but one case studied serially the immunoblotting profile remained constant. In SLE recognition of the 68 kDa polypeptide identified a subset with increased vasoreactivity with Raynaud's phenomenon (96%, p less than 0.001) and swollen fingers (68%, p less than 0.001) whereas recognition of a 47 kDa La (SSB) polypeptide was associated with photosensitivity (72%, p less than 0.02), less renal involvement (p less than 0.05) and an older age of disease onset (46.6 years +/- 18.3 SD, p less than 0.002).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Structural aberration of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and melanosome compartmentalization in long-term cultures of melanocytes from vitiligo patients. Long-term cultures of melanocytes were established from 14 subjects with vitiligo and from five normal controls and analyzed ultrastructurally. Cultured melanocytes from 78.6% of the vitiligo patients demonstrated abnormalities that consisted of 1) dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), 2) circular RER profiles, and/or 3) membrane bound compartments of melanosomes. Cultured melanocytes from control subjects were predominantly normal with only one of the normal cultures demonstrating minimal circular RER profiles. The three unique abnormal structures in cultured vitiligo melanocytes were not always concomitantly expressed and could not be associated with any specific clinical feature of vitiligo. Quantitative analysis of the RER demonstrated that the profiles of dilated RER in cultured vitiligo melanocytes expressed a significant 1.5-2.8-times increase in mean cisternal area over cultured control melanocytes (i.e., 5.41-9.92 microns 2 versus 3.53 microns 2, respectively). The cisterna of the dilated RER profiles frequently contained floccular material that appeared to originate from the ribosomes, an indication that the floccular material may be translation products. The dilation of RER in melanocytes from the same patient persisted through repeated subculturing for up to 14.75 months. Epidermal melanocytes in biopsied skin from a patient whose cultured melanocytes were aberrant also demonstrated dilated and circular RER profiles. These results demonstrate that melanocytes from most vitiligo patients express an innate defect when cultured. Although this defect does not appear to be cytotoxic in vitro, this abnormality may be the primary defect that elicits melanocyte destruction in vivo.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Ankle arthrodesis with vertical Steinmann's pins in rheumatoid arthritis. Many techniques for ankle arthrodesis have been described but some of them are not applicable in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have also developed osteopenia and decreased bone density. A technique utilizing two longitudinally placed Steinmann's pins to fixate and align the joint was used in five patients with severe RA and is described here. Results showed a 100% fusion rate and patient satisfaction over an average follow-up time of six years. This ankle arthrodesis technique was found to be applicable in arthritic patients with osteopenia and decreased bone density caused by RA.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Abnormal single motor unit behavior in the upper motor neuron syndrome. We studied the discharge pattern of single motor units (SMUs) in the left and right biceps muscles from a patient with nonspastic weakness of the left arm. Detailed statistical analysis of the behavior of discharge patterns of 4 of 4 single motor units on the affected side showed abnormalities with characteristic features of an upper motor neuron lesion. Five out of 5 single motor units recorded from the right biceps were normal. An upper motor neuron lesion affecting the left arm, predicted by our results, was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed a lesion in the right precentral gyrus. It appears that changes in single motor unit firing characteristics, caused by an upper motor neuron lesion, can be detected at a time when there is no evidence of increased ""tone"" and/or hyperreflexia (spasticity) in the affected extremity.",Virus_Diseases
"The changing face of dermatology out-patient referrals in the south-east of Scotland. A study of out-patient dermatological services (NHS and private) in the south-east of Scotland was carried out by medical staff in the Department of Dermatology in Edinburgh during the month of November 1988. The aim was to assess changes in referral patterns and workload compared with the findings of an identical investigation undertaken in November 1981. Of particular interest were the possible effects of recent publicity campaigns aimed at increasing public awareness about skin cancer. The medical complement of the dermatology department had changed minimally since 1981 and the population increase in the south-east of Scotland over the same period was 1.5%. During November 1988 1592 new patients and 2037 review patients were seen. This represented an increase of 29.2% and 28.3%, respectively, since 1981. The most striking changes in diagnostic groups were a 173% rise in new cases presenting with benign tumours (excluding viral warts) and a 106% increase in new patients with malignant tumours. Viral warts and eczema were, as in 1981, the second and third most common diagnostic categories amongst new patients. There was a 98% increase in the number of surgical procedures performed on new patients compared with 1981. We conclude that the substantial increase in numbers of both benign and malignant tumours and the consequent doubling in surgical treatments was due to increased public awareness and concern about skin cancer.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Histologic abnormalities of large and small coronary arteries, neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart found in postmortem studies of individuals dying from the toxic oil syndrome. Hundreds died and thousands were poisoned by rapeseed oil adulterated with aniline and sold illegally in Spain in 1981. The clinical manifestations, now known as the toxic oil syndrome, include pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy plus widespread vascular and neural lesions in other organs. Many of the late deaths ended with a scleroderma-like illness. Because scleroderma involves the heart, in this study we examined the small and large coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system from eight victims dying with the toxic oil syndrome. Dense fibrosis of the sinus node in two hearts resembled changes found in scleroderma. Atrionodal junctional hemorrhages and cystic degeneration of the sinus node present in the other six hearts resembled changes found in lupus erythematosus. Small and large coronary arteries exhibited focal fibromuscular dysplasia and a proliferative cystic myointimal degeneration. This latter abnormality was associated with sloughing of the inner wall and embolization of the detached fragment downstream in the same coronary artery. Every heart had many degenerative lesions within nerves, ganglia, and the coronary chemoreceptor. Both the arterial and neural abnormalities prominently involved the conduction system. Based upon observations by others with experimental feeding of rapeseed oil containing either high or low erucic acid, we suggest that this oil must remain a major suspected cause of the toxic oil syndrome, particularly in conjunction with some as yet unexplained facilitative influence by oleoanilids. If this is so, it is important to reconsider the widely recommended use of any rapeseed oil product as a suitable food for man or other animals.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Steady-state mRNA levels of collagens I, III, fibronectin, and collagenase in skin biopsies of systemic sclerosis patients. Total RNA was extracted from skin biopsies of nine patients suffering from systemic sclerosis (SSc). Steady-state mRNA levels of collagen alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III), collagenase, fibronectin, and beta-actin were studied using specific cDNA probes and compared to those of 12 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals. There was a more than three-fold elevation of collagen I mRNA levels in SSc skin compared to controls. No difference was found, however, for collagen III, collagenase, and fibronectin mRNA levels in SSc and control biopsies. The selective increase of collagen alpha 1(I) mRNA levels indicates a specific alteration of fibroblast metabolism in scleroderma. Analysis of mRNA levels in skin biopsies might not only offer a direct approach to the understanding of the pathophysiology of SSc, but also facilitate the monitoring of fibrotic activity in SSc patients during therapeutic trials.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

We describe 4 children with seronegative inflammatory arthritis who had persistent, severe nausea and abdominal pain over several months, in spite of vigorous medical therapy, including antacids and histamine H2 receptor antagonists. Endoscopy and biopsy of gastric and duodenal mucosa showed antral gastritis and an increased number of mast cells in 3 of the 4 patients. In the fourth patient, urinary histamine levels were elevated. These findings suggest an association between inflammatory arthritis and localized mast cell disease in some individuals. Further studies are needed to determine whether this association represents an independent syndrome or whether mast cell-related disease is secondary to long-term treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in children with mild arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Newborn chemical exposure from over-the-counter skin care products. Human exposure to potentially toxic environmental chemicals is a major concern to our society. Over-the-counter (OTC) skin care products are a potential source of environmental chemical exposure to newborns. A prospective study was undertaken to define existing newborn bathing practices and quantitate environmental chemical exposure from OTC skin care products. One hundred-ninety six mothers of infants discharged from our newborn nursery were asked to respond to a questionnaire concerning newborn bathing practices and OTC skin care product usage. Complete questionnaires were returned by 23% of the mothers. The average newborn had 8 +/- 3 (+/- SEM) skin care products applied with the resultant exposure to 48 +/- 18 different environmental chemicals. Forty-seven percent of our respondents used a baby powder. The average one month old was bathed 4 times a week and was shampooed 3 times weekly. Seventy-eight percent of the respondents reported that their newborn had a rash but only 45% of those reporting a rash sought professional medical advice. Thirty-seven percent of the mothers reporting a rash made a change in bathing practice or product selection. In view of our findings, the human newborn is exposed to a large number of environmental chemicals thorough topical OTC preparations.

"Topical cyclosporine for oral mucosal disorders. Topical cyclosporine may be effective in the treatment of various oral mucosal disorders. In three open trials and in one double-blind study, a topical formulation of this drug produced significant improvement in oral lichen planus. Cyclosporine blood levels were generally low in these studies and no abnormalities of laboratory values resulted during use. Of six patients with oral bullous diseases treated with topical cyclosporine, four showed a decrease in erythema, partial healing of ulcerations, and a reduction in pain. Three patients relapsed shortly after cyclosporine was discontinued. Four of eight patients with persistent aphthous stomatitis remained virtually free of ulcers during 8 weeks of topical cyclosporine therapy. These results indicate that topical cyclosporine is beneficial as a therapy for oral lichen planus and possibly other mucosal diseases.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Classification and diagnosis of mastocytosis: current status. Mastocytosis is a disease characterized by an abnormal increase in mast cells. Manifestations of the disease are provoked in large part by the resultant increase in mast cell-derived mediators, which have a variety of local and systemic effects. Mastocytosis is variable in respect to the organ systems involved, clinical manifestations, and association with hematologic diseases. This has suggested the need for an improved classification scheme to allow assessment of prognosis and therapy.

"TGF-alpha is widely expressed in differentiated as well as hyperproliferative skin epithelium. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is a potent mitogen for epithelial cells that is expressed at low levels in normal epidermis and overexpressed in psoriasis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to inhibit hair growth but stimulate the growth of sebaceous and sweat glands, suggesting a potential role for a member of the EGF/TGF-alpha family in the normal development and function of skin appendages as well as epidermis. The present work demonstrates TGF-alpha protein in eccrine ducts, and eccrine, sebaceous, and apocrine glands. The proliferative dermal hair bulb does not express TGF-alpha in contrast to the differentiated outer root sheath hair follicle epithelia. In addition, hyperproliferative skin diseases including bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, squamous cell carcinoma, and psoriasis show increased TGF-alpha expression. Thus, TGF-alpha may play a role in the morphogenesis and function of normal skin appendages and its overexpression is common in benign and malignant hyperproliferative skin diseases.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Human immunodeficiency virus infection and indeterminate western blot patterns. Prospective studies in a low prevalence population. Interpretation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody results that are ""indeterminate"" rather than clearly positive or negative is problematic for the person delivering the result as well as for the individual being tested. To improve counseling messages for these individuals, we evaluated data collected from a well-characterized cohort of 387 blood donors who had been monitored for up to 2 years. We sought to determine if persons with indeterminate Western blot patterns were infected with HIV, and whether information derived from follow-up monitoring would assist in the development of counseling messages for persons on whom no follow-up information was available. Donors were studied by laboratory assays, clinical evaluation, and assessment of risk for HIV. The absence of HIV infection in 97 of 98 donors with indeterminate Western blot patterns was confirmed by clinical follow-up, Western blot assays of sequential samples, and negative gene amplification results. We propose supplemental guidelines to be used as an adjunct to existing interpretive criteria for counseling individuals when they first present with an indeterminate Western blot finding.",Virus_Diseases
"The role of antihistamines in atopic dermatitis. Although several lines of evidence support a role for histamine in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, antihistamines have generally offered only marginal therapeutic benefit. The efficacy of the classic antihistamines has been severely limited by sedative effects, demonstrating the need for improved, nonsedating agents. Multifunctional antihistamines, or third-generation ""antiallergic"" drugs, appear to offer a variety of advantages beyond their ability to inhibit histamine release, such as inhibition of mediator release and interference with eosinophil migration.

"Infection of inbred rat strains with Rift Valley fever virus: development of a congenic resistant strain and observations on age-dependence of resistance. A congenic rat strain (WF.LEW) was derived from the susceptible Wistar-Furth (WF) (background strain) and the resistant LEW (donor strain) inbred strains and was used to evaluate the phenotypic expression of a dominant Mendelian gene that confers resistance to fatal hepatic disease caused by the ZH501 strain of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Resistance to hepatic disease developed gradually with age, with full expression at approximately 10 weeks in the WF.LEW and LEW rat strains. The ZH501 strain caused fatal hepatitis in WF rats regardless of age. However, resistance to the SA75 RVFV strain (relatively non-pathogenic for adult rats), was age- and dose-dependent in both WF and LEW rats. The resistance gene transferred to the newly derived WF.LEW congenic rat strain appears to amplify age-dependent resistance of adult rats, resulting in protection against fatal hepatic disease caused by the virulent ZH501 strain. The congenic rat strain will be a valuable asset in elucidating the mechanism of resistance to Rift Valley fever virus governed by the dominant Mendelian gene.",Virus_Diseases

Six hundred seventy-one patients received 1017 new administrations of slow acting antirheumatic drugs during more than 2000 patient years of observation. The median time to discontinuation for intramuscular gold, auranofin, hydroxychloroquine or penicillamine was 2 years or less, but was 4.25 years for methotrexate (p = 0.008 vs all other drugs combined). Adverse reactions were a more common reason for discontinuation than efficacy, and both were less common in patients taking methotrexate (p less than 0.01).

In a double-blind, randomized, within-patient comparative study, the efficacy and tolerability of Ro 14-9706 (an arotinoid methyl sulfone) in the treatment of actinic keratoses was compared with that of tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid). A total of 25 patients with more than three lesions on each side of the face completed the study. All patients applied each agent twice daily for 16 weeks as a 0.05% cream to opposite sides of the face. The number of actinic keratoses in each treatment area was counted before treatment and at weekly intervals. The mean percent decrease in the number of actinic keratoses was 37.8% for areas treated with Ro 14-9706 and 30.3% for areas treated with tretinoin. Each of these decreases was significantly different from baseline (p less than 0.01), but not from each other.

"Interphase cytogenetics using biotin and digoxigenin labelled probes: III. Increased sensitivity and flexibility for detecting HPV in cervical biopsy specimens and cell lines. A monoclonal antibody to digoxin enabled sandwich techniques to be used for the detection of hybridised digoxigenin labelled probes in cultured cells and paraffin wax sections. This system has greater flexibility than alkaline phosphatase conjugated polyclonal antidigoxigenin antibody and permits the use of alternative detector enzymes, such as horseradish peroxidase and fluorescence labels. The APAAP detection system that does not require the use of biotin can also be used in situations where endogenous biotin is a problem. The low level of background staining combined with precise substrate deposition of the amplified peroxidase system gives higher sensitivity and resolution. This permits localisation of closely adjacent chromosomal loci in interphase nuclei. The most sensitive peroxidase based digoxigenin detection system visualises two and a half to 12 copies of human papillomavirus (HPV) per nucleus.

Two hundred eleven patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin (E) 50 mg/m2 and prednisolone (LEP) or E 100 mg/m2 and prednisolone (HEP). The intended treatment consisted of 16 courses of LEP or eight courses of HEP given at 3-weekly intervals. Reasons for stopping treatment early included progressive disease, stable disease without symptomatic improvement, or severe toxicity deemed intolerable by either the patient or physician. Toxicity was recorded at 3-weekly and response at 9-weekly intervals using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of response and toxicity. Two hundred nine patients were eligible for analysis, 98% of whom have been followed for more than a year. One hundred four patients received LEP and 105 HEP. Significantly worse myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and mucositis were seen in the high-dose arm (P less than or equal to .001). More patients in the LEP arm stopped treatment before the fourth course than in the HEP arm, and the commonest reason for stopping was progressive disease. A similar median number of courses was given in each arm. There was a significantly higher response in the HEP arm (HEP - complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] = 41%, LEP - CR + PR = 23%). Despite this, no statistically significant differences was seen in overall survival or progression-free interval.

"The use of in situ hybridization to show human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in metastatic cancer cells within lymph nodes. Southern blot hybridization has been used to identify human papillomavirus types in both primary tumors and lymph node metastases. However, this technique requires fresh-frozen tissue and is incapable of localizing deoxyribonucleic acid sequences to specific cell types in the tumor sample. In contrast, in situ hybridization precisely locates viral sequences within tumor cells while preserving cellular architecture. Further, in situ hybridization requires only small samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Five lymph nodes (from four patients) containing metastatic cervical squamous tumor cells (identified with hematoxylin and eosinophil staining) were analyzed with in situ hybridization techniques with human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid probes labeled with sulfur 35. The primary cervical cancer from all four patients had been shown to contain human papillomavirus type 16 sequences by Southern blot. Three specimens from two patients clearly showed the presence of human papillomavirus type 16 sequences within the nuclei of metastatic tumor cells, whereas two specimens were nondiagnostic most likely as a result of the small volume of cancer relative to the size of the lymph node. This information indicates that it is the tumor cells themselves that contain viral deoxyribonucleic acid and provides additional evidence linking human papillomavirus with cervical carcinogenesis.",Virus_Diseases

"Contact dermatitis from acrylate and methacrylate compounds in Lowicryl embedding media for electron microscopy. This report is about occupational contact dermatitis found in 3 out of 6 workers of a chemistry laboratory using Lowicryl embedding media, which contain (meth)acrylate monomer mixtures of known composition. The notation (meth)acrylates is used to refer to both acrylates and methacrylates. (Meth)acrylate monomers will polymerize in the absence of oxygen when induced by metal ions, peroxides, heat or ultraviolet light. The monomers are of low viscosity and remain in the liquid state at temperatures far below 0 degree C. The volatile compounds, some of which exhibit a most pungent odour, have a tendency to penetrate all tissue and to permeate into the finest fissures, a property which makes them suitable as sealants, glues, embedding material, etc. This and their toxicity may represent a danger to the health of individuals who need to work with them, especially if no precautions are taken. We show with patch testing that one patient reacted strongly to the compound 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate at the dilutions tested (0.5 and 1% v/v), but not at all to 10 other (meth)acrylates. In the same test, 3 volunteer controls were negative to 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate. We demonstrate that at maximum working concentration, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate penetrates both latex and vinyl gloves and elicits irritant/allergic reactions on the patient and irritant reactions on a control.

In comparison with Southern transfer hybridization, performed with the same probes used in the dot filter kit, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of dot filter hybridization were 90%, 94%, 74%, and 98%, respectively. Among patients with cervical cytologic dysplasia, HPV DNA was detected in 44% by dot filter hybridization and in 35% by Southern transfer hybridization. Although 26% of specimens positive by dot filter hybridization were not confirmed by Southern transfer hybridization, cervical dysplasia was detected in 5 (25%) of 20 with HPV DNA detected by dot filter hybridization alone, compared with 25 (8%) of those with no definitive evidence of HPV by either method (P = 0.009) and with 16 (30%) of 53 with HPV DNA detected by both methods (P = 0.7).

"Establishment from Shope carcinoma induced in an inbred rabbit of culture cell lines with various potentials for differentiation and tumorigenicity. Shope papillomas induced by cottontail rabbit papilloma-virus (CRPV) in domestic rabbits frequently regress spontaneously or, failing to do so, convert into squamous cell carcinomas at a high rate. This papilloma-carcinoma complex in rabbits provides an experimental model for human papillo-mavirus-associated malignancies. The aim of this study was to prepare an experimental system in inbred rabbits by establishing culture cell lines of the tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma developed from a Shope papilloma that had been induced 6 months previously by inoculating CRPV into an inbred B/J rabbit. By in vitro culturing of the tumor cells, cell lines with potentials for terminal differentiation and tumorigenicity were established. Cloning yielded sublines that varied in these potentials and possessed episomal and integrated CRPV genomes as revealed by Southern hybridization in both one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Major CRPV-specific transcripts were similarly observed both in well-differentiated and in poorly differentiated sublines. Immunofluorescence with syngeneic rabbit antibody against tumor-specific antigens localized such antigens mainly in the nuclei of the cells of these sublines. This experimental system allows experiments that were not feasible in randomly bred rabbits.",Virus_Diseases
"Effects of cyclosporine on immunologic mechanisms in psoriasis. A major impetus for further investigation of cellular immunologic mechanisms in psoriasis has been the discovery that cyclosporine, a potent immunosuppressive, is highly effective in the treatment of psoriasis. Cyclosporine has significant inhibitory effects on the ability of T cells to become activated. However, a direct activity of this drug on human keratinocyte signal transduction or growth has been difficult to demonstrate at relevant concentrations. Nevertheless, treatment of psoriasis or of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate-treated murine skin with cyclosporine does reverse many epidermal abnormalities that are common to these two systems. This suggests that the compound exerts an indirect effect on epidermal keratinocytes in vivo, perhaps through immunocyte inhibition. During treatment of psoriasis patients, cyclosporine therapy resulted in selective changes in the numbers and functions of certain antigen-presenting cell subsets (which were distinct from Langerhans cells) and T-cell subsets. These changes were accompanied by indirect evidence of decreased T-cell lymphokine release. Lesional activity of cyclosporine-treated psoriasis patients was closely correlated with the degree of T-cell activation caused by antigen-presenting cells. Cyclosporine inhibition of lymphokine or cytokine release may result in decreased recruitment of non-Langerhans antigen-presenting cells into the epidermis and thus decreased immunoreactivity in the lesion.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Detection of HIV-1 DNA and infectious virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a virus culture technique were used to detect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and infectious virus in cell-free CSF, respectively, of 28 HIV-1 seropositive homosexual men. Provirus was detected in 24 patients of whom 15 were also culture positive. One subject was virus culture positive but not PCR positive. Two asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive persons and one individual with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy were negative by both techniques. All of four patients with overt neurological symptoms, but also 20 of 24 patients without such symptoms were PCR positive. The data indicate that viral replication is common, and that the vast majority of HIV-1-infected individuals harbor the virus DNA in CSF, during all stages of infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Type VII collagen and 19-DEJ-1 antigen. Comparison of expression in inversa and generalized variants of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. The expression of type VII collagen and 19-DEJ-1 antigen was examined in 73 and 71 patients, respectively, with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), comprising gravis, mitis, inversa, and indeterminant subsets, to better determine the specificity and sensitivity of two monoclonal antibodies directed against these dermoepidermal junction-specific epitopes. Type VII collagen (LH 7:2 epitope) was usually absent (in 90%) in patients with the gravis variant of RDEB, whereas its expression was most often diminished (in 67%) in those with the mitis form of the disease. Only 2% and 5% of patients with gravis and mitis variants, respectively, had apparent normal amounts of type VII collagen within their skin. In contrast, six (86%) of seven patients with the inversa variant had normal expression of the antigen. Only 25% of all patients with RDEB lacked the 19-DEJ-1 antigen; of these, however, most had the gravis variant, although absence or diminution was also infrequently observed in those with the mitis and inversa forms. Intermediate findings were noted in patients classified as having indeterminant forms of RDEB. Some variability in antigen expression was also noted among affected siblings. We conclude that assessment of expression of the LH 7:2 epitope of type VII collagen may be diagnostically useful, although considerable overlap does exist between individual patients with gravis and mitis forms. 19-DEJ-1 expression is a far less sensitive probe in RDEB, although such data may prove useful in the assessment of newborns lacking the characteristic features of gravis disease. In addition, based on our experience with inversa RDEB, it would appear that altered expression of type VII collagen cannot be attributed to blister formation in this latter rare subset, since this antigen is usually strongly detected along the dermoepidermal junction, even in perilesional skin sites.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"New York State's two-dose schedule for measles immunization. In April 1989, New York became the first State in the United States to adopt a two-dose schedule for routine measles immunization. Although a two-dose schedule had been under discussion for the previous 10 years, this policy change was finally prompted in New York State by widespread measles outbreaks in 1989 among college and high school students who had been appropriately vaccinated with a single dose of measles vaccine. These outbreaks affected 21 college and secondary school campuses with 91 cases of measles and led to the administration of 53,093 doses of vaccine at a cost in excess of $859,000 for vaccine alone. In addition, there were major disruptions of intercollegiate athletic and scholastic events and physician and public confusion over the different recommendations for ""outbreak"" versus ""routine"" measles immunization. In response, the New York State Department of Health adopted a policy of two doses of measles vaccine required for entrance into kindergarten and college beginning in the fall of 1990. This report describes the data and process that were used in reaching this policy decision.",Virus_Diseases
"Fibroblast-keratinocyte interactions in psoriasis: failure of psoriatic fibroblasts to stimulate keratinocyte proliferation in vitro. We have tested in two ways the hypothesis that dermal fibroblasts direct the hyperproliferation of the overlying epidermis in psoriasis. First, culture medium from psoriatic and from normal skin fibroblasts was added to monolayer cultures of foreskin keratinocytes. Second, psoriatic and normal fibroblasts embedded in hydrated collagen lattices were co-cultured with monolayers of foreskin keratinocytes. There was no evidence in either study that psoriatic fibroblast products could stimulate the proliferation of the keratinocytes, or that normal fibroblast products inhibited their proliferation. A positive control for the fibroblasts was provided by leucocyte supernatants, which stimulated keratinocyte proliferation by up to 65%. Our data do not support a primary role for dermal fibroblasts in psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Use of in vitro clonogenic assays to differentiate acquired from genetic causes of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may be due directly to genetically programmed disorders of insulin action or acquired defects in which environmental factors influence insulin action. To address the issue of this distinction, we studied the ability of insulin to stimulate colony formation in primary cultures of erythroid progenitors (assumed to retain environmental influences) and immortalized T lymphocytes (presumed to reflect only genetic influences). Four patients with hyperinsulinemia and disturbed glucose metabolism were studied (2 patients with acanthosis nigricans, 1 of whom had circulating anti-insulin-receptor antibodies, 1 with partial lipodystrophy, and 1 with Cushing's syndrome). The mean colony-forming ability of their erythroid progenitor cells in response to insulin stimulation (less than or equal to 1.6 pM) was significantly blunted compared with control cells (P less than 0.05). The mean responsiveness of their immortalized T-lymphoblast cell lines to similar insulin concentrations was no different than that of control T-lymphocyte lines, consistent with an acquired cause for the observed insulin resistance in each case. A T-lymphocyte line from a patient with leprechaunism, however, showed no stimulation in response to physiological concentrations of insulin. With these same in vitro methodologies, there was normal T-lymphocyte line responsiveness to insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) or insulin concentrations greater than 8.6 pM; both of these responses could be completely blocked by preincubation with an antibody to the IGF-I receptor. These findings suggest that, despite resistance to physiological levels of insulin, the high circulating insulin concentrations present in the serum of these patients could mediate unwanted tissue-specific growth through an intact IGF-I receptor-effector mechanism.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"IgA and IgM human immunodeficiency virus antibodies in weakly reactive or false-negative blood donors. Detection of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in recently infected donors is crucial to prevent the transmission of HIV infection via blood products. To determine whether specific antibodies of the IgA or IgM class are present as markers of recent infection in donor specimens that have borderline reactivity on routine enzyme immunoassay (EIA) screening, 15 specimens that were positive by immunoblot were tested for IgA and IgM HIV antibodies. All 15 had detectable IgA HIV antibodies, and 14 had IgM HIV antibodies. The 15 specimens were tested further, each by two independent laboratories, with nine licensed EIAs. Two of the nine EIAs found all 15 units positive in both laboratories; seven EIAs found 1 to 5 of the 15 units negative, for a total of 31 false-negative results. The results indicated a difference between the sensitivity of EIA kits using only anti-IgG reagents and of kits using multispecific reagents that react with IgG and other classes of antibody. In a modified procedure, the addition of enzyme-conjugated anti-IgA or anti-IgM to the kit's enzyme-conjugated reagent increased the optical density values of most false-negative specimens to the positive range. It was concluded that licensed kits vary in reactivity with IgA and IgM HIV antibodies and that sensitivity could be increased by improved detection of these classes of antibody.",Virus_Diseases
"Penile implants in the treatment of Peyronie's disease. The treatment of Peyronie's disease remains controversial. Patients who fail conservative therapy may require surgical intervention to restore the ability to have sexual intercourse. Plaque excision and dermal grafting have not been universally successful, and alternate procedures that rely on the placement of a penile prosthesis have gained in popularity. We reviewed our experience with 35 patients with advanced Peyronie's disease treated with a penile prosthesis. Preoperatively, 55% of the patients were unable to engage in intercourse due to pain or angulation of the penis and 25% were unable to achieve any erection at all. Postoperatively, with a mean followup of 6.9 years, 88% of the patients were able to engage in intercourse and were satisfied with the results obtained. In selected patients with advanced disease the implantation of a penile prosthesis remains a highly successful and satisfying alternative for the treatment of Peyronie's disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hearing and vestibular disturbances in Behcet's syndrome. In order to evaluate the prevalence of audiovestibular disturbances in Behcet's syndrome, we submitted 20 consecutive patients and 20 control subjects to detailed audiologic and vestibular examination in the last 3 years. A sensorineural hearing loss was found in 12 patients, 2 of whom revealed sudden deafness. Two other patients with neuro-Behcet's syndrome showed a vestibular function deficit, and 3 others exhibited altered caloric stimulation test results. Two of these last patients also revealed a simultaneous bilateral auditory deficit. HLA typing showed the presence of the B51 antigen in 10 of the 14 patients with ear involvement, while only 3 of the 6 patients without ear involvement were HLA-B51-positive. Results suggest that audiovestibular involvement is common in Behcet's syndrome: sudden deafness may be the first sign of ear disturbance; vestibular lesions may represent an early sign of neuro-Behcet's syndrome; and the HLA-B51 antigen is associated with ear involvement. Otoneurologic study can reveal hidden brain stem lesions in Behcet's patients during flare-ups of the disease, even without obvious signs of neurologic deficits.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Temperature-sensitive tyrosinase associated with peripheral pigmentation in oculocutaneous albinism. Several types of autosomal recessive oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) are associated with abnormal tyrosinase function and a generalized reduction in or absence of cutaneous and eye melanin. Each is thought to result from a different mutant allele at the tyrosinase locus, with the mutation producing an enzyme with little or no activity in all involved tissues. In this paper, we report a new type of OCA that results from a tyrosinase allele producing a temperature-sensitive enzyme. The proband had white hair in the warmer areas (scalp and axilla) and progressively darker hair in the cooler areas (extremities) of her body. Melanocyte and melanosome architecture were normal. Quantitative hairbulb tyrosinase (dopa oxidase) assay demonstrated a loss of activity above 35-37 degrees C. Plasma pheomelanin and urine eumelanin intermediates were reduced and correlated with hair melanin content. This is the first temperature-sensitive tyrosinase mutation to be reported in humans and is analogous to the Siamese mutation in the cat and the Himalayan mutation in the mouse.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Prevalence of HIV-1 infection and symptomatology of AIDS in severely malnourished children in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 200 children with severe malnutrition and controls matched for age, sex, and area of residence were screened for serological evidence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) over 5 months in 1988. The prevalence of HIV-1 antibodies in the malnourished group was 25.5% (51 of 200) compared with 1.5% (three of 200) in the controls. The seroprevalence rate was equally high in malnourished children above the age of 18 months (26 of 102; 25.5%), as in those below this age (25 of 98; 25.5%). The prevalence rate was higher in children with marasmus (38.2%) as compared to children with marasmic-kwashiorkor (12.3%) or kwashiorkor (12.2%). The prevalence of clinical features known to be associated with AIDS was higher in the HIV seropositive malnourished children as compared to the seronegative children. The modified World Health Organization clinical case definition of AIDS in children was also evaluated and found to have a low sensitivity and positive predictive value (62.8 and 57.1%, respectively) but a fairly high specificity (83.9%). It is recommended to routinely rule out HIV infection in malnourished children, especially those with marasmus.",Virus_Diseases
"The incidence of Peyronie's disease in Rochester, Minnesota, 1950 through 1984. Peyronie's disease was diagnosed in 101 male residents of Rochester, Minnesota between 1950 and 1984. Mean patient age at diagnosis was 53 years. The average age-adjusted annual incidence rate of 25.7 and a prevalence rate of 388.6 per 100,000 male population were noted. The steady increase in incidence with time may reflect an increasing tendency to obtain medical help. However, the possibility of a true increase in the incidence rate cannot be ruled out.

"Production of a nef-specific monoclonal antibody by the use of a synthetic peptide. Monoclonal antibodies have been generated against a synthetic peptide of the nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in order to further characterize the biochemical and functional nature of this protein and its role in the control of HIV-1 transcriptional regulation. Earlier studies indicated nef to be a negative regulatory factor for viral transcription, whereas more recent studies report evidence against this original hypothesis. Nef is a protein of 206 amino acids of approximately 27 kD in most HIV-1 isolates; however, in some other isolates a truncated form of 124 amino acids has been described. A peptide sequence of six amino acids, corresponding to a region of the nef protein exhibiting high-sequence homology to thymosin alpha 1 protein, has been synthesized by Merrifield solid-phase methodology. This peptide is coded by a sequence located upstream to the stop codon described in some HIV-1 isolates and then is maintained in both complete and truncated forms of the nef protein. F14.11 is a nef peptide-specific monoclonal antibody (IgG2a/k) exhibiting the ability to recognize natural nef protein in either radioimmunoassay, radioimmunoprecipitation assay, or immunocytochemical analysis. Since F14.11 is able to identify nef protein in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes from HIV-infected seronegative subjects it may prove useful in monitoring the expression of nef during the silent HIV-1 infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Interface-area-to-volume ratio of interstitial fluid in humans determined by pharmacokinetic analysis of netilmicin in small and large skin blisters. Human pharmacokinetics of netilmicin during multiple dosing were studied in serum and in the fluid of skin blisters with two different ratios of interface area to fluid volume. The kinetics in the blisters followed the serum concentration-time curve with a delay but with a similar elimination half-life of 2.4 h. The kinetics in the 40-microliters blisters followed closely the theoretically calculated concentrations of the peripheral compartment of a two-compartment model. In contrast, the concentrations in the 120-microliter blisters increased less rapidly, lower peaks were achieved, and concentrations decreased with a significantly longer delay. A very similar area-specific flow or clearance rate of 1.6 microliters.h-1.mm-2 was calculated for the interface area between the serum compartment and either the small or large blisters. The observed rapid mass transfer between serum and blister fluid suggests similar oscillations of concentrations in serum and in small interstitial fluid compartments.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

A vaccinia virus double recombinant expressing the F and H genes of rinderpest virus protects cattle against rinderpest and causes no pock lesions. Rinderpest is a highly contagious viral disease of ruminants with greater than 95% morbidity and mortality. We have constructed an infectious vaccinia virus recombinant that expresses both the fusion (F) gene and the hemagglutinin (H) gene of rinderpest virus. The Wyeth strain of vaccinia virus was used for the construction of the recombinant. Cattle vaccinated with the recombinant virus were 100% protected from challenge inoculation with greater than 1000 times the lethal dose of rinderpest virus. No transmission of recombinant vaccinia virus from vaccinated animals to contact animals was observed. The lyophilized form of vaccinia virus is thermostable and allows circumvention of the logistical problems associated with the distribution and administration of vaccines in the arid and hot regions of Asia and Africa. The insertional inactivation of both the thymidine kinase and the hemagglutinin genes of vaccinia virus led to increased attenuation of the virus; this was manifested by the lack of detectable pock lesions in vaccinated animals. This approach may have wide application in the development of safe and efficacious recombinant vaccines for humans and animals. This becomes quite relevant with the concern of the use of vaccinia virus in a population with high incidence of the human immunodeficiency virus.,Virus_Diseases

Rheumatoid factor (RF) was assayed in 354 unaffected first degree relatives from 59 families with multicase rheumatoid arthritis (RA), using both the latex test and ELISA for different RF isotypes. The association between HLA and presence of RF was also analyzed. In all, 39% of the relatives were positive for at least one class of RF compared to 7% positive for latex. There were no differences between the sexes in these rates. There were significant excess rates of HLA-DR4 in RF positive when compared to the RF negative relatives. The HLA-DR4 frequency in these RF positive RA negative individuals is similar to that observed in series of RA positive patients.

"The role of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I in experimental renal growth and scarring. Recent evidence suggests a causal link between early renal/glomerular hypertrophy and late kidney scarring and glomerular sclerosis. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a growth-promoting peptide likely to play a role in the development of kidney growth. We observed an increased renal IGF-I content in two experimental models of accelerated kidney growth in the rat. By contrast, diabetic renal hypertrophy is abolished in the absence of growth hormone (GH). Dietary protein manipulations affect the expression of compensatory renal growth (CRG), as well as renal IGF-I content. The renotrophic effect of a high-protein diet on CRG seems GH-dependent and IGF-I-mediated. GH also appears to have a permissive role on the development of progressive renal scarring following extensive renal ablation in rats, as dwarf rats seem somewhat resistant to the development of accelerated scarring and renal failure.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Effect of chronic treatment with the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 in man: toxicity, immunological, and hormonal aspects. Suppression of immune function was traditionally thought to occur only with pharmacological levels of glucocorticoids. However, recent studies in rodents have suggested that glucocorticoids exert tonic antiinflammatory/immunosuppressive effects even at basal nonstress concentrations. To examine whether basal glucocorticoid secretion modulates immune function in man we employed the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486. If a tonic level of inhibition of the immune system by basal glucocorticoid levels was present, then a potentiation or enhancement of immune function might evolve in the absence of glucocorticoid action. To examine this hypothesis, we studied 11 healthy male normal volunteers who received RU 486 (10 mg/kg.day) or placebo vehicle, divided into 2 daily oral doses, for 7-14 days. Blood samples were collected every 2 days for measurement of plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations along with 24-h urine samples for measurement of 17-hydroxysteroid and free cortisol excretion. Complete and differential blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and quantitative immunoglobulins were also determined at 2-day intervals. Leukocytes were obtained by leukopheresis for phenotypic characterization and functional analysis before and 7 days after the initiation of RU 486 or placebo therapy. Blockade of cortisol receptors with RU 486 was associated with marked compensatory elevations of plasma ACTH and cortisol and increases in 24-h urinary excretion of 17-hydroxysteroids and free cortisol. Unexpectedly, 8 of the 11 subjects developed generalized exanthem after 9 days of RU 486 treatment. One subject developed symptoms and signs consistent with the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Total white blood cell counts, absolute lymphocyte, neutrophil and eosinophil counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and quantitative immunoglobulins did not change with RU 486 therapy. Similarly, T-, B-, and natural killer cell subsets did not change during RU 486 treatment. Furthermore, functional evaluation of lymphocyte cytotoxicity and proliferation revealed no changes. We conclude that administration of high doses of RU 486 to normal volunteers does not result in measurable enhancement of immune function. This suggests that in man, glucocorticoids may not exert a tonic inhibitory effect on the immune system as they appear to do in rodents. Alternatively, the compensatory increase in endogenous cortisol may obviate any effect of the glucocorticoid antagonist on the immune system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Drug-induced pemphigus: autoantibodies directed against the pemphigus antigen complexes are present in penicillamine and captopril-induced pemphigus. Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by circulating autoantibodies directed against the keratinocyte cell surface. The two variants, pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris, can be distinguished at the molecular level by immunochemical studies. The large majority of patients with pemphigus develop the disease spontaneously; however, there is a small group of patients who develop pemphigus after treatment with certain medications, of which penicillamine and captopril are the best documented. Most patients with drug-induced pemphigus have circulating and/or tissue bound epidermal cell surface autoantibodies; however, the molecular specificity of these autoantibodies has not been studied. We performed immunoprecipitation studies utilizing extracts of 125I-labeled suction blister epidermis and the sera of three patients with drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus (two due to penicillamine and one due to captopril) and one patient with captopril-induced pemphigus vulgaris. We found that the three patients with drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus had circulating autoantibodies that are directed against the pemphigus foliaceus antigen complex and that the one patient with drug-induced pemphigus vulgaris had circulating autoantibodies that are directed against the pemphigus vulgaris antigen complex.

"The relationship of pain and deformity of the rheumatoid foot to gait and an index of functional ambulation. We evaluated the relationships among pain, structural deformity of the foot, 4 variables of gait, and an index of functional ambulation in 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We saw significant correlations between the ambulation index and all gait variables (p less than 0.005). For the group as a whole, pain in the foot did not correlate with structural deformity. However, when patients were grouped according to the relative preponderance of pain or deformity and duration of disease, we found correlations between the sites of pain and deformity. Pain in the lower extremity, and the knee or hindfoot separately, showed correlations with functional ambulation. Foot deformity did not correlate with functional ambulation at all. Foot pain correlated well with velocity and especially stride length (p less than 0.005), and not as well with cadence and double stance time.

Twenty-five patients had ulcers, 12 of these patients had a history of previous deep venous thrombosis and 13 of these patients denied such an event. Seventeen patients had normal ankle skin, 10 of these patients had a documented history of deep vein thrombosis and seven of these patients had varicose veins only. An ultrasonic duplex scanner was used to document the presence of reflux in all segments of the superficial and deep system. In the entire group of 25 limbs with ulceration, valvular incompetence was noted in 22 limbs at levels involving segments that communicated with the ulcer-bearing area. Of the 17 limbs with normal ankle skin, in only two instances was a single segment of posterior tibial vein in midcalf found to be incompetent. For those patients with normal ankle skin and a history of varicose veins, the deep veins below the common femoral vein level were always competent.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Identification of a recombinant HTLV-II envelope protein for serological detection of HTLV-II carriers. To understand the pathogenic potential and the true extent of human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) infection, it is important to develop a specific HTLV-II antigen-based serological test. Plasmid pIIB was constructed and induced in Escherichia coli to express a recombinant protein (RP) containing 140 amino acids (amino acid residues 96 to 235) from the middle region of the HTLV-II exterior envelope glycoprotein gp52. Serum samples from polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HTLV-II-infected people, HTLV-I carriers, and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients were tested for antibody reactivity to RP-IIB by Western blot assay. The results showed all 27 HTLV-II carriers, 10 of 20 HTLV-I carriers, and 4 of 17 (23.5%) ATL patients had antibody reactivities to RP-IIB. The difference in rates of seropositivity to RP-IIB between HTLV-II carriers (100%) and HTLV-I-infected people (carriers plus ATL patients) (37.8%) is statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 4.30E-08).",Virus_Diseases
"Retinoic acid receptor gene expression in human skin. Human skin exhibits a characteristic, pleiotypic response to topical retinoic acid. In attempting to understand this response at the molecular level, we have used fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and RNA blot hybridization to characterize the expression of the nuclear retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha, beta, and gamma genes in adult human epidermis. Size exclusion FPLC of 0.6 M NaCl nuclear extracts prepared from keratome biopsies revealed two peaks of specific [3H] retinoic acid (RA) binding at Mr 45 and 18 kDa, in agreement with the expected sizes of RAR and cellular RA binding protein. Blot hybridization analysis of total RNA extracted from keratome biopsies revealed that RAR-gamma was the predominant RAR species expressed in human epidermis, as RAR-alpha transcripts were detectable only at low levels and RAR-beta transcripts were undetectable. RAR transcripts were not induced by topical treatment with 0.1% RA cream under occlusion for 4 h or 4 d. Moreover, there was no significant difference in RAR-gamma transcript levels in normal and psoriatic epidermis. RAR-gamma transcripts were constitutively expressed not only in cultured human keratinocytes, but also in human dermal and lung fibroblasts. RAR-beta was induced by RA in dermal fibroblasts, but not in keratinocytes. RA induced IL-1 beta transcripts in keratinocytes rapidly (2 to 4 h) and at low concentrations (3 x 10(-10) M), consistent with activation of the IL-1 beta gene via RAR. These results demonstrate constitutive expression of RAR-gamma in human epidermis, and suggest that RAR-gamma is a molecular target of RA action in adult human skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency in hyperandrogenism. OBJECTIVE: to determine the 11-deoxycortisol (S) response and incidence of 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency in hyperandrogenism. DESIGN: Hyperandrogenic women prospectively and consecutively underwent acute adrenal stimulation studies. SETTING: Tertiary institution. PATIENTS: Two hundred sixty women complaining of hirsutism and/or hyperandrogenic oligomenorrhea were studied, excluding five unrelated families (1.9% of total) suffering from 21-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. Forty-one healthy premenopausal eumenorrheic women served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Only two unrelated women (0.8%) had a poststimulation or net increment S level value greater than or equal to threefold the upper 95th percentile of controls and were presumed to suffer from 11 beta-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. One hundred nine (42%) of hyperandrogenic women had at least one S value above the 95th percentile of controls. These women also demonstrated higher basal (F0) and stimulated cortisol levels, but a similar increment compared with controls. RESULTS: Patients with high S measures had higher testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione levels, but similar luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratios, than hyperandrogenic cohorts with no abnormal S measures. Basal values of S (S0), F0, or S0/F0 were not useful to predict an abnormal S response to stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Although adrenocortical hyperactivity was present in 42% of our hyperandrogenic patients, only 0.8% were presumed to suffer from 11 beta-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. A systemic search for this deficiency in hyperandrogenism is probably unwarranted.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Acitretin plus UVB therapy for psoriasis. Comparisons with placebo plus UVB and acitretin alone. UVB radiation is beneficial for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. Patients with recalcitrant disease, however, are slow to respond to UVB phototherapy with and without the use of coal tars or emollients. Etretinate and, more recently, acitretin have proved useful, but clinical improvement is slow when they are used as monotherapy in plaque psoriasis. Each drug also produces side effects, some of which are dose related. This study was designed to compare results of treatment with UVB combined with either acitretin (50 mg/day) or placebo to determine if psoriasis would respond faster and to less cumulative exposure to UVB and acitretin. The psoriatic disease cleared to a greater degree in patients treated with acitretin-UVB with fewer treatments and smaller amounts of UVB radiation than in patients treated with either placebo-UVB or acitretin alone.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Systemic mastocytosis presenting as osteoporosis: a clinical and histomorphometric study. Ten patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) were evaluated for their metabolic bone disease (4 men and 6 women; mean +/- SD, 59 +/- 13 yr). All patients presented with generalized osteopenia and/or atraumatic vertebral compression fractures. Three patients had long-standing urticaria pigmentosa; in these, the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis had been established by skin biopsy. One of the 3 and 2 of the other 7 individuals had symptoms suggestive of SM. Although six patients had previously undergone decalcified bone marrow trephine core biopsy (DBMB), findings were consistent with SM in only 2 of them. X-Ray survey revealed generalized osteopenia in all 10 patients and vertebral compression fractures in 9. No patient had sclerotic bone lesions. Histological findings of undecalcified transiliac crest biopsy (UTBB) specimens from 9 patients (5 patients underwent both DBMB and UTBB, 4 underwent only UTBB, and 1 had only DBMB) disclosed bone marrow that contained nodules characteristic of mast cell granulomas and numerous scattered oval- and spindle-shaped mast cells. The trabecular bone contained abundant newly synthesized bone matrix and a significant increase in osteoblastic, osteoclastic, and resorptive surfaces. Dynamic histomorphometric parameters revealed a significantly increased mineral apposition rate. Our study suggests that SM may be a more frequent cause of osteoporosis than previously recognized. Generalized osteopenia with compression fractures may be the only presentation of SM. Undecalcified bone biopsy is useful in the diagnosis of SM. Accelerated bone remodeling is a characteristic histomorphometric feature of SM with diffuse osteopenia.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"The role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Psoriatic involved skin contains an increased number of activated T cells. The mechanism through which these T cells achieve and maintain their activated state is unknown, and both antigen-dependent and -independent mechanisms may contribute. Recently a novel pathway of antigen-independent T-cell activation has been described. This pathway is identified by a monoclonal antibody that binds to a T-cell membrane surface molecule termed ""UM4D4."". This molecule is expressed on a minority (20%) of psoriatic peripheral blood T cells but on a majority (75%) of the T cells in lesional skin. Thus, UM4D4 could play a role in antigen-independent T-cell activation in psoriasis. Indeed the monoclonal antibody anti-UM4D4 consistently induces proliferation of psoriatic UM4D4+ T-cell clones. The activity of antigen-dependent pathways are also enhanced in psoriatic epidermis in as much as involved skin relative to uninvolved skin contains an increased number and function of antigen-presenting cells. Upon activation, the lesional T cells release lymphokines. Central to the immune hypothesis of psoriasis is that some of these T-cell lymphokines act on keratinocytes to induce changes characteristic of psoriasis. Indeed lymphokines from lesional psoriatic T-cell clones directly alter in vitro keratinocyte phenotype through induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and HLA-DR cell-surface expression. Furthermore, the lymphokines also enhance keratinocyte growth. These data suggest a critical role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis by sodium fluoride treatment of osteoporosis. Recent studies have suggested that sodium fluoride therapy may be an effective treatment for vertebral osteoporosis. Unfortunately, the high frequency of side effects may limit the use of this treatment modality. This report documents the repeated exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis on three occasions after the initiation of sodium fluoride therapy. This apparent complication of sodium fluoride treatment may be mediated by stimulation of leukocyte production of reactive oxygen species and other mediators of the acute inflammatory response. We suggest that sodium fluoride should be used cautiously in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Epidemiologic patterns of wild-type hepatitis A virus determined by genetic variation. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) isolates from different parts of the world are a single serotype. However, genetic analysis of the VP1 genome region of published HAV sequences suggested that distinct genotypes of HAV could be defined based upon the geographic source of the original isolates. To circumvent the process of cell culture adaptation or animal passage, a 247-bp segment within the VP1 genome region of wild-type HAV was amplified by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification in the presence of negative- and positive-sense primers. From the sequences obtained from 22 epidemiologically distinct HAV isolates, three genetic groups of HAV could be delineated. Two of the groups differed by 10%, while the third group differed from other isolates by approximately 20%. These investigations indicate that HAV isolates from different parts of the world can be differentiated genetically, which will facilitate studies of epidemiologic transmission.",Virus_Diseases
"Salt-split human skin substrate for the immunofluorescent screening of serum from patients with cicatricial pemphigoid and a new method of immunoprecipitation with IgA antibodies. In patients with cicatricial pemphigoid, immunoglobulins (usually IgG) and complement are deposited within the dermoepidermal junction and are detected by direct immunofluorescent staining of perilesional mucous membrane and/or skin with fluorescein-labeled antibodies to human immunoglobulins. Although rare, some patients also have circulating low-titer, anti-basement membrane zone autoantibodies. In this study, we report 11 patients with the clinical, histologic, and immunologic criteria for cicatricial pemphigoid who had circulating anti-BMZ autoantibodies as demonstrated by positive indirect staining of a normal human skin that had been fractured through the dermoepidermal junction by prolonged incubation in a cold, 1 mol/L sodium chloride solution. On this salt-split human skin substrate, 9 of the 11 patients (82%) had autoantibodies that bound to the epidermal roof, one serum stained only the dermal floor, and one serum stained both sides of the separation. The predominant class of immunoglobulin in the patients' sera that bound to the substrate was IgA; IgA was the single immunoglobulin in 55% and was associated with IgG in 18%. IgG was the only immunoglobulin detected in 27% of the cases. No specific protein was detected by either Western immunoblot or a new IgA immunoprecipitation procedure.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Acute porphyria presenting with hyperamylasemia. An elevation of serum amylase and lipase has not been reported previously to occur with porphyria. In this report, we describe a patient who presented with the clinical and laboratory picture of pancreatitis: elevated amylase, lipase, amylase-creatinine clearance ratio, and with abdominal pain. Only after extensive evaluation, was the patient found to have porphyria. On two separate occasions, with hematin therapy, her serum amylase decreased, as did her clinical symptoms of porphyria and her urinary quantitative porphyrins. This suggests an association between elevation of the serum amylase and lipase with acute porphyria. Moreover, this association can lead to delay in establishing the diagnosis of acute porphyria.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Astroviruses as a cause of gastroenteritis in children. BACKGROUND. Infection with astroviruses has been associated with gastroenteritis in children, and serologic surveys indicate that this infection may be frequent. The importance of astroviruses as agents of gastroenteritis has not been shown in a controlled study, however. METHODS. We used monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassays to detect astroviruses, enteric adenoviruses, and rotaviruses in stool samples obtained from age-matched children with and children without gastroenteritis. The samples were obtained in two studies, three years apart, among patients attending an outpatient clinic in Bangkok, Thailand. RESULTS. In the first study, astroviruses were detected in 8.6 percent (96 of 1111) of the children with gastroenteritis and in 2.0 percent (19 of 947) of the children without gastroenteritis. In the second study the rates were 8.6 percent (50 of 580) and 2.1 percent (11 of 512), respectively. For both studies combined, enteric adenoviruses were detected in 2.6 percent of those with gastroenteritis and in 0.5 percent of the controls, whereas rotaviruses were detected in 19 percent of those with gastroenteritis and in 1.0 percent of the controls. The clinical findings associated with astrovirus infection were similar to those associated with rotavirus infection, except for a trend toward greater dehydration in the children infected with rotaviruses. CONCLUSIONS. These two controlled studies involving a total of 3150 Thai children provide evidence that astroviruses are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis. Astroviruses were found in association with gastroenteritis more frequently than were enteric adenoviruses, and with nearly half the frequency of rotaviruses.",Virus_Diseases

"Regional fasciocutaneous flaps for the burned axilla. The conventional approach for secondary correction of unstable axillary scars or contractures with skin grafting commonly risks failure of adherence and early recurrence of the problem, even in highly motivated patients. Potential early mobilization and the avoidance of postoperative splinting may be advantages of reconstruction with vascularized tissues instead. The local fasciocutaneous flap is advocated as a simple, rapidly elevated, single-staged option that preserves function while correcting these deformities. Although the dorsal thoracic fascial flaps are the most versatile in the axillary region, if they are unavailable or unsuitable, other unspecified but equally robust alternatives from the upper arm or anterolateral chest are similarly efficacious.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Junin virus activity in rodents from endemic and nonendemic loci in central Argentina. Small mammals were trapped during a 21-month period at 27 farm sites in 15 localities within and beyond the known endemic area for Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). Prevalence of Junin virus (JV) was assessed by antigen-capture enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) on samples of body fluids and/or organs from 3, 282 captured rodents. Infection in rodent populations was variable (0-3.7%) among localities but, in all cases, was lower than previously reported rates. Overall prevalence was 1.4% in the AHF epidemic area, 0.6% in the historic (currently low incidence of AHF) area, and 0.4% in two localities beyond the previously defined endemic area. These low values underestimate the actual prevalence of JV, as ELISA validation by virus isolation indicated a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 99%. Of 37 positive rodents, 28 (76%) were of two species: Calomys musculinus (23 animals) and C. laucha (5 animals). Antigen also was found in three Akodon azarae, four Bolomys obscurus, one Mus musculus, and one Oxymycterus rufus, and JV was isolated from two Oligoryzomys flavescens. Three of these rodent species (B. obscurus, O. flavescens, and O. rufus) have heretofore not been implicated in JV maintenance in the field.

"Neutralizing and complement-dependent enhancing antibodies in different stages of HIV infection. Reclustering and indirect immunofluorescence assays on MT-4 cells [carrying both CD4 and complement receptor type 2 (CR2)] were used to measure neutralizing and enhancing antibodies in sera obtained from HIV-1-infected individuals. Heat-inactivated sera were tested before and after mixing 1:1 with fresh seronegative human serum. Using heated samples, neutralizing antibodies were found in 20 out of 20 and 11 out of 19 serum samples of asymptomatic and symptomatic [AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC)] HIV-seropositive patients, respectively. In complement-restored samples, neutralizing activity was found in eight sera of asymptomatic patients and in none of the sera of AIDS and ARC patients; enhancing activity could be detected in four and 12 sera, respectively. A significant positive correlation was observed between the titres of neutralizing antibodies measured in the complement-restored samples and the absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes. These findings indicate that the appearance of complement-dependent enhancing antibodies coincident with the loss of neutralizing antibodies may indicate a poor prognosis in HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Possible etiologic heterogeneity of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. A correlation of pathologic characteristics with human papillomavirus detection by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. A correlated histopathologic and molecular virologic study of 30 cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 (VIN 3) and six associated invasive vulvar carcinomas was performed. Paraffin sections were examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 by in situ hybridization for viral transcripts and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of HPV and of the beta-globin gene. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 was histologically subclassified into warty (bowenoid) (20 cases) and basaloid (undifferentiated) (ten cases) types. Warty VIN characteristically was composed of squamous cells displaying abnormal proliferation and maturation and an undulating or spiked surface creating a ""condylomatous"" appearance whereas basaloid VIN had a smooth surface and was composed of undifferentiated basaloid cells resembling carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Human papillomavirus-16 was the only type detected in 16 of 30 VIN 3 and in five of six invasive carcinomas. The HPV-positive women were younger than HPV-negative women (mean age at diagnosis, 49 versus 60 years), their lesions more frequently demonstrated koilocytotic atypia (94% versus 43%), and they were more likely to have warty compared with basaloid VIN lesions (65% versus 30%). These findings suggest that there are at least two different types of VIN which have differing clinical, pathologic, and viral profiles.",Virus_Diseases
"The burden of acute respiratory infection due to measles in developing countries and the potential impact of measles vaccine. Measles is a major cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in developing countries. Hospital and community-based studies of ALRI have found that measles accounts for 6%-21% of the morbidity and 8%-93% of the mortality due to ALRI. Although live attenuated measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines in use today, measles has not been controlled in many parts of the world, primarily because the levels of vaccine coverage required to interrupt measles transmission have not been achieved. In addition, in some areas, a large percentage of cases of measles occur in infants who are younger than the age recommended for vaccination. Recent studies suggest that the Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine may be more immunogenic than other vaccine strains in young infants. A substantial proportion of ALRI could be prevented by increasing measles vaccine coverage and by the use of particular vaccine strains in younger children.",Virus_Diseases
"Vasodilatory capacity of the skin in venous disease and its relationship to transcutaneous oxygen tension. Low transcutaneous oxygen tension (Ptc,O2) values in the supramalleolar skin of patients with venous disease are often reported. This measurement involves heating the skin to 43 degrees C to cause maximum vasodilatation and is valid only if liposclerotic and normal skin can vasodilate to the same degree. Forty-four limbs were studied, 15 with lipodermatosclerosis (LDS), 14 with uncomplicated varicose veins, and 15 controls. A Ptc,O2 electrode was modified to incorporate a laser Doppler probe. Laser Doppler flux was measured in the supramalleolar skin before and after local heating to 43 degrees C and the relative increase in flux was measured. The Ptc,O2 was then measured at the same site and on the chest. Vasodilatory capacity was expressed as the ratio of peak:basal laser Doppler flow, and the Ptc,O2 was expressed as a leg:chest ratio. Median laser Doppler flow was higher in limbs with LDS (median 67 mV) than in normal limbs (median 40 mV) (P less than 0.03). Ptc,O2 was higher in control limbs (median ratio 0.94) than in limbs with LDS (median 0.53) (P less than 0.006). The microcirculation in LDS had less capacity to vasodilate after heating (median factor of increase 5.4) than normal skin (median factor of increase 12.3) (P less than 0.001). A simple regression analysis was performed on all pairs of data, and revealed a correlation between Ptc,O2 and vasodilatory capacity (r = 0.524, P less than 0.001). The results indicate that low Ptc,O2 levels in venous disease reflect an inability of the microcirculation to increase its flow in response to local heating; inferences about the oxygen content of liposclerotic skin at normal temperatures cannot be drawn using this technique.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Expression of osteonectin, decorin, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 genes in fibroblasts cultured from patients with systemic sclerosis and morphea. A characteristic feature of fibroblasts cultured from affected skin areas of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and localized scleroderma (morphea) is excessive activation of collagen biosynthesis. To elucidate the nature of fibroblast activation in scleroderma we have studied the expression of 3 noncollagenous connective tissue components, osteonectin, small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (proteoglycan II, decorin), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), by measuring their mRNA levels in fibroblast cultures from 6 patients with SSc and 3 with morphea. A clear correlation was observed between the increase in type I collagen and osteonectin mRNA in these cell lines. The apparent overproduction of osteonectin by scleroderma fibroblasts is in accordance with the suggested activation of osteonectin expression during tissue remodeling. The levels of decorin mRNA showed marked variation in the cell lines, but were in no correlation with collagen or osteonectin mRNA. The levels of TGF-beta 1 mRNA were found to be slightly elevated in fibroblasts grown from affected scleroderma skin. This may suggest that this potent activator of collagen production has a role during the initial activation of dermal fibroblasts both in SSc and morphea.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Protection of macaques with a simian immunodeficiency virus envelope peptide vaccine based on conserved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 sequences. This report describes the vaccination of rhesus macaques with peptides selected from regions of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope that are hydrophilic, immunoreactive, and highly homologous with corresponding conserved envelope sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The peptides, produced as beta-galactosidase fusion proteins, induced virus-neutralizing and peptide-specific antibodies. After challenge with virulent virus, controls became virus positive and developed gradually rising antibody titers to SIV over 63 weeks. Immunized macaques developed a postchallenge anamnestic response to SIVenv antigens within 3-6 weeks followed by a gradual, fluctuating decline in SIV antibody titers and partial or total suppression of detectable SIV. Virus suppression correlated with prechallenge neutralizing antibody titers. Although the average CD4+ cell count in the blood of immunized macaques remained constant, the control macaques exhibited a progressive decrease developing about week 55 after challenge. The conserved nature of the HIV and SIV peptides and the similar humoral immunoreactivity in the respective hosts suggest that homologous HIV peptides may be important components of a successful immunization strategy.",Virus_Diseases

"A measles outbreak at a college with a prematriculation immunization requirement. BACKGROUND. In early 1988 an outbreak of 84 measles cases occurred at a college in Colorado in which over 98 percent of students had documentation of adequate measles immunity (physician diagnosed measles, receipt of live measles vaccine on or after the first birthday, or serologic evidence of immunity) due to an immunization requirement in effect since 1986. METHODS. To examine potential risk factors for measles vaccine failure, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among students living in campus dormitories using student health service vaccination records. RESULTS. Overall, 70 (83 percent) cases had been vaccinated at greater than or equal to 12 months of age. Students living in campus dormitories were at increased risk for measles compared to students living off-campus (RR = 3.0, 95% CI = 2.0, 4.7). Students vaccinated at 12-14 months of age were at increased risk compared to those vaccinated at greater than or equal to 15 months (RR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.7, 5.7). Time since vaccination was not a risk factor for vaccine failure. Measles vaccine effectiveness was calculated to be 94% (95% CI = 86, 98) for vaccination at greater than or equal to 15 months. CONCLUSIONS. As in secondary schools, measles outbreaks can occur among highly vaccinated college populations. Implementation of recent recommendations to require two doses of measles vaccine for college entrants should help reduce measles outbreaks in college populations.",Virus_Diseases
"Generalized pustulation as a manifestation of the anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome. BACKGROUND.-The anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome is characterized by the development of fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatitis, and is associated with leukocytosis and eosinophilia. This article describes the unusual development of a follicular pustular eruption in two patients as a manifestation of this syndrome. OBSERVATIONS.-This pustular eruption most commonly develops on the face and scalp but may subsequently become generalized. While cultures of the pustules are negative, biopsy specimens reveal a dilated follicular infundibulum filled with neutrophils. Recognition of cutaneous pustulation as a potential manifestation of this syndrome is important, as a generalized pustular eruption developing in a febrile patient can easily be confused with an infectious process. CONCLUSIONS.-The anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome may present with a follicular pustular eruption rather than the more commonly associated macular or papular rash or erythroderma. The three most commonly used anticonvulsants, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, can each produce an identical hypersensitivity reaction. In addition, in vitro testing has demonstrated that approximately 80% of patients tested to all three medications had positive reactions to each. Furthermore, with in vitro testing researchers are able to predict which anticonvulsants are safe to use, thereby allowing for prospective individualization of therapy. However, this technology is not yet available for widespread use.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Treatment of psoriasis with piritrexim, a lipid-soluble folate antagonist  Methotrexate is an effective and convenient treatment for severe psoriasis whose use is limited by the development of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in a small number of patients. The mechanism of hepatotoxicity is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of intracellular polyglutamation and prolonged retention of methotrexate within the cell. Piritrexim isethionate is a lipid-soluble antifolate that has a mechanism of action similar to that of methotrexate. Since it is not polyglutamated, piritrexim could be effective in the treatment of psoriasis without the associated long-term hepatotoxicity. A 12-week phase I/II clinical trial of severe chronic plaque psoriasis assessed the safety and efficacy of oral piritrexim therapy. Based on experience gained from oncologic trials, each patient received a twice-daily dosage for 5 consecutive days every 2 weeks. Dosages ranged from 25 to 100 mg twice a day. Improvement in both lesion scores and percentage of body involvement was significant at a dose of 50 mg or more twice daily. Fifteen of 19 patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy demonstrated greater than 50% improvement in lesion scores. Improvement was limited by recrudescence of lesions over the 9-day rest period. Adverse experiences were minimal and dose related. Piritrexim is efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Studies of laminin and type IV collagen in blisters of porphyria cutanea tarda and drug-induced pseudoporphyria. Blisters from five patients with porphyria cutanea tarda and two patients with drug-induced pseudoporphyria were examined by direct immunofluorescence and by immunofluorescence mapping with antibodies against laminin and type IV collagen to determine the level of subepidermal separation. Primary screening by direct immunofluorescence revealed the characteristic immune deposits in the vessel walls of the upper dermal plexus in all cases and at the dermoepidermal junction in five of seven cases. Type IV collagen and laminin were reactive in six and five cases, respectively, and appeared in the floor of the bulla. The findings were identical in porphyria and pseudoporphyria. In one case in which the bullous pemphigoid antigen could be detected, it appeared in the epidermal roof of the bulla. These findings indicate that the split in porphyria and pseudoporphyria occurs in the lamina lucida.

These studies have suggested that germline genes with little if any somatic mutation can generate RF specificity. However, there is no information presently available regarding the primary structure and genetic origin of RF in rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we have isolated and sequenced the VH regions of six monoclonal RF derived from the synovial membranes of two patients with rheumatoid arthritis and one with the juvenile polyarticular form of the disease. We found the same VH families as previously reported among monoclonal paraproteins with RF activity. However, our sample was diverse regarding the VH, DH, and JH gene segments used. Among VHI RF there was conservation in the length of CDRIII as well as restriction in the amino acid generated at the V-D junction, as opposed to VHIII RF and non-RF VHI molecules that are highly heterogeneous in these two aspects. We also found that different JH gene segments may contribute to RF specificity. The VH, DH, and JH elements of one RF in our study all had clearly identifiable germline counterparts. This RF displays a nearly germline configuration throughout its entire heavy chain and represents another example of an autoantibody encoded by one of the VH gene segments from the preimmune fetal repertoire.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Ultrastructural observations on 'foam cells' and the source of their lipid in verruciform xanthoma. Verruciform xanthomas occur on mucocutaneous surfaces and are characterized by hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and the occurrence of ""foam cells"" stuffed with lipid surrounding capillaries in the dermis between rete pegs. Ultrastructural examination of a lesion on the penis revealed the presence of melanocytes with many lipid droplets in the basal layer of the epidermis. We suggest that they are a major source of the lipid of the ""foam cells."" However, this study provides no information as to the nature or lineage of the ""foam cells."".",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Langerhans cells but not monocytes are capable of antigen presentation in vitro in corticosteroid contact hypersensitivity. Corticosteroids suppress delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions in vivo and impair lymphoid cell functions in vitro. In contact hypersensitivity (CHS) to corticosteroids, however, the corticosteroids are capable of inducing DTH responses in vivo. The present study examined the capacity of corticosteroids to induce in vitro proliferation of T lymphocytes from patients with CHS to corticosteroids. With peripheral blood mononuclear adherent cells as antigen-presenting cells (APC) and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate (H-17-B) as hapten, no proliferation responses were detected of T lymphocytes from patients with CHS to H-17-B. However, when epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) were used as APC, weak proliferation responses were observed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"mRNA for tissue-type plasminogen activator is present in lesional epidermis from patients with psoriasis, pemphigus, or bullous pemphigoid, but is not detected in normal epidermis. Plasminogen activator (PA), which catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to the proteinase plasmin, has been implicated in a variety of cutaneous disorders. Lesional epidermis from patients with psoriasis, pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, and Hailey-Hailey disease contains elevated levels of tissue-type PA (tPA) activity compared to non-lesional epidermis or to epidermis from normal individuals. In the present study, we have used Northern blot analysis to demonstrate that mRNA for tPA is detectable in lesions from patients with psoriasis, pemphigus, and bullous pemphigoid, but is not detectable in normal epidermis. These data strongly suggest that the tPA enzymatic activity present in lesional epidermis results from enhanced synthesis of the enzyme in situ, secondary to elevated steady-state levels of tPA mRNA. Cultured keratinocytes likewise are shown to contain tPA mRNA. Previous investigators have suggested that the phenotypes of keratinocytes in culture, psoriatic epidermis, and epidermis in the process of wound reepithelialization are comparable. Our findings, combined with those of other investigators, suggest that elevated tPA expression may be another common feature of epidermis under these circumstances.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Effects of prednisone on human immunodeficiency virus infection. Prednisone is used to treat a number of complications of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but there is little information about the immunologic consequences of such therapy. We gave prednisone to six boys with hemophilia who were infected with HIV in order to study its effects on their clinical status, serum immunoglobulins, lymphocyte populations, and serum HIV antigen concentrations. Most patients had clinical improvement while taking prednisone; platelet counts increased in five, weight increased in four, and adenopathy abated in two patients during the study. Serum IgG concentrations declined in all patients, but there were no significant changes in serum IgA or IgM concentrations. There was no consistent or significant change in the number of percentage of CD3, CD4, CD8, or CD19 lymphocytes. HIV antigen was present in the serum of one patient, and its concentration did not change during the study. None of the patients became HIV antigen seropositive during the study. These results indicate that prednisone administration was associated with clinical improvement without deleterious immunologic effects when given to children with HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, morphea, and coexistence of both diseases. Histological studies using lectins. Histological studies using three lectins, lens culinaris agglutinin, soybean agglutinin, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I, were carried out in a case of coexistent lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and morphea, five cases of morphea, and two cases of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. The lectin staining patterns of the formaldehyde-fixed epidermis of patients with morphea were not different from those of normal epidermis, but epidermis of patients with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus showed different staining patterns. Lens culinaris agglutinin stained the basal and the spinous layers of the normal epidermis and that of patients with morphea but stained only the basal cells of the epidermis from patients with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus; epidermal Ulex europaeus agglutinin binding was observed only in the cases of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.

"Composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysm of the ascending aorta: results in 100 patients. One hundred consecutive patients with the Marfan syndrome underwent composite graft repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm between September 1976 and June 1989. Twenty-two patients had ascending aortic dissection at the time of composite graft repair; 18 patients also had a mitral valve procedure. There were no hospital deaths among 92 patients undergoing elective repair. One of 8 patients undergoing emergency repair of a ruptured aneurysm died in the operating room. The overall hospital mortality rate was 1%. There have been ten late deaths among the 99 hospital survivors (10.1%). Five deaths occurred among the first 11 patients in this series and five occurred among the last 88 patients (5.7%). Three late deaths resulted from composite graft endocarditis; 3 other patients with endocarditis are alive after aortic root replacement with cryopreserved homografts. Late coronary dehiscence caused death in 1 patient and was successfully repaired in a second. Actuarial survival for the 100 patients was 92.6% at 5 years and 75.8% at 10 years. Currently, composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysms of the ascending aorta can be performed with low hospital and late mortality.

"Hepatitis A outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit: risk factors for transmission and evidence of prolonged viral excretion among preterm infants. An outbreak of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) provided the opportunity to examine the duration of HAV excretion in infants and the mechanisms by which HAV epidemics are propagated in NICUs. The outbreak affected 13 NICU infants (20%), 22 NICU nurses (24%), 8 other staff caring for NICU infants, and 4 household contacts; 2 seropositive infants (primary cases) received blood transfusions from a donor with HAV infection. Risk factors for infection among nurses were care for a primary infant-case (relative risk [RR], 3.2), drinking beverages in the unit (odds ratio [OR], infinity), and not wearing gloves when taping an intravenous line (OR, 13.7). Among infants, risk factors were care by a nurse who cared for a primary infant-case during the same shift (RR, 6.1). Serial stool samples from infant-cases were tested for HAV antigen (HAV-Ag) by enzyme immunoassay and HAV RNA by nucleic acid amplification using the polymerase chain reaction. Infant-cases excreted HAV-Ag (n = 2) and HAV RNA (n = 3) 4-5 months after they were identified as being infected. Breaks in infection control procedures and possibly prolonged HAV shedding in infants propagated the epidemic in a critical care setting.",Virus_Diseases
"Antigenicity and accessory cell function of human articular chondrocytes. It is postulated that chondrocytes may be actively involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint diseases, presumably by providing tissue specific antigens that may initiate or sustain autoimmune reactions. To investigate whether chondrocytes may also function as accessory cells in ongoing immune processes, mixed leukocyte-chondrocyte cultures and antigen presentation assays were studied. Freshly isolated and short term cultured HLA class II antigen (Ia) negative as well as gamma-interferon treated Ia positive chondrocytes were weakly or not stimulatory to allogeneic or autologous resting lymphocytes derived from either normal donors or patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In an antigen presenting system using tetanus toxoid, the majority of chondrocyte preparations tested induced an antigen driven response in HLA matched allogeneic or autologous resting T cells which, however, was much less when compared to blood monocytes. In contrast, using activated T cells derived from tetanus toxoid specific T cell lines, an efficient antigen presenting capacity could be demonstrated in both Ia positive and initially Ia negative chondrocytes. Interestingly, the latter population had acquired Ia antigens upon incubation with the T cell line.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Human T cell lymphotropic virus types I and II in intravenous drug users in San Francisco: risk factors associated with seropositivity. Serologic assays for human T cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV I/II) infection were done in 676 intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in San Francisco between 1985 and 1987: 150 in 1985, 44 in 1986, and 482 in 1987. All sera were tested by Western blot, ELISA, and p24 RIA. A total of 111 participants were seropositive in a minimum of two assays. Duration of intravenous heroin use was strongly associated with the risk of HTLV I/II seropositivity: greater than or equal to 21 years odds ratio, 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-17.5), compared with less than 10 years of heroin use. Additional independent risk factors included black or Hispanic race, female sex, and the use of drugs in a shooting gallery. Coinfection of HTLV I/II and human immunodeficiency virus was less frequent than expected by chance (P less than .02). Longitudinal specimens were available in 154 participants.

Piroxicam-induced photosensitivity and contact sensitivity to thiosalicylic acid. A photocontact dermatitis developed in three patients after the application of gel containing 0.5% piroxicam. Patch tests were positive to thiomersal and thiosalicylic acid. Photopatch tests with piroxicam at several concentrations were positive in the three patients but negative in 62 normal volunteer subjects. Patch tests performed on 14 patients with proved systemic photosensitivity to piroxicam were positive for thiomersal and thiosalicylic acid. Nine of 12 patients previously sensitized to thiosalicylic acid and with no history of exposure to piroxicam showed positive photopatch test reactions to this chemical. These results support a relation between piroxicam-induced photosensitivity and contact sensitivity to thiosalicylic acid. Contact allergic sensitivity to the latter is a marker for patients with a high risk of developing photosensitivity reactions to piroxicam. These reactions may be due to photoproducts of the drug rather than metabolites.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Treatment of severe colitis in Behcet's syndrome with thalidomide (CG-217). A 35-year-old male patient, known in our department since 1979 on account of a severe and complete Behcet's syndrome, was treated with thalidomide (CG-217) as a final pharmacological measure to avoid colectomy during a severe attack of Behcet colitis. Prior to the administration of thalidomide, the patient had been treated for 7 weeks with full parenteral nutrition and high doses of steroids intravenously without a satisfactory effect on the colitis. Treatment with sulphasalazin was unsuccessful because of a decreasing number of platelets on this drug. After a few days on thalidomide, 300 mg given once daily at bedtime, the patient's stools were normalized and without reaction for blood, his oral ulcers and pleural effusion disappeared, and his steroid doses could be reduced. Gradually he was put on oral nutrition again, and his rectal mucosa became normalized. The dose of thalidomide was reduced to 200 mg, and then to 100 mg daily when the patient was discharged from hospital, less than 3 weeks after institution of the drug treatment. After 5 months as an out-patient his condition is still satisfactory and without symptoms of his former disease.

The average rating for pain improved from 3 points preoperatively to 8 points postoperatively for the overall group, and the average rating for function improved from 3 points preoperatively to 6 points postoperatively. Range of motion (ROM) improved substantially in patients treated with a regular glenoid component. Four patients were treated with hooded glenoid components designed to improve stability for shoulders in which the rotator cuff was deficient.

"The effects of antihistamines beyond H1 antagonism in allergic inflammation. Antigen and cold dry air were used to challenge the upper and lower airways, skin, and conjunctiva. In each of these four systems an immediate and late-phase reaction to antigen is well characterized. Although the pattern of mediator release is different in these four areas, the degree of infiltration of basophils and eosinophils in the late-phase reaction appears to be constant. Of a number of drugs that can influence these mediators and cell responses, the steroids represent a typical mode of action. Steroids block the late-phase response and ablate the eosinophil and basophil infiltration. Although the effects of antihistamines appear to be similar, they do not appear to be caused by H1 antagonism; the mechanism of their action is unknown. This discussion will focus on these non-H1 antagonist effects of antihistamines in four challenge models, particularly the upper airways and skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Immunobiological studies on the alopecic (DEBR) rat. The Dundee experimental bald rat (DEBR) has been proposed as an animal model of human alopecia areata, which is suspected of being an autoimmune disease. This study was carried out to establish whether the immunological changes observed in the lesional DEBR rat correlated with studies of human alopecia areata. The immune infiltrate was characterized using immunoperoxidase techniques on cryostat sections of vibrissa follicles. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to quantify the peripheral blood leucocytes. Some parallels were observed in the infiltration of human and DEBR rat follicles by T lymphocytes. In contrast, pre-lesional DEBR rat follicles, which are not available for investigation in human alopecia areata, were not penetrated by leucocytes and MHC class II antigens were expressed in the precortical region of the epidermal component of these follicles. Quantification of peripheral blood leucocytes showed significant increases in both T-lymphocyte subsets during lesional expression. We consider that the pre-lesional form of the rat may provide important information as a model for the pre-lesional and uninvestigated form of alopecia areata in man.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"High frequency of IL-4-producing CD4+ allergen-specific T lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis lesional skin. In atopic dermatitis (AD) hypersensitivity reactions to allergens are commonly observed and are assumed to make a major contribution in the pathomechanism of the disease. It may be expected that allergen-reactive Th cells play a central role in these reactions. In the present study the occurrence and function of allergen-specific T lymphocytes in dermal inflammatory lesions were studied. To this aim panels of randomly cloned CD4+ T cells from lesional skin biopsies of two housedust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp)-allergic AD patients were screened for reactivity with Dp allergens. The results were compared with similar tests for Dp reactivity of T-lymphocyte clones (TLC) from the peripheral blood of these patients. In the panels of TLC generated from lesional skin (S-TLC), a considerable number of TLC appeared to be Dp-specific, 47% (n = 17) and 10% (n = 29), respectively. In the panels from the peripheral blood, the percentages of Dp-specific TLC were only 0% (n = 22) and 3% (n = 34), suggesting accumulation or expansion of these T cells in lesional skin. The function of these TLC was studied by assaying the secretion of IL-4 and IFN-gamma, which have been shown to be produced in aberrant ratios by Dp-specific TLC from the peripheral blood of AD patients (Wierenga et al: J Immunol 144:4651, 1990). All Dp-specific S-TLC produced IL-4 in combination with no or low levels of IFN-gamma, whereas many of the non-Dp-specific S-TLC and blood-derived TLC (B-TLC) were observed to produce high levels of IFN-gamma without significant amounts of IL-4. A functional consequence of these cytokine profiles was demonstrated by the finding that TLC producing substantial amounts of IL-4 enhanced expression of the low-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (CD23) on antigen-presenting cells to a greater extent than did IFN-gamma-producing TLC.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Early loss of neurogenic inflammation in the human diabetic foot. 1. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by nociceptor C fibres, is part of the acute neurovascular response to injury producing the axon reflex flare. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure the flare response induced by the electrophoresis, at various current strengths, of a ring of acetylcholine solution into dorsal foot skin. 2. Nineteen control subjects and 52 long-duration insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetic patients of similar age (20 without complications; 19 with laser-treated retinopathy; 13 with reduced vibration perception and retinopathy) were studied in order to investigate the possible attenuation of this defence mechanism in diabetes. 3. The maximal (1 mA) flare response [control median (interquartile range): 1.55 (1.16-2.06) arbitrary units] was reduced greatly in neuropathic patients [0.37 (0.24-0.66) arbitrary units; P less than or equal to 0.001 with respect to all other groups], especially those with a previous history of foot ulceration. The flare was also reduced in some patients with retinopathy alone [1.06 (0.56-1.27) arbitrary units; P less than 0.005 with respect to control subjects]. 4. No rightward shift of the curve of hyperaemic response plotted against current strength was found, suggesting that the abnormal response was due to axonal loss rather than to dysfunction. 5. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by small pain fibres, was markedly impaired in a group of diabetic patients at risk of foot ulceration. Furthermore, impairment of this nociceptor C fibre response can develop before clinical large-fibre neuropathy and could itself predispose to foot complications.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Class II-restricted T cell responses in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease. IV. Identification of an immunodominant T cell determinant on the N-terminal end of the VP2 capsid protein in susceptible SJL/J mice. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease serves as a relevant animal model of human multiple sclerosis. Myelin damage induced by TMEV infection appears to be immune mediated. Disease susceptibility correlates best with the temporal development of chronic, high levels of TMEV-specific, MHC class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. We have proposed a model wherein these responses result in CNS demyelination via a macrophage-mediated terminal nonspecific bystander response. As virus-specific DTH responses appear to be intimately involved in the pathogenicity of CNS demyelination, it is critical to determine the specificity of these responses so that effector T cells specific for potential pathogenic epitopes can be targeted to serve as the focus of specific immunoregulatory processes. In the current study, the capsid protein specificity of the TMEV-susceptible SJL/J and TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 mouse strains was examined. DTH and Tprlf responses in both infected and immunized SJL/J mice were found to be predominantly directed toward the VP2 capsid protein, specifically to an epitope(s) contained within the N-terminal 150 amino acids of VP2. This same epitope was also found to be dominant in priming SJL/J mice for responses to challenge with intact virions. In contrast, the T cell-mediated responses of TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 mice did not show preferential reactivity towards VP2, because all three major capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) elicited responses with essentially equal potency. The relationship of the restricted VP2 T cell epitope to predicted neutralizing antibody sites on the VP2 protein is discussed as is the potential use of this epitope for prevention and/or treatment of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease via the induction of epitope-specific tolerance.",Virus_Diseases

"HIV-1 infection of lung alveolar fibroblasts and macrophages in humans. We have studied the infected cell populations in the lungs of four human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive patients suffering from lymphocytic alveolitis or lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. Adherent cells were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and were analyzed by various technical approaches. The cells considered here were alveolar macrophages and fibroblasts, and could be clearly identified morphologically and by the expression of specific cell-surface markers using monoclonal antibodies. The presence of HIV-1 in both of these cell types was established by serological, virological, and molecular procedures. Our results show that alveolar macrophages and fibroblasts are naturally infected in the lungs of HIV+ patients. Both cell types express the CD4 receptor molecule, in contrast to skin fibroblasts which are negative. Alveolar macrophages and fibroblasts thus may act as eventual HIV-1 reservoirs in vivo, and are probably involved in the induction of inflammatory reactions because they are targets for CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).",Virus_Diseases
"Erythropoietic protoporphyria: unusual skin and neurological problems after liver transplantation. The case of a woman with protoporphyria who developed liver failure and underwent liver transplantation is described. During the pretransplant episode of liver failure she developed quadriparesis that rapidly progressed after transplantation to a severe polyneuropathy. Following transplantation she also developed a second-degree burn of the light-exposed abdominal wall. The neuropathy resembled that observed in other forms of porphyria, and it is proposed that the extreme disturbance of protoporphyrin levels associated with protoporphyrin-induced liver failure caused this neuropathy. Such a neuropathy has not previously been described in protoporphyria. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels remain high and fecal levels normal, although results of liver tests are normal.

"Studies on the contact sensitizing activity of dithranol (anthralin) and 10-butyryl dithranol (butantrone). The contact sensitizing activity of dithranol and butantrone (10-butyryl dithranol) was studied in 3 animal models: the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT), the closed patch test (CPT), and the mouse ear swelling test (MEST) in 2 different mouse strains. In the GPMT, both dithranol and, to a greater extent, butantrone showed sensitizing potential. Because butantrone was less irritant, the concentrations used were 10x higher than those of dithranol. In the CPT, only butantrone was slightly positive. In the MEST, with both CF-1 and Balb/c mice, dithranol caused less swelling of the test ear after challenge than butantrone. According to the evaluation criteria of the MEST, only butantrone caused sensitization in 50% of the CF-1 mice and in 40% of the Balb/c mice. Thus, the GPMT was the only test which indicated the minor contact sensitizing potential of dithranol. On the other hand, the 10-butyryl analogue of dithranol showed undoubtedly stronger contact sensitizing potential than the parent compound in all tests. Therefore, as compared to dithranol, an increased risk of sensitization should be considered.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Azathioprine sodium has been reported to be effective therapy for chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE) but rarely for chronic cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LV). We used azathioprine in the treatment of six patients with cutaneous LE, four of whom had subacute cutaneous (nonscarring) LE and two of whom had chronic cutaneous (scarring, discoid) LE, and six patients with chronic cutaneous LV. The conditions of all patients had been resistant to conventional therapy, and they required long-term oral corticosteroid therapy for control of their disease. Two of the patients with LE had prominent palmar and/or plantar involvement. Three patients with LE had an excellent response to azathioprine, with near complete clearing of the skin lesions, allowing a decrease in prednisone dosage. One patient with LE initially demonstrated significant improvement, but azathioprine therapy had to be discontinued because of pancreatitis. The treatment failed in two patients with LE; one had nausea and the other repeatedly developed a drug-induced fever. Five of the six patients with LV had improved conditions, with complete control of the disease occurring in two patients and partial control in three patients.

"Fine structure of active and healed duodenal ulcer. In order to characterize the fine structure of active and healed duodenal ulcers, we examined tissue specimens of patients with active duodenal ulcer disease (n = 30) before and after treatment with either antacids (n = 16) or H2-receptor antagonists (n = 14), by light microscopy and various electron microscopic techniques, e.g., scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The characteristic histological feature of both the active and healed duodenal ulcer was the appearance of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive epithelial cells at the edge of the ulcers. Electron microscopy revealed that these cells were similar to a special type of mucus-secreting cell in the antrum (surface mucous cell). Their mucus granules contained mainly neutral glycoproteins. Helicobacter pylori were found attached to these cells in tissue specimens from 12 of 30 patients (40%). The mucous structure destroyed during the ulcerative phase regained its normal net-like structure after treatment. The ultrastructural healing process of duodenal ulcer was characterized by the presence of gastric metaplasia, by stunted microvilli of the duodenal epithelium (p less than 0.001 vs. control group), and an increased number of lysosome-like bodies (p less than 0.001 vs. control group) of the epithelial cells.

To study HTLV-I behaviour following HIV-1 infection, we superinfected cells from two HTLV-I transformed cell lines with HIV-1 (strain IIIB). Viral RNA analysis indicated that HTLV-I expression in the doubly infected cells was moderately enhanced. Moreover, CAT assays in HTLV-I transformed cells transiently transfected with HTLV-I LTR-CAT disclosed higher activity in the HIV-1 superinfected cultures.

"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-associated myelopathy and primary sclerosing cholangitis. We report the first case of human T-lymphotropic type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) linked with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The patient, a 44-year-old woman, also suffered from ulcerative colitis and polyarthritis. Two years and nine months after the clinical onset of PSC, the coexistence of HAM was shown by neurological manifestations characterized by slowly progressive symmetrical myelopathy, predominantly involving pyramidal tracts, and positive antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 in serum as well as in cerebrospinal fluid.",Virus_Diseases
"Prevalence and characteristics of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies in localized scleroderma. Comparison with systemic lupus erythematosus. Prevalence, levels, and immunoglobulin classes of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 52 patients with localized scleroderma (33 with morphea, four with generalized morphea, and 15 with linear scleroderma), in 60 healthy controls, and, for comparison, in 31 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Localized scleroderma revealed a significant prevalence of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies, mainly characterized by high levels and IgM and IgA isotypes. Comparison of antibody characteristics in different clinical forms of localized scleroderma showed some significant differences (levels and immunoglobulin isotypes). Comparison with systemic lupus erythematosus showed that frequency, high levels, and IgG isotype of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies significantly prevailed in systemic lupus erythematosus, while the IgM isotype significantly prevailed in localized scleroderma. However, generalized morphea and linear scleroderma did not significantly differ from systemic lupus erythematosus as regards antibody frequency and prevalence of high antibody levels.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Nutritional support of patients with AIDS. Investigators are now predicting that nearly 100% of the estimated 12 million HIV-positive persons in the world will develop AIDS. Most persons with AIDS will experience progressive weight loss and malnutrition prior to death. Because nutritional therapy clearly has a beneficial effect on the clinical course and immunologic status of the critically ill general population, one must not disregard its potential for benefits in the treatment of persons with AIDS. As a result of the escalating cost of medical therapy and the inevitable AIDS epidemic, the nutritional management of persons with AIDS must be simple to administer and cost effective. The author has developed nutritional screening criteria to identify those patients who would most benefit from nutritional therapy. Because these patients differ in their nutritional requirements, diet tolerance, and degree of gut dysfunction, there is no single nutritional therapy that can be used routinely to treat all malnourished persons with AIDS.",Virus_Diseases
"Anti-RNA polymerase I antibodies in the urine of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Urine samples from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n = 80), patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 36) were analyzed by radio-immunoassay (RIA) for anti-RNA polymerase I (RPI) antibodies. Significant levels of anti-RPI antibodies were detected in the urine of 46% of the patients with SLE but in only 19% of the patients with RA and in no sample from healthy individuals. The presence of anti-RPI antibodies in the urine was confirmed by demonstrating that IgG purified from the urine of patients with SLE was capable of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of RPI in vitro. If the quantity of anti-RPI antibodies excreted is related to disease activity, analysis of urine for these antibodies may be a useful alternative for the purpose of monitoring the progression of disease in individuals with SLE because of the ease by which the sample can be collected.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Decreased level of ceramides in stratum corneum of atopic dermatitis: an etiologic factor in atopic dry skin? Stratum corneum lipids are an important determinant for both water-retention function and permeability-barrier function in the stratum corneum. However, their major constituent, ceramides, have not been analyzed in detail in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis that show defective water-retention and permeability-barrier function. In an attempt to assess the quantity of ceramides per unit mass of the stratum corneum in atopic dermatitis, stratum corneum sheet was removed from the forearm skin by stripping with cyanoacrylate resin and placed in hexane/ethanol extraction to yield stratum corneum lipids. The stratum corneum was dispersed by solubilization of cyanoacrylate resin with dimethylformamide, and after membrane filtration, the weight of the stratum corneum mass was measured. The ceramides were quantified by thin-layer chromatography and evaluated as microgram/mg stratum corneum. In the forearm skin of healthy individuals (n = 65), the total ceramide content significantly declined with increasing age. In atopic dermatitis (n = 32-35), there was a marked reduction in the amount of ceramides in the lesional forearm skin compared with those of healthy individuals of the same age. Interestingly, the non-lesional skin also exhibited a similar and significant decrease of ceramides. Among six ceramide fractions, ceramide 1 was most significantly reduced in both lesional and non-lesional skin. These findings suggest that an insufficiency of ceramides in the stratum corneum is an etiologic factor in atopic dry skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Analysis of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase protein and kinetics in mucopolysaccharidosis type VI patients. A sensitive and specific, monoclonal antibody-based immunoquantification assay has facilitated determination of the N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (4-sulfatase) protein content in cultured fibroblasts from normal controls and mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) patients. The assay enabled the quantification of 4-sulfatase protein by using a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies and has shown that fibroblasts from 16 MPS VI patients contained less than or equal to 5% of the level determined for normal controls. Fibroblasts from the most severely affected patients contained the lowest levels of 4-sulfatase protein, usually with few epitopes detected, while fibroblasts from mildly affected patients had higher levels of 4-sulfatase protein, with all seven epitopes detected. The pattern of epitope expression is proposed to reflect the conformational changes in the 4-sulfatase protein that arise from different mutations in the 4-sulfatase gene. Immunoquantification in combination with a specific and highly sensitive 4-sulfated trisaccharide-based assay of enzyme activity in these MPS VI patient fibroblasts enabled the determination of residual 4-sulfatase catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). The capacity of fibroblasts to degrade substrate (catalytic capacity) was calculated as the product of 4-sulfatase catalytic efficiency and the content of 4-sulfatase in fibroblasts. One patient, 2357, with no clinical signs of MPS VI but with reduced 4-sulfatase activity and protein (both 5% of normal) and dermatansulfaturia, had 5% of normal catalytic capacity. The other 15 MPS VI patient fibroblasts had 0%-1.4% of the catalytic capacity of fibroblasts from normal controls and were representative of the spectrum of MPS VI clinical phenotypes, from severe to mild.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Lichen planus and mesalazine. Lichen planus is a recognized complication of sulfasalazine therapy. Two patients developed typical oral and cutaneous lichen planus on sulfasalazine and their skin lesions recurred when they were subsequently changed to mesalazine. Lichen planus only resolved on withdrawal of both drugs. It seems likely that the aminosalicylic acid moiety is responsible for this reaction and that lichen planus is a true complication of mesalazine therapy.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Biological and biochemical characterization of a factor produced spontaneously by adherent cells of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients inhibiting interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (Tac) expression on normal T cells. Adherent cells from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects but not from normal blood donors, patients with Gram-positive or -negative bacteremia, active tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, pulmonary aspergillosis, and cytomegalovirus infection produce spontaneously an activity which inhibits alpha chain of interleukin-2 (Tac) expression and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production by normal activated T cells and IL-2 production by these cells. A similar biologic activity was detected in culture supernatants of in vitro HIV-I-infected normal adherent and leukemic U937 cells. Tac-inhibitory activity is not cytotoxic and it could be detected in serum-free conditioned media. Recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and phorbol myristate acetate stimulation of patients' and normal adherent cells did not enhance specifically the production of the Tac inhibitor. Biologically active conditioned media did not contain infectious virus as well as secreted p24, gp120 viral proteins; the biologic activity could not be abolished by anti-p24, anti-gp120, and anti-nef monoclonal antibodies or human purified polyclonal anti-HIV IgG. Gel filtration of conditioned media followed by anion exchange chromatography resulted in a 1,200-fold degree of purification and revealed that the biologically active molecule was cationic. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this fraction and gel elution of the proteins showed that the biologic activity was associated with a 29-kD protein which was distinct from alpha- or gamma-interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E2. The above findings demonstrate the production of inhibitory factor(s) during HIV infection, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of the patients' immune defect.",Virus_Diseases
"Serum hyaluronate level as a predictor of radiologic progression in early rheumatoid arthritis. Increased serum levels of hyaluronate (HA) have been found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This probably reflects increased leakage of HA from the inflamed joints into the circulation. In a prospective study of 40 patients with early RA, we evaluated the relationship of serum HA to clinical, laboratory, and radiologic parameters of disease activity. The patients were followed for 12 months; all had active disease at study entry. We confirmed the previous finding of higher serum HA concentrations in RA patients compared with healthy controls. At study entry, the patients' serum HA levels correlated positively with clinical and laboratory parameters of acute inflammation. Despite marked clinical improvement during therapy with second-line drugs, the serum HA levels increased during the followup period. At the end of 1 year, these levels correlated with the radiologic progression of joint lesions, whereas they showed a less pronounced correlation with clinical or laboratory parameters of inflammation. We conclude that, in early RA, serum HA levels may reflect ongoing joint destruction and may even predict subsequent joint damage.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Abnormal differentiation of human papillomavirus-induced laryngeal papillomas. We studied the proliferation and differentiation of human laryngeal papillomas, which are benign tumors induced by human papillomaviruses. Immunofluorescent stains of tissues for a number of differentiation-specific proteins showed abnormal differentiation. Papilloma tissue fragments in vitro showed a slightly decreased fraction of proliferating cells that incorporated tritiated thymidine and a markedly reduced incorporation of tritiated uridine when compared with normal tissue. We propose that papillomavirus infection results in normal basal cell proliferation but abnormal terminal differentiation and that this abnormality significantly contributes to the hyperplasia of the papillomas.",Virus_Diseases
"Estimation of serum V kappa IIIb light chains in rheumatoid arthritis and correlation with CD5-positive B-cells. The presence of V kappa IIIb light chains in the sera of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients has been evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). V kappa IIIb light chains have been confirmed to be largely restricted to IgM, and were rarely detected in the IgG fraction of sera. The concentration of total serum V kappa IIIb did not significantly vary with age, nor did it correlate with IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) titre. Although total serum V kappa IIIb was not significantly increased in RA patients compared with matched controls, IgM-RFs frequently contained V kappa IIIb. Using flow cytometry, CD5-positive B-cells were not increased in these RA patients compared with healthy laboratory control personnel. Furthermore, there was no direct correlation between total serum IgM V kappa IIIb content and CD5-positive B-cell numbers in peripheral blood.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

According to HLA typing and clinical findings, of which a part was collected by followup, the patients fell into 5 groups: HLA-B27 related diseases, putative psoriatic arthritis, putative juvenile chronic polyarthritis, and seropositive and seronegative RA. Our results indicate that most of the patients with seronegative RA had some other disease. In the remaining cases the presence of rheumatoid factors had not been examined adequately, especially at the early phase of disease.

"Morphologic comparison of patients with mitral valve prolapse who died suddenly with patients who died from severe valvular dysfunction or other conditions. Clinical and necropsy findings are described in 56 patients with mitral valve prolapse: 15 patients, aged 16 to 69 years (mean 39), died suddenly and mitral valve prolapse was the only cardiac condition found at necropsy (hereafter called isolated mitral valve prolapse); the remaining 41 patients had other conditions that were capable of being fatal. Of the latter 41 patients, 7, aged 17 to 59 years (mean 45), had associated congenital heart disease, and 34 patients, aged 17 to 70 years (mean 52), had no associated congenital cardiac abnormalities. Compared with the 34 patients without associated congenital heart disease and with nonmitral valve prolapse conditions capable in themselves of being fatal, the 15 patients who died suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse were younger (mean age 39 +/- 17 versus 52 +/- 15 years; p = 0.01), more often women (67% versus 26%; p = 0.008) and had a lower frequency of mitral regurgitation (7% versus 38%; p = 0.02). The 15 patients dying suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse also were less likely to have evidence of ruptured chordae tendineae (29% versus 67%; p = 0.04). The frequency of increased heart weight (67% versus 59%), a dilated mitral valve anulus (80% versus 81%), a dilated tricuspid valve anulus (17% versus 17%), an elongated anterior mitral leaflet (86% versus 54%), an elongated posterior mitral leaflet (79% versus 77%) and fibrous endocardial plaque under the posterior mitral leaflet (73% versus 63%) was similar between the two groups. The severity of the prolapse (mild 20% versus 11%; moderate 27% versus 58%; severe 53% versus 32%) also was similar between the two groups. Thus, persons with mitral valve prolapse dying suddenly without another recognized condition tend to be relatively young women without mitral regurgitation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Enhancement of erythrocytic adenosine deaminase following treatment of AIDS-related complex/AIDS patients with zidovudine. The levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA) were determined in the erythrocytes of 10 patients with sexually transmitted HIV-1 infection [five cases with AIDS-related complex (ARC) and five with AIDS] before and after therapy with zidovudine (azidothymidine; AZT). A linear increase in ADA activity was observed during the second and third months of zidovudine treatment, with a final increase of about threefold after 3 months of drug administration. The concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was significantly lower in the erythrocytes of the same group of patients with respect to healthy controls, and a further decrease was noted after 3 months of zidovudine treatment. The results obtained indicate that treatment of ARC/AIDS subjects with zidovudine induces metabolic changes which could be responsible for the development of anaemia, an adverse effect frequently associated with zidovudine therapy.",Virus_Diseases
"Measuring vibration sensations with graduated tuning fork. Simple and reliable means to detect diabetic patients at risk of neuropathic foot ulceration. To find a simple and reliable means to measure vibration sensations, 189 diabetic patients and 88 control subjects were tested at different sites with a graduated tuning fork. Within-test variation at big toes reached 8.4% in diabetic patients vs. 2.2% in control subjects. Mean contralateral variation was 7.5% in diabetic patients vs. 2.5% in control subjects. Tuning-fork sensations were inversely correlated with duration of diabetes, whereas no correlation was found with HBA1c levels or the severity of retinopathy. Ninety-nine (52%) patients had vibratory sensation at big toes of less than 99th percentile of normal values for age. In addition, 51% of the patients with clinical symptoms at extremities (n = 67), 70% of the patients without tendon reflexes (n = 50), and 75% of the patients with abnormal nerve conduction velocities (n = 60) also had low vibration sensations. All patients with lower-limb injuries (n = 7) had values at big toes of less than 2. Altogether, the graduated tuning fork represents a simple and reliable alternative to quantitate vibration sensations. Long-term follow-up of asymptomatic patients will indicate whether these abnormalities reflect underlying neuropathy.

"Esophageal involvement in mixed connective tissue disease. A study of esophageal symptoms and function was performed in 21 patients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Esophageal involvement was found in 18 cases (85%), in 14 (66%) with typical symptoms, in 15 (71%) with manometric abnormalities and in 11 (57%) with both. The manometric pattern was characterized by reduction of amplitude and coordination of peristaltic waves throughout the esophageal body and reduction of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) competency. In comparison, 38 patients with systemic sclerosis showed a similar but more severe pattern, particularly at the level of the distal esophagus and LES. Thus, although similar, the esophageal involvement in MCTD was not exactly the same as that of systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, in MCTD a correlation between manometric abnormalities and cutaneous involvement was lacking, and this suggests that esophageal disorders are not always linked with clinically evident scleroderma-like features of this disease. Since the diagnosis of MCTD is made in the presence of the clinical picture of more than one connective tissue disease, the detection of esophageal involvement by a sensitive technique such as esophageal manometry in a patient with suspected MCTD may be a useful diagnostic aid.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Neonatal adenovirus infection: four patients and review of the literature. Four newborns with adenovirus infection are described, and the profile of neonatal adenovirus disease is outlined based on the cases of these newborns and nine previously described. Characteristic historical features included prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal illness, vaginal delivery, and onset of illness within the first 10 days of life. Clinical findings included lethargy, fever or hypothermia, anorexia, apnea, hepatomegaly, bleeding, and progressive pneumonia. Thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and hepatitis were typical laboratory manifestations. Illness was severe and generally unremitting; only two survivors have been reported. Pathologic changes were prominent in lung, liver, and brain. Virus isolates, predominantly serotypes 3, 7, 21, and 30 were obtained from multiple sites and organs. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that viral acquisition from the mother, perhaps via the birth canal, is a major mode of transmission. Neonatal adenovirus infection, which is frequently disseminated and generally fatal, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia.",Virus_Diseases
"Sunscreen protection against UVB, UVA and blue light: an in vivo and in vitro comparison. The photoprotection against UVB, UVA and blue light provided by a widely prescribed sunscreen (RoC 15+ A+B) was compared with two new products containing microfine titanium dioxide (Sun E45 lotion SPF 15 and Sun E45 cream SPF 20). Comparisons were made in vivo using photosensitive patients with either chronic actinic dermatitis or erythropoietic protoporphyria, and in vitro using a newly developed spectrophotometric assay. Good agreement was obtained between the in-vivo and in-vitro methods at each waveband. All products showed high protection against UVB radiation, but the products containing microfine titanium dioxide showed significantly higher protection against both UVA and blue light than RoC 15+ A+B. Products containing microfine titanium dioxide are likely to offer superior photoprotection in those patients who are abnormally sensitive to long wavelength ultraviolet radiation than products which are currently available on prescription.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Fifteen male homosexual subjects (mean age 31.6 +/- 7.2 yr) who were asymptomatic, but HIV-1 seropositive (HIV+) were compared to 15 male age-matched HIV-1 seronegative (HIV-) subjects using resting PET/FDG studies and MR scans. Mean cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (mg/100 g/min) in the HIV+ and HIV- subjects were 7.7 +/- 1.7 and 7.0 +/- 2.1, (p = 0.44), respectively. An index of regional metabolic asymmetry for the whole brain was 5.8% +/- 3.2% in the HIV+ and 2.7% +/- 2.3% in the HIV- (p = 0.002), and the difference was most prominent in the prefrontal area. Significant asymmetries were found in 10/15 HIV+ subjects, primarily in prefrontal (7/15) and premotor (4/15) regions.

"Comparison of adverse reactions to whole-virion and split-virion influenza vaccines in hospital personnel. OBJECTIVE: To compare the adverse effects, particularly generalized aching, of a trivalent, inactivated whole-virion vaccine (WVV) and split-virion vaccine (SVV) for influenza in hospital personnel. DESIGN: Recipient-blinded study; first-time vaccinees were randomly assigned to receive either of the vaccines from one manufacturer in the 1989-90 influenza season. Subjects were asked to complete a symptom questionnaire during the 48 hours after immunization. SETTING: Annual influenza program for staff of a tertiary care children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteers were sought among approximately 2200 members of the hospital staff. Of the 358 vaccinated for the first time, 333 (93%) returned the questionnaire. RESULTS: During the 48 hours after vaccination 13% of the SVV recipients reported generalized aching, as compared with 26% of the WVV recipients (p less than 0.01). Also, the SVV group reported fewer visible local reactions and more transient arm soreness, but the actual differences between the two groups were small. The occurrence of mild symptoms was equally common in the two groups (local reactions in at least 70% of cases, systemic reactions in at least 33%). In each group 1% of the subjects reported missing work because of the vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The use of SVV reduces the rate of the most objectionable of the common adverse effects of influenza vaccination. Therefore, as with children, it might be more acceptable to health care workers than the current use of WVV.",Virus_Diseases
"A controlled trial of aerosolized ribavirin in infants receiving mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection  BACKGROUND. Although the antiviral agent ribavirin improves the course of lower respiratory tract disease in spontaneously breathing infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection, it is not known whether ribavirin can benefit infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus disease who require mechanical ventilation. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of ribavirin (20 mg per milliliter) administered continuously in aerosolized form to infants receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure that was caused by documented respiratory syncytial virus infection. RESULTS. Of the 28 infants (mean [+/- SD] age, 1.4 +/- 1.7 months) enrolled, 7 had underlying diseases predisposing them to severe infection (mean age, 3.0 +/- 2.6 months), and 21 were previously normal (mean age, 0.8 +/- 0.9 month). Among the 14 infants who received ribavirin, the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 4.9 days (as compared with 9.9 days among the 14 who received placebo; P = 0.01), and the mean length of supplemental oxygen use was 8.7 days (as compared with 13.5 days; P = 0.01). The mean length of the hospital stay was 13.3 days after treatment with ribavirin and 15.0 with placebo (P = 0.04). When only the 21 previously normal infants were considered, the mean length of the hospital stay was 9.0 days for the ribavirin recipients and 15.3 days for those who received placebo (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS. In infants who require mechanical ventilation because of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, treatment with aerosolized ribavirin decreases the duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen treatment, and the hospital stay.",Virus_Diseases
"Detection of human papillomavirus DNA on routine Papanicolaou's smears by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated probes. Specific human papillomavirus (HPV) types have been implicated as playing a major role in the development of cervical neoplasias. HPV DNA types usually have been identified by nucleic acid hybridization assays with the use of radiolabeled probes. These techniques are sensitive and specific but are not suitable for large-scale clinical use. To detect specific HPV DNAs simply and rapidly, in situ hybridization (ISH) with the use of biotinylated HPV DNA 6/11 and 16/18 probes was done on destained Papanicolaou's (Pap) smears from 545 patients. All smears showed koilocytotic changes. HPV DNAs were demonstrated not only in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and atypia, but also in squamous cells with minimal nuclear changes (karyomegaly) and perinuclear halos. HPV DNA 16/18 was detected in 52% of the smears with CIN I, 44% of those with CIN II and III, 19% of those with atypia, and 4% of the minimal changes. HPV DNA 6/11 was detected in 27% of the smears with CIN I, 27% of those with atypia, and 6% of the minimal changes. HPV DNAs were also detected in smears without koilocytotic changes. Thus, ISH with the use of biotinylated probes can serve as an adjunct to Pap smears in detecting HPV infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Elevated plasma levels of hyaluronate in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Plasma levels of hyaluronate (HA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with osteoarthritis (OA), measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were compared with levels in a healthy, age-matched non-arthritic control group, in a retrospective study. Compared with the controls, the mean level of plasma HA was sevenfold higher in the RA group and twofold higher in the OA group. There was no statistically significant correlation between HA levels and 7 other clinical and biochemical parameters in patients with RA. In the OA group, however, plasma HA levels were found to correlate with an objective functional capacity score and with an articular index based on the total amount of cartilage in involved joints. In a retrospective longitudinal study of 6 patients with RA, plasma levels of HA did not show a significant correlation with plasma levels of elastase or with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These data support in part the contention that plasma HA may be unique as a marker, in that it may be a reflection of synovial involvement and inflammation, rather than only of inflammation, in arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Lymphocyte transformation and thiuram sensitization. The use of a lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) to confirm allergic contact dermatitis from thiurams has been investigated. The responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from thiuram-sensitive and non-sensitive individuals following culture with dimethylcarbamoyl-protein (human serum albumin; HSA) and dimethylthiocarbamoyl-HSA conjugates has been compared. Only PBMC from those patients who were patch-test-positive with thiuram-mix and sensitized to tetramethylthiuram monosulphide (TMTM) or TMTM and tetramethylthiuram disulphide (TMTD) exhibited significant proliferative responses to these conjugates. Thiuram-patch-test-negative patients and control donors with no history of allergic contact dermatitis failed to mount a significant response to any concentration of either conjugate. Two of the thiuram-sensitive patients were also nickel-patch-test-positive, and PBMC isolated from these donors, but not from nickel-patch-test-negative patients, proved positive in a nickel LTT. The data reveal that relevant hapten-protein conjugates are capable of provoking specific human lymphocyte proliferative responses in vitro, and that, using this technique, the LTT can, in principle, be used for the investigation and/or diagnosis of skin sensitization to lipophilic contact allergens.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"CD36(OKM5)+ dendritic cells in the oral mucosa of HIV- and HIV+ subjects. In this study, we have investigated by light and electron microscopy the presence, distribution, and inner structure of CD36(OKM5)+ dendritic cells (DC) in the lamina propria and epithelium of the oral mucosa of HIV- and HIV+ subjects; in the latter, both clinically healthy areas and areas of hairy leukoplakia (HL) were studied. Perivascular CD36+ DC were present in the lamina propria of all the specimens studied. They were also found in small numbers in the epithelium of clinically healthy mucosa of HIV- and HIV+ subjects, but were practically absent from the epithelium of HL. CD36+ DC seemed to be regularly HLA-DR+ in HIV-subjects; this positivity was recognized only in some cells in the clinically healthy mucosa of HIV+ subjects, and practically never in HL. Because the only perivascular cells observed in the clinically healthy areas of HIV+ subjects were CD36+, we investigated the ultrastructure of perivascular DC in these same areas. These cells were characterized by the presence of a prominent Golgi apparatus, many lysosomes, and focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix. It may be concluded that 1) CD36+ DC are physiologic components of the oral mucosa, 2) they share some ultrastructural features with macrophages, 3) no differences in numbers were found between HIV+ and HIV- subjects, and 4) these cells are affected in their expression of HLA-DR antigens during HIV infection, particularly in areas of HL. This may be a hint that the antigen-presenting function of these cells in the oral mucosa is negatively affected during HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Ultrasonic surgical aspiration in the treatment of vulvar disease. Ultrasonic surgical aspiration is a useful technique for safe and accurate tissue removal. This study was conducted to evaluate its role in noninvasive vulvar disease.

All surgical procedures were done under general anesthesia, with two patients requiring hospitalization for perineal care and pain control after extensive vulvar surgery. Recurrent or persistent disease occurred in four patients with condylomata acuminata and in two with VIN, with a mean follow-up of 50 weeks. Reepithelialization was completed within 5 weeks and no patients developed vulvar scarring. Adequate samples for histopathologic review were obtained in 26 patients.

"Depletion of muscle mitochondrial DNA in AIDS patients with zidovudine-induced myopathy. Long-term zidovudine therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can cause a destructive mitochondrial myopathy with histological features of ragged-red fibres (RRF) and proliferation of abnormal mitochondria. In 9 zidovudine-treated patients with this myopathy we found severely reduced amounts (up to 78% reduction vs normal adult controls) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in muscle biopsy specimens by means of Southern blotting. In 2 HIV-positive patients who had not received zidovudine, muscle mtDNA content did not differ from that in the 4 controls. Depletion of mtDNA seems to be reversible, since 1 patient showed a substantial reduction in RRF and a concomitant pronounced increase in muscle mtDNA content after zidovudine therapy was discontinued.

The specificity and sensitivity of two commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), Diamedix (Miami, Florida) and Lipogen (Noxville, Tennessee), were assessed and compared with haemagglutination and immunodiffusion assays. Sera from 53 patients with various connective tissue disorders were examined for the presence of antibodies to nuclear antigens (ANA), double stranded DNA (dsDNA), Sm, RNP, SSA/Ro, and SSB/La. Of the 53 patients, 42 were ANA positive, 11 were ANA negative, and 22 had antibodies to dsDNA. Seven patients had antibodies to Sm by haemagglutination assay; these were also positive in both ELISA systems (only five of the seven patients were assayed by the Lipogen ELISA system). Two additional Sm positive values were obtained in each of the ELISA systems but only one of these was positive in both. Ten positive RNP results were obtained by haemagglutination and nine of these were also positive by the Diamedix ELISA. Only eight samples were tested by the Lipogen assay and seven of these were positive. Three additional RNP positive values were obtained by the Diamedix and six by the Lipogen ELISA assays. Of these, only two were positive in both. Antibodies to SSA/Ro were obtained in 11 patients by immunodiffusion and lines of partial identity were observed in nine. SSB/La antibodies were positive in six patients and two had lines of partial identity. All the SSA/Ro and SSB/La positive sera were also positive in both ELISA systems. Moreover, eight additional SSA/Ro positive values were obtained in each of the ELISAs, four of which had partial identity lines in the immunodiffusion assay. Furthermore, three additional SSB/La positive values were obtained by the Diamedix and four by the Lipogen assays. Of these, only two were positive in both ELISAs. This study shows that the above ELISAs are comparable in specificity and sensitivity with haemagglutination assay for detection of antibodies to Sm and RNP antigens and are more sensitive than immunodiffusion for the detection of SSA/Ro and SSB/La antigens.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evaluation of antibodies to hepatitis C virus in a study of transfusion-associated hepatitis. BACKGROUND. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is now known to be the chief cause of transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis, but the prevalence of HCV among blood donors and the frequency of transmission by blood transfusion are unknown. METHODS. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of a test for antibody to HCV, we tested serum samples from participants in a large study of transfusion-associated hepatitis. Samples were obtained prospectively from consecutive adults undergoing open-heart surgery in Spain, but were tested retrospectively, after the antibody enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV became available. RESULTS. Of 280 transfusion recipients given a total of 1109 units of blood, 27 (9.6 percent) had transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis (mean follow-up, 52 weeks) and 24 of the 27 seroconverted to anti-HCV-positive, whereas only 2 (0.8 percent) of the remaining transfusion recipients seroconverted. Among the 1044 donor specimens available for testing, 16 (1.5 percent) had anti-HCV antibody. Only 1 additional seropositive donor was found when 44 implicated donors who had been seronegative were retested 9 to 12 months later. Of the 16 recipients of anti-HCV-positive blood, 14 (88 percent) had transfusion-associated hepatitis and seroconverted to anti-HCV-positive. The remaining two recipients had neither hepatitis nor anti-HCV antibody. Among 25 patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis for whom all transfused blood was tested, 14 had received blood positive for anti-HCV. CONCLUSIONS. About 90 percent of blood donors with antibody to HCV have infectious virus in their blood. The screening of blood donors for anti-HCV antibody should prevent about half the cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis, but the donors with infectious virus who are anti-HCV-negative may remain seronegative for prolonged periods.",Virus_Diseases
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of CD23 expression on lymphocytes in rheumatoid synovitis. The leucocyte antigen CD23 is expressed by B lymphocytes following activation by a number of stimuli and functions as an IgE receptor, and in its soluble form, as a putative B cell growth factor. The expression of CD23 on the surface of lymphocytes in paraffin wax sections of synovial biopsy specimens was studied using a novel mouse monoclonal antibody, BU38. Specimens were investigated from nine cases of rheumatoid arthritis, six cases of osteoarthritis, and eight cases of chronic inflammation in articular and non-articular tissues. CD23 was expressed on a high proportion of lymphocytes in all forms of chronic inflammation and was not specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It may be a characteristic feature of any chronic inflammatory response. As CD23 was found on the surface of lymphocytes in many cases of these arthritides, sCD23 in serum or synovial fluid may yet prove a useful marker for the severity of the inflammatory infiltrate.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Immunological studies of the basis for the apathogenicity of simian immunodeficiency virus from African green monkeys. Potential reasons for the lack of pathogenicity of the simian immunodeficiency virus SIVagm in its natural host, the African green monkey (AGM, Cercopithecus aethiops), were investigated with respect to immunological mechanisms. The functional immune response of monkeys to infection was similar (though not identical) to that of humans to infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In the sera of infected animals, neutralizing antibodies were found to be low or absent, and in particular there was no neutralization of the various isolates by homologous sera. There was no detectable antibody/complement cytotoxicity, though AGM sera were able to initiate antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis of infected cells in the presence of healthy effector peripheral blood lymphocytes. As in the human/HIV system, macrophages from AGMs are readily infected by SIVagm. Two possibly important differences between the AGM/SIVagm system and the human/HIV system are (i) the low immune response of the AGMs to the core protein of SIVagm and (ii) the significantly lower inhibitory effect of SIVagm proteins on the proliferation of AGM lymphocytes.",Virus_Diseases
"Identification of two collagen domains within the bullous pemphigoid autoantigen, BP180. Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by subepidermal vesicles and the presence of autoantibodies directed against the epidermal basement membrane zone. Previous studies have identified two protein components of the hemidesmosome, BP180 and BP230, as the primary antigenic targets of BP autoantibodies. We have recently reported the isolation of a 1.0-kb BP180 cDNA. Sequence analysis presented in this report reveals that this partial BP180 cDNA encodes two protein domains which have primary structures that are characteristic of the triple helical domains of collagens, i.e., glycine appears at every third position and over one-third of the remaining residues are proline. The two collagen domains have lengths of 242 and 30 amino acids and are separated by a noncollagen stretch of 12 amino acids. Collagenase digestion of the BP180 cDNA-encoded fusion protein generated a peptide fragment with a size that was consistent with the predicted locations of the collagenase digestion sites. A possible physiological function for the collagen domains of the BP180 hemidesmosomal protein may be to form stable interactions with constituents of the extracellular matrix of the cutaneous basement membrane zone. Such interactions may provide the molecular framework for the adhesion between the basal keratinocyte and the basal lamina.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Intractable ulcerating enterocolitis of infancy. Five children (three boys, two girls) presenting in the first year of life with intractable diarrhoea had a number of features in common. All had ulcerating stomatitis, four had partial villous atrophy on small intestinal biopsy, all had colitis characterised by large ulcers with overhanging edges, and four had severe perianal disease; no stool pathogens were detected. Treatment with steroids, sulphasalazine, and azathioprine was unsuccessful. All five required subtotal colectomy. Four were children of consanguinous marriages, two were siblings of Pakistani origin, two were cousins of Arab origin, and the fifth was Portuguese. Although the diagnoses of Behcet's disease and Crohn's disease were considered, it appears that these children represent a distinct inherited condition affecting the whole gastrointestinal tract, particularly the colon.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Improvement by acetylcysteine of hemodynamics and oxygen transport in fulminant hepatic failure. BACKGROUND. When administered early after an overdose of acetaminophen, intravenous acetylcysteine prevents hepatic necrosis by replenishing reduced stores of glutathione. How acetylcysteine improves the survival of patients with established liver damage induced by acetaminophen, however, is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether the beneficial effect of acetylcysteine under such circumstances could be due to enhancement of oxygen delivery and consumption. METHODS. We studied the effect of acetylcysteine on systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport in 12 patients with acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and 8 patients with acute liver failure from other causes. The acetylcysteine was given in a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight in 250 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 15 minutes and then in a dose of 50 mg per kilogram in 500 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 4 hours; measurements were made before treatment began and after 30 minutes of the regimen. RESULTS. In the patients with acetaminophen-induced liver failure, the infusion of acetylcysteine resulted in an increase in mean oxygen delivery from 856 to 975 ml per minute per square meter of body-surface area (P = 0.0036), due to an increase in the cardiac index from 5.6 to 6.7 liters per minute per square meter (P = 0.0021). Mean arterial pressure rose from 88 to 95 mm Hg (P = 0.0054) despite a decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1296 to 1113 dyn.sec.cm-5 per square meter (P = 0.027). There was an increase in oxygen consumption from 127 to 184 ml per minute per square meter (P = 0.0007) associated with an increase in the oxygen-extraction ratio from 16 to 21 percent (P = 0.022). The effects in the patients with acute liver failure from other causes were similar. CONCLUSIONS. The increase in oxygen delivery and consumption in response to acetylcysteine may account for its beneficial effect on survival in patients with fulminant hepatic failure induced by acetaminophen.",Virus_Diseases
"Distribution of skin-derived antileucoproteases (SKALP) in the marginal zone of the spreading psoriatic lesion. Two new elastase inhibitors (SKALP, skin-derived antileucoproteases) were recently described in the lesional skin in psoriasis. The present study investigated the distribution of SKALP activity in the marginal zone of spreading psoriatic plaques. In a 4-mm zone immediately adjacent to the erythemato-squamous plaques, SKALP activity was slightly increased compared to distant uninvolved skin. Within the lesion the anti-elastase activity was pronounced, but was significantly higher in the central zone of the plaque compared to the periphery. The appearance of SKALP in the psoriatic lesion appears to be a late event compared to endothelial involvement, intraepidermal accumulation of PMNs, epidermal proliferation and abnormal keratinization. This observation lends further support for the hypothesis that the induction of anti-elastase activity is associated with the off-switch of cutaneous inflammation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Fibronectin release by systemic sclerosis and normal dermal fibroblasts in response to TGF-beta. To determine whether enhanced matrix synthesis by systemic sclerosis (SSc) fibroblasts in vitro is due to increased responsiveness to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), fibronectin release by SSc and normal fibroblasts (7 pairs) was measured at various concentrations of TGF-beta. In the absence of TGF-beta, SSc fibroblasts released 30 +/- 22% more fibronectin than normal fibroblasts. While both SSc and normal fibroblasts increased fibronectin release at all concentrations of TGF-beta tested, the percentage increases were not statistically greater for the SSc fibroblasts even though 4 of the SSc fibroblasts strains were selectively sensitive to low concentrations of TGF-beta. TGF-beta increased cell numbers of both SSc and normal strains equally. Our data confirm abnormal regulation of fibronectin gene expression in SSc fibroblasts and suggest increased sensitivity to TGF-beta by some SSc fibroblast strains.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Virus-triggered acquired immunodeficiency by cytotoxic T-cell-dependent destruction of antigen-presenting cells and lymph follicle structure. Virus-induced acquired immune suppression in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is shown here to be caused by the CD8+-T-cell-dependent elimination of macrophages/antigen-presenting cells. Surprisingly, this is associated with severe destruction of the follicular organization of lymphoid organs, indicating a crucial role for dendritic cells and marginal zone macrophages in maintaining follicular structure. Once established, this immunopathology cannot be readily reversed by the elimination of CD8+ effector cells. Such a T-cell-mediated pathogenesis may play a pivotal role in acquired virus-induced immunosuppression and may represent one strategy by which virus escapes immune surveillance and establishes persistent infections in initially immunocompetent hosts.",Virus_Diseases
"Prevalence of HIV antibody and pregnancy in Tayside, 1984-9: background to screening. OBJECTIVE--To determine age specific prevalence of HIV antibody, incidence of pregnancy, and likelihood of detection and correct assignment to risk category by antenatal screening of women known to be positive for HIV antibody, from 1984 to 1989. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of reproductive history and risk behaviour of women positive for HIV antibody and prediction of detection by screening on the basis of blood group samples, Guthrie tests, and rubella tests. SETTING--City of Dundee, where the prevalence of HIV is high, since the appearance of HIV in 1984, predominantly among heterosexual intravenous drug users. PATIENTS--All (61) women known to be positive for HIV antibody who had had clinically indicated tests, for whom case notes were available for 60. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Risk assessment according to case notes and reported to the laboratory, incidence of infection, geographical location, age, date of positive test result, and reproductive history. RESULTS--With 61 infected women the overall minimum prevalence among women within the city of Dundee was 0.67/1000 and 2.9/1000 among women in their third decade. Of the 60 women whose reproductive history was available, 35 had 57 pregnancies, 36 of which occurred after seroconversion was known to have taken place, representing 8.7% of the total number of affected pregnancies reported for the United Kingdom. If antenatal screening for HIV had been performed between 1984 and 1989 it could not have detected positivity for HIV antibody in 25 (42%) women who had no pregnancies during this time. Among the remaining 35 women, screening samples taken for blood grouping could have identified a maximum of 34 (57%), samples taken to check rubella susceptibility a maximum of 22 (37%), and blood spots on Guthrie cards a maximum of 19 (32%). Retesting would have occurred in 14 women 33 times with samples taken for blood grouping, but three and four women would have been tested twice using samples taken for rubella testing and Guthrie cards respectively. Anonymous screening would have been unable to determine risk category as a history of intravenous drug use was known in 47 (79%) women before testing but this was increased by a further 5 (8%) who admitted to it after the test result was known. CONCLUSION--Interpreting the results of antenatal screening programmes will be complex and will underestimate overall prevalence of HIV antibody among women; this will be exaggerated by strategies based on anonymous testing with Guthrie cards or on samples taken for rubella testing, which do not include women who have had an earlier loss of pregnancy. Only open testing with consent will permit satisfactory attribution to.",Virus_Diseases

A woman first seen in 1978 had a history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of 12 years' duration with attacks of palindromic rheumatism for 3 years. She was treated with D-penicillamine, pyridoxine and hydroxychloroquine and serial measurements of her grip strength and proximal interphalangeal joint circumference were taken. By 1987 all her nodules had resorbed completely. Hydroxychloroquine effects probably helped her improvement.

"Molecular heterogeneity of acute intermittent porphyria: identification of four additional mutations resulting in the CRIM-negative subtype of the disease. Four mutations of the porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase gene that result in cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM)-negative forms of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) have been identified by in vitro amplification of cDNA from patients and by cloning of the amplified products in a bacterial expression vector. One mutation is a single base deletion which causes a frameshift and which is expected to result in the synthesis of a truncated protein. Two other mutations consist of single base substitutions and lead to amino acid changes. The fourth mutation is a single base substitution producing an aberrant splicing and resulting in an mRNA which would encode a protein missing three amino acids. DNAs from 16 unrelated CRIM-negative AIP patients were screened for the presence of these four mutations, by hybridization with oligonucleotides specific for each of the mutations, but none of the four mutations was identified in additional patients. The results indicate that mutations responsible for CRIM-negative AIP are highly heterogenous.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hunter syndrome: isolation of an iduronate-2-sulfatase cDNA clone and analysis of patient DNA. Iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS, EC 3.1.6.13) is required for the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Mutations causing IDS deficiency in humans result in the lysosomal storage of these glycosaminoglycans and Hunter syndrome, an X chromosome-linked disease. We have isolated and sequenced a 2.3-kilobase cDNA clone coding for the entire sequence of human IDS. Analysis of the deduced 550-amino acid IDS precursor sequence indicates that IDS has a 25-amino acid amino-terminal signal sequence, followed by 8 amino acids that are removed from the proprotein. An internal proteolytic cleavage occurs to produce the mature IDS present in human liver shown to contain a 42-kDa polypeptide N-terminal to a 14-kDa polypeptide. The IDS sequence has strong sequence homology with other sulfatases (such as sea urchin arylsulfatase, human arylsulfatases A, B, and C, and human glucosamine 6-sulfatase), suggesting that the sulfatases comprise an evolutionarily related family of genes that arose by gene duplication and divergent evolution. The arylsulfatases have a greater homology with each other than with the non-arylsulfatases (IDS and glucosamine 6-sulfatase). The IDS cDNA detected RNA species of 5.7, 5.4, 2.1, and 1.4 kilobases in human placental RNA and revealed structural alterations and gross deletions of the IDS gene in many of the clinically severe Hunter syndrome patients studied.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"The clinical significance of immune reactions with some streptococcal antigens in rheumatoid arthritis. The level of antibodies and delayed-type hypersensitivity to the group specific polysaccharides and cell wall proteins of groups A, B, C and G streptococci was determined in 247 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as well as in healthy persons and in patients with other articular disorders by means of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, passive hemaglutination and leukocyte migration inhibition tests. An increase of the immune response to antigens of group B streptococcus was found in patients with RA. The greatest sensitization against these antigens was typical for high disease activity of short duration, and a rapidly progressive course of RA. High titers of antibodies to polysaccharide of group B streptococcus appeared in the synovial fluid in the early stages of the clinical development of RA. Values of immune response to streptococcal antigens correlated well with the titer of rheumatoid factor and the concentration of immunoglobulins and immune complexes. The presence of group B streptococcus in the urogenital tract appeared more often in patients with RA than in healthy persons. The possibility of a triggering role for immune reactions with antigens of group B streptococcus in the immunopathological process of RA is discussed, as well as the diagnostic significance of our results.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Immunogenicity of subcutaneous versus intramuscular Oka/Merck varicella vaccination in healthy children. To compare the immunogenicity and safety of varicella vaccine by either subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, 166 healthy children aged 12 months to 10 years old who had no prior history of varicella were enrolled from two pediatric practices and randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mL of a single lot of varicella vaccine. Sera from the day of and 6 weeks postvaccination were tested for varicella antibody by gpELISA. Parents recorded clinical events occurring in the 6 weeks following vaccination. In the 132 evaluable children, the mean prevaccination titer was 0.3 gpELISA units for both groups. Sixty-three (97%) of the 65 receiving varicella vaccine by the subcutaneous route seroconverted compared with 67 (100%) of 67 immunized intramuscularly. Postvaccination geometric mean titer in the subcutaneous group was 6.9 +/- 7.0 gpELISA units and did not differ significantly from the geometric mean titer of 10.5 +/- 4.4 in the intramuscular group. Varicella vaccine was generally well tolerated by either route; 21% of both groups complained of reactions at the injection site and 7% had a varicella-like rash. Although varicella vaccine is recommended to be given subcutaneously, the results of this study indicate that inadvertent intramuscular administration of varicella vaccine is not reason for revaccination.",Virus_Diseases

"Trends in mortality among AIDS patients in Amsterdam, 1982-1988. In this study we evaluated the survival of 515 AIDS patients diagnosed in Amsterdam between 1982 and 1988 and followed-up until April 1990. Non-resident patients survived for a shorter period than resident patients (median survival time 10 versus 16 months). Residents had a 1-, 2- and 3-year survival of 56.1, 33.0 and 17.2%, respectively. Heterosexual intravenous drug users tended to have a better survival than homosexual men, although this was not significant. The survival time was longer for AIDS patients less than 30 years of age at diagnosis and varied for the different clinical manifestations leading to AIDS diagnosis. We calculated the 1- and 2-year survival probability by year of diagnosis for patients initially presenting with a Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). The 1-year survival improved greatly in 1986 and continued to rise in the following years. The 2-year survival was similar in 1986 and 1987 (26.8 versus 28.2%) but increased in 1988 (38.9%). We conclude that besides better clinical experience and diagnostic methods, this improvement in prognosis could be explained by the start of secondary prophylaxis for PCP in 1985 and the introduction of zidovudine therapy in 1987.",Virus_Diseases

A placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and prophylactic efficacy of a low dose (100 mg) of rimantadine hydrochloride against naturally occurring influenza in adults was conducted at two sites. After the onset of the influenza season, volunteers (ages, 18 to 55 years) were assigned randomly to receive rimantadine or placebo daily.

"2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin in asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals. This study examined 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2,5A) synthetase activity in 26 individuals during the asymptomatic phase of HIV infection and its correlation with neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin. In HIV-antibody-positive (HIV-Ab+) asymptomatic people, both neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin levels in sera were significantly elevated; in contrast, 2,5A-synthetase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was not significantly higher than in HIV-antibody-negative controls. The 2,5A-synthetase levels in symptomatic people (AIDS-related complex and AIDS) were significantly higher than in either asymptomatic or control individuals. However, within the group of HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals, all three markers were positively correlated. In this group, neopterin values were negatively correlated with the number of CD4+ lymphocytes while a positive correlation was found between 2,5A-synthetase and the number of CD8+ lymphocytes. Asymptomatic people with detectable serum HIV p24 antigen had significantly higher 2,5A-synthetase, neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin and number of CD8+ lymphocytes. This study suggests that elevated 2,5A-synthetase activity may reflect a different aspect of host response to HIV infection than do elevated neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin.",Virus_Diseases
"Electrolyte transport in piglets infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Stimulation by verapamil and clonidine. The effects of clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, and verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, on Na+ and Cl- absorption were studied in stripped jejunal mucosa from control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-infected piglets. All infected piglets developed severe diarrhea 18-24 hours after oral inoculation. Jejunum from infected animals, as compared with control jejunum, had decreased mucosal-to-serosal, serosal-to-mucosal, and net Na+ and Cl- fluxes. Clonidine and verapamil caused a decrease in short-circuit current and stimulation of Na+ and Cl- absorption in control jejunum. In infected piglets, although the jejunum exhibited severe villus atrophy, both drugs stimulated Na+ and Cl- absorption and the magnitude of Na+ and Cl- absorption was similar in control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. In contrast, D-glucose stimulated Na+ absorption, and the decrease in short-circuit current caused by verapamil and clonidine, were decreased in transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. Such pharmacological stimulation of Na+ and Cl- absorption might be useful in the management and treatment of certain viral diarrheal diseases.",Virus_Diseases
"Induction of CD4+, human T lymphotropic virus type-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes from patients with HAM/TSP. Recognition of an immunogenic region of the gp46 envelope glycoprotein of human T lymphotropic virus type-1. Although the humoral response to human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-I) has been well characterized in patients with HTLV-I-associated neurologic disease (HAM/TSP), little is known about a functional HTLV-I-specific human T cell response, such as CTL, in these patients. To define both the phenotype of the responding CTL and the fine specificity of this response, long term T cell lines were generated from two HAM/TSP patients who were from two different countries. Patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes were repeatedly stimulated in vitro with an HTLV-I expressing autologous T cell line. The resultant long term T cell culture was shown to be CD4+ and cytotoxic for targets expressing HTLV-I Ag. Using a panel of synthetic peptides that span hydrophilic regions of the HTLV-I gp46 envelope glycoprotein, the CTL lines generated from both patients were shown to recognize the same region of the HTLV-I envelope between amino acids 196-209 as defined by the synthetic peptide sp4a1. Interestingly, this sequence overlaps a region of HTLV-I envelope that had also been shown to elicit a strong B cell response in HAM/TSP patients (amino acids 190-203). One CTL line recognized this HTLV-I epitope in the context of HLA DQ5 whereas the other CTL line was restricted by HLA DRw16. The generation of two independent CTL lines from two HAM/TSP patients from different geographic areas that recognize the same region of the HTLV-I envelope glycoprotein highlights the immunogenic nature of this envelope region.",Virus_Diseases
"Effects of occupational therapy home service on patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Cause-specific, age-adjusted mortality rates have declined from 1950 through 1986 for cerebrovascular disease, injuries, perinatal conditions, heart disease, and influenza and pneumonia. Time trends in the proportion of persons dying of each of these diseases, however, have varied; the proportion dying of cerebrovascular disease, injuries, and perinatal conditions has decreased, and the proportion of persons dying of heart disease and influenza and pneumonia has remained fairly stable from 1950 through 1986. During this same time, age-adjusted death rates have increased for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and have remained fairly stable for malignant neoplasms, while the proportions of persons dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and malignant neoplasms have increased dramatically. For people aged 35 to 64 years, malignant neoplasms have now overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death. For those aged 65 years and older, heart disease remains the leading cause of death, accounting for almost 50% of all deaths in persons 85 years and older.",Virus_Diseases
"Ig CH and D14S1 variants in rheumatoid arthritis--linkage and association studies. We have looked for an effect of 14th chromosomal genes linked to immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgCH) or D14S1 regions on susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by both linkage (sibling pair analysis) and association studies. There was no overall linkage between RA and either IgCH or D14S1. However, Gm haplotype similarity in affected siblings appeared greater in either DR4-positive as compared to DR4-negative sibships or in sibships without clinical or serological evidence of autoimmune thyroid disease when compared to sibships with such evidence. In association studies there were no associations at the D14S1 locus. Within the Ig CH region there were no overall associations. However, within the RA population G1m (z) and G3m (g) both appeared less frequent in DR4-negative RA versus both DR4-positive RA and versus control groups. Analysis of DNA variants at Ig CH loci showed differences at the gamma 4 locus with a 9.0 kb fragment appearing less frequently in DR4-positive RA versus DR4-negative RA and control groups. The results suggest a weak or HLA-DR dependent effect of genes linked to the Ig CH region on susceptibility to RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in paraffin-embedded liver tissues in chronic hepatitis B or non-A, non-B, hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. We developed a polymerase chain reaction assay for the direct detection of hepatitis B virus in paraffin-embedded liver tissue and applied this assay to determine whether hepatitis B virus DNA exists in livers with chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B. Fifty five liver biopsy samples were studied: 11 from patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis (paraffin-embedded) and 44 from patients with chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B (21 paraffin-embedded; 25 fresh frozen). Thirty three (75%) of the non-A, non-B cases were positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies. Approximately 1 to 10 ng of DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue and amplified using oligonucleotide (23-mer) primers specific for the S gene (positions 261 to 692). The beta-globin gene was used as an internal control for sensitivity because this is a single copy gene and allows for relative quantification. In each of the chronic hepatitis B livers, the expected 432-base-pair amplification product for hepatitis B virus DNA and beta-globin gene product were both detected. On the other hand, in the 21 paraffin-embedded chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B livers, no hepatitis B virus DNA was detected, although beta-globin gene was observed in all. Furthermore, in all 25 frozen non-A, non-B livers, beta-globin gene was observed, but no hepatitis B virus band was seen. The limit of detection of hepatitis B virus DNA by this method was estimated to be one genomic copy of hepatitis B virus DNA per cell.",Virus_Diseases
Marfan syndrome is closely linked to a marker on chromosome 15q1.5----q2.1. Marfan syndrome is a systemic disorder of the connective tissue inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The disorder imparts significant morbidity and mortality. The etiology of the disorder remains elusive. A recent study localized the gene for Marfan syndrome on chromosome 15. We present data showing that marker D15S48 is genetically linked to Marfan syndrome. Pairwise linkage analysis gave a maximum lod (logarithm of odds) score of Z = 11.78 at theta = 0.02. Furthermore our data suggest that the Marfan syndrome locus is possibly flanked on either side by D15S48 and D15S49.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Simultaneous in situ genotyping and phenotyping of human papillomavirus cervical lesions: comparative sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of immunocytochemistry were compared with those of non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) for the direct detection of human papillomaviruses in biopsy specimens. Four monoclonal antibodies raised to the capsid protein of HPV16 were less specific than NISH: all four reacted with lesions containing HPV33, and HPV18. Absolute discrimination of HPV types, therefore, was not possible with the monoclonal antibodies used in this study. The relative sensitivities of these antibodies were also lower than NISH. Sequential immunocytochemistry and NISH on the same section showed that 2.9-13.0 times as many cells were positive by NISH than by immunocytochemistry using the most sensitive monoclonal antibody. These data indicate that NISH has higher diagnostic specificity and sensitivity than immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to the HPV16 capsid protein.",Virus_Diseases
"Serum levels of IL-2, IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and soluble receptor of IL-2 in HIV-1-infected patients. Serum levels of the interleukins (IL-1 alpha, IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and soluble receptor of IL-2 (sIL-2R) were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 12 normal healthy controls and 52 HIV-1 seropositive patients. Results indicated that: (1) sIL-2R levels were significantly increased in most HIV-1 seropositive patients. This increase appeared to be correlated with low CD4 cell counts and with the presence of detectable levels of p25 antigen. Furthermore, initially high levels of sIL-2R appeared to be correlated with progression of disease. (2) IL-2 levels were found to be increased in about 43% of asymptomatic carriers (ASY) and subjects with lymphoadenopathy-associated syndrome (LAS) compared with 12% in the case of AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS patients. (3) There was a positive correlation between serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha in nearly all patients. Detectable levels of both cytokines were found in 34% of ASY and LAS patients and only rarely were detectable in ARC and AIDS patients. (4) Sixteen patients in whom progression of disease was observed were studied initially and at the moment they upstaged. No significant modification of serum levels of the three cytokines and sIL-2R studied could be evidenced. It was concluded that sIL-2R could be a useful marker of disease activity and progression, though a prospective study is necessary. For IL-2, IL-1 alpha, and TNF-alpha, this study indicated the presence of variable alterations in serum levels in HIV-1-infected patients.",Virus_Diseases
"Characterization of herpes simplex virus type 2 latency-associated transcription in human sacral ganglia and in cell culture. The ability of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) to establish latency in and reactivate from sacral dorsal root sensory ganglia is the basis for recurrent genital herpes. The expression of HSV-2 genes in latently infected human sacral ganglia was investigated by in situ hybridization. Hybridizations with a probe from the long repeat region of HSV-2 revealed strong nuclear signals overlying neurons in sacral ganglia from five of nine individuals. The RNA detected overlaps with the transcript for infected cell protein O but in the opposite, or ""anti-sense,"" orientation. These observations mimic those made previously with HSV-1 in human trigeminal ganglia and confirm the recent findings during latency in HSV-2-infected mice and guinea pigs. Northern hybridization of RNA from infected Vero cells showed that an HSV-2 latency-associated transcript was similar in size to the larger (1.85 kb) latency transcript of HSV-1. Thus, HSV-1 and HSV-2 latency in human sensory ganglia are similar, if not identical, in terms of their cellular localization and pattern of transcription.",Virus_Diseases
"Cellular, immunologic and biochemical characterization of topical retinoic acid-treated human skin [published erratum appears in J Invest Dermatol 1991 Jun;96(6):814] Histologic and clinical improvement of sun-exposed skin following topical treatment with retinoic acid has been reported. Daily application of retinoic acid typically results within 2-5 d in an erythematous scaling reaction, which lessens with continued usage. The cellular, immunologic, and biochemical basis of this retinoid reaction and its role in the repair of photodamaged skin are not known. To investigate the retinoid reaction in man, we have treated non-sun-exposed skin with 0.1% retinoic acid cream (Retin-A, Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, Raritan, NJ) under occlusion for 4 d to induce erythema and then examined changes in 1) histology, 2) expression of cell-surface molecules, 3) the enzymes and second messengers of the phospholipase C/protein kinase C signal-transduction system, 4) levels of eicosanoids, and 5) levels of interleukin-1 protein and mRNA. These parameters were chosen for measurement both because they are indicators of epidermal function and previous studies suggest they may be responsive to retinoic acid treatment. Epidermal cell growth as judged by increased epidermal thickness and mitotic figures was significantly increased in retinoic acid-treated skin compared to vehicle-treated controls. Increased numbers of CD4+ T cells accompanied by prominence of dermal dendrocytes in the papillary dermis and focal keratinocyte expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were observed in retinoic acid-treated biopsies. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity and 1,2-diacylglycerol content were also elevated in retinoic acid-treated epidermis. Protein kinase C activity was reduced by one third in both the soluble and membrane fraction, suggesting down-regulation. Surprisingly, in view of the inflammatory nature of the retinoid reaction, no increases were observed in arachidonic acid, its metabolites, interleukin-1 alpha, or interleukin-1 beta. To examine the specificity of the retinoid reaction, subjects were treated with the irritant sodium lauryl sulfate, under conditions that resulted in a reaction clinically similar to that observed with retinoic acid. The histologic alterations induced by sodium lauryl sulfate were found to be indistinguishable from those induced by retinoic acid. These data indicate that, although a wide range of cellular and molecular alterations occur in retinoic acid-treated skin, these changes may not be necessarily specific or unique for retinoic acid.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Disease progression and viral genome variants in experimental feline leukemia virus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome [published erratum appears in J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 1991;4(9):925] A fatal immunodeficiency syndrome with clinical and pathologic features similar to human AIDS is inducible in cats by experimental inoculation with a specific strain of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) called FeLV-FAIDS. The course of the feline disease is characterized by an age-dependent prodromal period during which a non-disease-specific, common form of proviral DNA is detected in bone marrow. Preceding clinical onset of immunodeficiency is production of high levels of specific, pathogenic variant genomes, primarily as unintegrated viral DNA, in bone marrow. Acute immunodeficiency syndrome (survival period approximately 3 months) is associated with a short prodromal period and appearance of a characteristic variant genome (variant A) that persists at high copy number as integrated and full-length unintegrated viral DNA in bone marrow. Chronic immunodeficiency syndrome (survival greater than 1 year) is marked by a longer prodromal period, a more gradual onset of severe clinical immunosuppression, and a predominance of other variant genomes that often contain substantial internal deletions. In both forms of the disease, tissue-specific replication of certain variant viruses is noted in the bone marrow, intestine, and lymph nodes. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo virus transmission studies indicates that the appearance of FeLV-FAIDS variant viruses reflects differential replication of viral genomes pre-existing in the inoculum rather than rapid de novo evolution of new variants within each animal. These results demonstrate that retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency disease in cats can be associated with and prefigured by the amplified replication of specific viral variants in target tissues.",Virus_Diseases
"Interstitial lung disease associated with connective tissue diseases. The use of statistical structure analysis in model development. Interstitial lung disorders associated with the connective tissue diseases are thought to be quite common, but their precise analysis is fraught with difficulty because of the absence of a Gold Standard that, short of open lung biopsy, is not available. Analysis is hampered by the biologic variability in test results, large overlap between the normal and the disease population for individual tests, the confounding effect of smoking, and the complexities of viewing multidimensional data. In order to better define the pattern of the lung involvement, an entirely different approach has been adopted that is based on the use of graphic and clustering techniques to define the multivariate structure inherent in the data, then discriminant analysis to assign patients into distinct clusters. Using this approach it has been possible to group patients into four distinct clusters based on the result of respiratory function studies, gallium lung scan, bronchoalveolar lavage, and smoking status. These clusters are a normal smoking cluster and a normal nonsmoking cluster, a cluster of patients with active ILD, and a cluster with bronchiolitis. The validity of this method has been verified, and an algorithm has been developed that allows the assignment of any new patient entering the study into one of these clusters. This type of analysis offers a valuable new approach to the categorization of patients into distinct groups based on the results of multiple investigations.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Neopterin and interferon-gamma in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HIV-associated neurologic disease. We measured the levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and neopterin in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of 121 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive (HIV+) and 62-seronegative (HIV-) individuals evaluated for neurologic disease. CSF levels of IFN-gamma and serum and CSF levels of neopterin were higher in HIV+ than in HIV- individuals. Patients with HIV- related meningitis and with opportunistic CNS infections had higher serum neopterin levels than HIV+ asymptomatic individuals. CSF levels of IFN-gamma were slightly higher in CSF of HIV+ individuals in all groups (0.31 +/- 0.03 U/ml) than in HIV- individuals (0.12 +/- 0.03). CSF levels of neopterin were similar in HIV+ asymptomatic individuals (6.9 +/- 0.7 nmol/l) and HIV- individuals (5.9 +/- 1.1), but were elevated in those HIV-infected individuals with neurologic disease, particularly patients with HIV-associated meningitis (72.1 +/- 13.3 nmol/l), opportunistic CNS infections (36 +/- 9.1), and inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (32.4 +/- 17.2). Levels of neopterin correlated positively with levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor and soluble CD8, 2 additional indicators of immune activation. In the absence of neurologic disease, levels of IFN-gamma and neopterin in both serum and CSF were stable for up to 4 years after seroconversion. These data suggest that increased CSF neopterin is associated with HIV-associated neurologic disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Quantitative detection of brain aberrations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individuals by magnetic resonance imaging. The brains of 65 individuals with antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 20 HIV-1 seronegative homosexual men, and 75 heterosexual controls were examined by a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging technique. A white matter aberration was detected most frequently in patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) or AIDS, but also in asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive persons and in HIV-1 seronegative homosexual men, of whom two of three tested were reactive for HIV-1 DNA by polymerase chain reaction. The aberration was not found in the control group. Brain atrophy was mainly confined to patients with ARC or AIDS. The brain lesions correlated with the presence of HIV-1 in cerebrospinal fluid and with elevated levels of beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin. The most pronounced brain aberrations were in patients with AIDS-dementia complex. These findings indicate that brain aberrations may occur in persons in the early stages of HIV-1 infection, although to no greater extent than in HIV-1 seronegative homosexual men. The occurrence of pronounced brain lesions seems to be associated with the presence of an advanced immunodeficiency.",Virus_Diseases

During a 15-month period, September 1984 through January 1986, 10 women who were treated in the Section of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, developed vaginal or vulvar adenosis after CO2 laser vaporization. The indications for therapy were condylomata of the cervix, vagina and vulva refractory to conservative management in 3 patients, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia in 3, lichen sclerosus in 1 and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with condylomata on the cervix and vagina in 3. All the patients underwent treatment of the vagina. Most underwent treatment of the cervix, and some underwent treatment of the vulva at various degrees of intensity and depth. During the posttreatment colposcopic follow-up examination, all the patients demonstrated lesions colposcopically consistent with adenosis of the vagina or vulva within the area treated with the CO2 laser.

"Outcomes of pregnancies among women and partners of men with a history of exposure to methoxsalen photochemotherapy (PUVA) for the treatment of psoriasis. Because oral methoxsalen and UV-A radiation (PUVA) therapy is mutagenic, concern exists about the potential for teratogenic effects resulting from the use of this therapy at the time of conception and during pregnancy. After 12.8 years of prospective study, we documented the pregnancy outcomes among 1380 patients (892 men and 488 women) who received PUVA treatments. Ninety-four men reported 167 pregnancies in their partners, and 93 women reported 159 pregnancies. For 34% of pregnancies among partners of male patients, the man received PUVA therapy near the time of conception. Nineteen percent of female patients reported exposure to PUVA at the time of conception or during pregnancy. Induced and spontaneous abortions were reported as the outcome of pregnancy more often by female than by male patients (12% vs 30%). Two congenital malformations and two stillbirths occurred, an incidence not significantly different from that expected for the general population. Although the power of our study to detect an increase in the risk of specific defects is limited, our data show no evidence to suggest that PUVA is a potent teratogen. Still, because PUVA is mutagenic, we believe it prudent for patients to avoid PUVA treatment during pregnancy whenever practical.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Serodiagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with an HCV core protein molecularly expressed by a recombinant baculovirus. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for serological diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, using HCV core protein (p22) synthesized by a recombinant baculovirus. Among 58 clinically well-defined chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) patients, 49 (84.5%) were positive for p22 antibody (anti-p22), whereas 42 (72.4%) were positive for C100-3 antibody (anti-C100-3), as measured by the present assay using the HCV nonstructural protein as antigen. Thirty-nine patients (67.2%) had both antibodies. No significant level of anti-p22 was detected in sera of chronic hepatitis B patients or normal blood donors. In typical post-transfusion NANBH patients, anti-p22 could be detected at, or even before, the first alanine aminotransferase peak. Anti-p22 was also detected in blood donors who were previously shown to be involved in transmitting HCV but in whose serum anti-C100-3 was not detectable. The ELISA detecting antibody to the HCV core protein expressed and properly processed in animal cells will be useful for mass screening of donor blood as well as for early diagnosis of hepatitis C.",Virus_Diseases
"Cerebrospinal fluid neopterin in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy.",Virus_Diseases

"Poliomyelitis-like paralysis during recovery from acute bronchial asthma: possible etiology and risk factors. A poliomyelitis-like paralytic disease during recovery from an attack of bronchial asthma is described in two young children. They presented at the age of 13 and 22 months, respectively, with acute flaccid paralysis of one or both lower limbs and preserved sensation. Cerebrospinal fluid examinations revealed mild protein elevation in both and pleocytosis in the second infant. Enteroviruses were isolated in a nasal swab and stools of the second patient. Acute onset of flaccid paralysis with absent motor action potential and normal sensory responses, detected by electrophysiologic studies, are highly suggestive of motor anterior horn cell disease in these infants. A multifactorial setup of immune suppression, stress, and neurotoxic drugs during an acute bronchial asthma attack triggered by a viral disease may render the patient vulnerable to viral invasion of the anterior horn cell with enteroviruses other than poliovirus.

"Sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus and its relation with hepatitis B virus and HIV  OBJECTIVE--To determine the extent of transmission of hepatitis C virus in sexual partners of intravenous drug misusers and to examine the relation between the prevalences of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections in homosexual men and intravenous drug misusers and their sexual partners. DESIGN--Serum samples collected between 1984 and 1988 were tested for hepatitis B virus markers and antibodies against hepatitis C virus by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for HIV antibody by enzyme immune analysis and western blotting. SETTING--Large referral university hospital with an external AIDS clinic in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain. SUBJECTS--243 Intravenous drug misusers, 143 of their regular heterosexual partners, and 105 homosexual men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalences of hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV infections. RESULTS--In all, 178 of the 243 (73%) intravenous drug misusers, 16 out of 143 (11%) of their partners, and 17 of the 105 (16%) homosexual men had antibodies against hepatitis C virus. The presence of hepatitis C virus infection was unrelated to sex, age, the presence of HIV or hepatitis B virus infections, or the Centers for Disease Control stage of HIV. In sexual partners of intravenous drug misusers there were strong correlations between the presence of hepatitis C virus infection and that of HIV (p = 0.001) and hepatitis B virus (p = 0.013) infections. CONCLUSIONS--Intravenous drug misusers have a high risk of acquiring hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV infections, but the presence of hepatitis C virus infection seems to be unrelated to the presence of the other two viruses. Homosexual men have a high prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B virus infections with a low prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection, the presence of which is not related to that of the other two infections. Conversely, heterosexual partners of intravenous drug misusers have low prevalences of the three virus infections, but the presence of hepatitis C virus infection correlates significantly with the presence of HIV and hepatitis B infections. The rate of sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus seems to be low, even in partners of people known to be seropositive for this virus.",Virus_Diseases
"Low-dose zidovudine in children with an human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection acquired in the perinatal period  This report describes the one-year results of a noncomparative study designed to assess the safety and tolerance of low-dose zidovudine (azidothymidine) given orally to 60 human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected infants and children. At baseline, the mean age was 1.9 years (+/- 1.4), and all were symptomatic: 43% were P2A and 57% were P2B to F according to the Centers for Disease Control classification. All the patients received zidovudine for at least 6 months, and 52 of them (87%) completed a full year of therapy. The mean duration of follow-up was 346 days (+/- 42) (range, 183 to 366 days). The initial therapy consisted of four daily doses of 100 mg/m2 (400 mg/m2 per day, equivalent to 20 mg/kg per day). However, this treatment was modified when neutropenia or anemia was observed. Twenty-nine children (48%) remained at the initial therapy for the entire study. Zidovudine dosage was adjusted 92 times in the other 31 children (52%), mostly due to neutropenia (83%). Altogether, the time under full-dose therapy represented 81% of the total duration of the protocol for all patients. Children with mild symptoms, P2A at study entry, were more likely to remain under full-dose therapy than children with severe symptoms, P2B to F: the time under full-dose therapy represented 91% of the duration of the protocol for the former group and only 74% for the latter one (P less than .02).

"Evidence that cutaneous antigen-presenting cells migrate to regional lymph nodes during contact sensitization. These studies address the hypothesis that Ag-bearing epidermal Langerhans cells migrate to the regional lymph node during contact sensitization and function as APC. Skin from C3H mice was grafted onto BALB/c nude mice, and 7 or 14 days later, the recipients were sensitized with FITC through the grafts. APC from lymph nodes draining the site of sensitization were capable of sensitizing C3H recipients to FITC. Because sensitization is MHC restricted, only cells reaching the lymph node from the grafted skin could have induced contact hypersensitivity in C3H mice. Examination of the FITC+ draining lymph node cells by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that all were Ia+, most were F4/80+, and some contained Birbeck granules. These studies demonstrate that Ia+, FITC+ cells from the skin, at least some of which are Langerhans cells, leave the skin after epicutaneous sensitization with FITC and participate in the initiation of the contact hypersensitivity response within the regional lymph node.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Recurrent varicella-zoster virus infections in apparently immunocompetent children. Fourteen generally healthy children (5 females, 9 males, ages 18 months to 13 years) who have developed 2 to 5 attacks of chickenpox are described. Herpes zoster also occurred in 2 of 14 children. No case of chickenpox was severe or associated with complications. General studies of immunoglobulins, specific antibodies to immunization agents, complement and lymphocyte subpopulation number and function indicated that 1 of 14 had low serum IgA and 3 of 14 lacked antibody to 1 (n = 2) or 2 (n = 1) immunization agents. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific immune studies showed that the children developed VZV-antibody titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of 1:640 to 1:10 240. By immunoblot assay all appeared to develop a normal spectrum of antibodies to individual VZV proteins. All but one developed VZV cellular immune responses with stimulation indices ranging from 3.6 to 174.

"Immunologic mechanisms in psoriasis. The demonstration of activated T lymphocytes, HLA-DR+, I-CAM1+, gamma IP-10+ keratinocytes, and increased levels of lymphokines in active plaques suggests that immunologic mechanisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation in psoriasis may be linked by those cytokines many of which are produced by both keratinocytes and leukocytes. Epidermal acanthosis and keratinocyte mitoses have been observed in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and after the intradermal injection of gamma interferon. Gamma interferon and its induced proteins have been demonstrated in active psoriatic plaques. Increased levels of the keratinocyte autocrine cytokines, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, have been detected in active plaques. The apparent overexpression of IL-6 in hyperplastic psoriatic tissue may explain features of psoriasis that link keratinocyte proliferation with immune activation and tissue inflammation. Both IL-6 and gamma interferon increased TGF-alpha expression in normal cultured keratinocytes. Cytokines produced during immune activation and other inflammatory processes may lead to epidermal hyperplasia.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Zidovudine use in AIDS-free HIV-1-seropositive homosexual men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), 1987-1989. Zidovudine use data were examined in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study to determine (i) if the proportion of pre-AIDS participants (i.e., CD4+ cells less than 200/mm3 or AIDS-related complex) taking zidovudine is high enough to explain a slower than expected rise in AIDS incidence in U.S. homosexual men since mid-1987; (ii) which factors are associated with starting zidovudine and clinical trials of zidovudine; and (iii) if pre-AIDS patients, as a group, are being undertreated. Data on zidovudine use, clinical trial participation, and sociodemographic, clinical, and hematologic variables were collected every 6 months from 1,195 AIDS-free HIV-1-seropositive homosexual men from April 1987 to September 1989.

Of those with less than 200 CD4+ lymphocytes/mm3, the prevalence of zidovudine use rose from 23% (24% if those taking zidovudine or placebo as part of a clinical trial are included) at visit 7 to 58% (69%) at visit 11. Of those with ARC, 20% (23%) were using zidovudine at visit 7 and 55% (65%) at visit 11. Although numbers were small, the advanced ARC participants (CD4+ cells less than 200/mm3 and two or more symptoms) reported the highest treatment rates (50, 78, 80, 60, and 74% at visits 7-11, respectively). By September 1989, 42% (31%) of those with CD4+ lymphocyte levels less than 200/mm3 were still not receiving zidovudine, suggesting that many high-risk, pre-AIDS individuals are being undertreated. To explore this finding further, we examined a range of sociodemographic, hematologic, and clinical variables to determine which factors best predicted initiation of zidovudine therapy outside of clinical trials. In multivariate analyses, CD4+ lymphocyte number was the most consistent predictor of initiation of therapy over all four study visits. For each 100 cells/mm3 deficit, the odds ratios were 2.3 (95% C.I. of 1.7-3.1) at visit 7 and 1.7% (95% C.I. of 1.4-2.0) at visit 11. Symptom status and education level were also associated with starting zidovudine, but not at all visits. The relatively low predictive power of the clinical variables raises and the possibility that nonclinical factors not measured in the MACS (drug cost, third-party insurance restrictions, and individual preferences) may play an important role in predicting zidovudine use. Finally, comparisons were made between seropositive participants starting clinical trials of zidovudine and the rest of the study population. No important differences were found in demographic or major clinical variables between clinical trial participants and zidovudine nonusers in this study.",Virus_Diseases
"Apolipoprotein A-I and its amphipathic helix peptide analogues inhibit human immunodeficiency virus-induced syncytium formation. The envelope (membrane) glycoprotein of HIV is essential for virus attachment and entry into host cells. Additionally, when expressed on the plasma membrane of infected cells, the envelope protein is responsible for mediating cell-cell fusion which leads to the formation of multinucleated giant cells, one of the major cytopathic effects of HIV infections. The envelope glycoproteins of HIV contain regions that can fold into amphipathic alpha-helixes, and these regions have been suggested to play a role in subunit associations and in virus-induced cell fusion and cytopathic effects of HIV. We therefore tested the possibility that amphipathic helix-containing peptides and proteins may interfere with the HIV amphipathic peptides and inhibit those steps of HIV infection involving membrane fusion. Apolipoprotein A-I, the major protein component of high density lipoprotein, and its amphipathic peptide analogue were found to inhibit cell fusion, both in HIV-1-infected T cells and in recombinant vaccinia-virus-infected CD4+ HeLa cells expressing HIV envelope protein on their surfaces. The amphipathic peptides inhibited the infectivity of HIV-1. The inhibitory effects were manifest when the virus, but not cells, was pretreated with the peptides. Also, a reduction in HIV-induced cell killing was observed when virus-infected cell cultures were maintained in presence of amphipathic peptides. These results have potential implications for HIV biology and therapy.",Virus_Diseases
"Comparison of HIV detection by virus isolation in lymphocyte cultures and molecular amplification of HIV DNA and RNA by PCR in offspring of seropositive mothers. An early and accurate diagnosis of HIV infection is needed in the offspring of seropositive mothers. To this end, we have used two techniques for the direct detection of HIV in 12 newborns tested within 2 weeks after birth and 12 children. HIV isolation was carried out in lymphocyte cocultures and compared with detection of DNA and RNA sequences by molecular amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In lymphocyte cocultures, HIV was isolated in 8 of 24 cases (33%), including 3 newborns, 3 symptomatic children, and 2 asymptomatic ones. HIV DNA was detected by PCR in twice as many cases, i.e., in 16/24 cases (66%), including 7/12 newborns, 4/4 symptomatic children, and 5/8 asymptomatic ones, 2 of whom became seronegative, HIV RNA was detected in 10 of 16 cases (60%) with detectable HIV DNA, including all of the cases who had a positive HIV isolation. Only children with clinical or biological signs of HIV infection were positive for HIV RNA. Furthermore, signs of HIV infection appeared within 6 months in three of the four newborns who were positive for HIV RNA at birth. These results indicate that HIV DNA detection by PCR is far more sensitive than HIV isolation in culture for the early diagnosis of HIV infection in offspring of seropositive mothers. HIV RNA detection appears to be a useful prognostic marker since it does correlate with disease progression and may serve as a clue for HIV replication in vivo.",Virus_Diseases
"Aseptic meningitis as a complication of mumps vaccination. In 1989 a nationwide surveillance of neurologic complications after the administration of mumps vaccine was conducted in Japan, based on the notification of cases and the testing of mumps viruses isolated from cerebrospinal fluid for their relatedness to the vaccine by nucleotide sequence analysis. Among 630,157 recipients of measles-mumps-rubella trivalent (MMR) vaccine containing the Urabe Am9 mumps vaccine, there were at least 311 meningitis cases suspected to be vaccine-related. In 96 of these 311 cases, mumps virus related to the vaccine was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. The unusually high incidence may have been partly a result of the adverse media publicity of the problem at the time of surveillance. We analyzed clinical features of 165 and 27 laboratory-confirmed mumps vaccine-related meningitis cases that occurred among the recipients of MMR and monovalent mumps vaccines, respectively, during a 1-year period after the introduction of MMR vaccine. The incidence of vaccine-related meningitis was similar among the recipients of MMR and monovalent Urabe Am9 mumps vaccines. Meningitis was generally mild and there were no sequelae from the illness. The complication was more frequent among male than among female children.",Virus_Diseases
"Failure to detect human T-cell leukemia virus-related sequences in multiple sclerosis blood. We tested 11 patients with multiple sclerosis for the presence of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)- or type II (HTLV-II)-related sequences. DNA from blood mononuclear cells was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction utilizing three different oligonucleotide primer pairs. Two of these primer pairs detect sequences shared between HTLV-I and HTLV-II in either p24, gag protein, or in p21, env transmembrane protein. The third primer pair was synthesized based on regions in the pol gene where amino acid sequences are conserved between HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and the related bovine leukemia virus. The multiple sclerosis samples were consistently negative while appropriate control samples were positive. We conclude that viruses related to HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or bovine leukemia virus are not present in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis and, therefore, that HTLV-bovine leukemia virus-related viruses are not likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.",Virus_Diseases
"Amyopathic dermatomyositis (dermatomyositis sine myositis). Presentation of six new cases and review of the literature. We report six patients with the classic cutaneous findings of dermatomyositis who did not develop clinical or laboratory evidence of muscle disease for at least 2 years after onset of their skin manifestations. Such patients represent 11% of our total experience with dermatomyositis patients during a 15 year period. All six patients had Gottron's paules, periungual erythema/telangiectasia, and violaceous discoloration of the face, neck, upper chest, and back at some time during the course of their disease. In addition, all complained of pruritus and photosensitivity. None of the patients had evidence of malignancy. Each of five patients treated with oral corticosteroids for their cutaneous disease had marked improvement and did not develop myositis. These cases further emphasize that the cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis are pathognomonic of this disease and challenge the commonly held notion that muscle disease always develops within 2 years of onset of skin disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The role of HTLV in HIV-1 neurologic disease. We performed a serologic survey for antibodies to HTLV-I/II in the course of a longitudinal study of the neurologic complications of HIV-1 infection. Nine (3.7%) of 242 HIV-1 seropositive subjects and none of 60 HIV-1 seronegative control subjects had antibodies to HTLV-I/II by ELISA. Western blot and polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of HTLV-I in 2 subjects and HTLV-II infection in 2 others. Both HIV-1/HTLV-I coinfected subjects and 1 HIV-1/HTLV-II coinfected subject had a slowly progressive myelopathy clinically identical tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). The presence of a myelopathy resembling TSP/HAM in the coinfected subjects suggests that HIV-1 may enhance the expression of neurologic disease caused by HTLV. Patients with a progressive myelopathy occurring in association with HIV-1 infection should be serologically tested for the presence of HTLV. Establishing dual infection has therapeutic and prognostic import as 1 of the HIV-1/HTLV-I subjects substantially improved with corticosteroids and the HIV-1/HTLV-II subject with myelopathy had a marked improvement in the absence of therapeutic intervention.,Virus_Diseases
"Stimulation of healing of chronic wounds by epidermal growth factor. We evaluated the effect of topical epidermal growth factor treatment on healing of chronic wounds in a prospective, open-label, crossover trial. Five males and four females who ranged in age from 40 to 72 years (average 57 +/- 9 years) were enrolled. Four patients had adult-onset diabetes mellitus, two had rheumatoid arthritis, two had old burn scars, and one had a failed abdominal incision. The average duration of the ulcers prior to treatment with epidermal growth factor was 12 +/- 5 months (range 1 to 48 months). Following failure of the wounds to heal with conventional therapies, including debridement, skin graphs, and vascular reconstruction, wounds were treated twice daily with Silvadene alone for periods ranging from 3 weeks to 6 months. No evidence of healing was observed in any of the patients' wounds during Silvadene treatment, and patients were crossed over to twice a day treatment with Silvadene containing 10 micrograms epidermal growth factor per gram. Wounds of eight patients healed completely with epidermal growth factor-Silvadene treatment in an average of 34 +/- 26 days (mean +/- SD, range 12 to 92 days) and did not reoccur for periods ranging from 1 to 4 years. One patient failed therapy. These results suggest that topical treatment of chronic wounds with epidermal growth factor may stimulate healing.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Biopsies showed foamy, basophilic, distended cytoplasm in granular layer keratinocytes, characteristic of the human papillomavirus types seen in epidermodysplasia verruciformis.

"Selective expansion of T cells bearing the gamma/delta receptor and expressing an unusual repertoire in the synovial membrane of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In a study of 7 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we characterized the T cell population present in the synovial membrane, thought to be the location where T cells trigger the disease. Synovial membrane lymphocytes from the RA patients were found to have a selective expansion of gamma/delta T cells (8.8% in synovial membrane versus 4% in peripheral blood). Expansion of the gamma/delta T cell subset was not found in the synovial membrane of patients with osteoarthritis. We characterized the gamma/delta T cell repertoire using monoclonal antibodies Ti gamma A, BB3, and delta TCS1, which recognize the gene products encoded by V gamma 9, V delta 2, and V delta 1-J delta 1, respectively. The majority of the synovial gamma/delta T cells did not express the repertoire encoded by these genes, which is found in nearly 100% of the peripheral blood gamma/delta T cells of healthy volunteer donors and in the thymus at early stages of development. We conclude that the synovial membrane of patients with RA displays a selective expansion of a specific population of gamma/delta T cells expressing a clonotypic receptor not yet serologically defined, which might be implicated in the development of the disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Immunosuppressive effects of clonidine on the induction of contact sensitization in the balb/c mouse. The clonidine transdermal therapeutic system (clonidine-TTS) has been associated with a significant incidence of allergic contact sensitization. This incidence was not predicted by premarket skin sensitization testing in animals or humans. One possible explanation lies in recent findings in guinea pigs that clonidine exposure could inhibit the elicitation of skin reactions to unrelated strong contact sensitizers. However, these studies also showed that clonidine pretreatment did not appear to affect the induction of contact sensitization. On this basis, we sought to specifically evaluate the induction phase of sensitization to clonidine as an alternative means of assessing its sensitization properties. The method selected was the assay of in situ lymphocyte proliferation in lymph nodes draining the sites of clonidine exposure, a method recently promoted as an alternative means to assess contact allergenic potential. Utilizing various induction application techniques and regimens, we were consistently unable to demonstrate clonidine's allergenic potential through such an assessment of lymphocyte proliferation. We were also unable to demonstrate sensitization by in vivo ear swelling or in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis assay techniques. However, a subsequent assessment of the effect of clonidine exposure on the induction of sensitization to unrelated strong contact allergens demonstrated a consistent 40-70% inhibition of the proliferative response to the contact allergens oxazolone and trinitrochlorobenzene. This was similar to the degree of suppression produced by the corticosteroids fluocinonide and hydrocortisone when they were tested at 80 and 10 times lower concentrations. In addition, we observed a comparable inhibition of the ear swelling response to oxazolone. These data extend our knowledge of the immunomodulatory effects of clonidine and offer additional mechanistic insights into the failure of short-term predictive patch-test methods to detect this chemical's potential to induce allergic contact sensitization.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Seroepidemiology of hepatitis C virus infection in Taiwan. The prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus among Chinese subjects in Taiwan was evaluated using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. The overall prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus was 0.28% among 1,419 healthy subjects, 0.8% among 500 unselected paid blood donors and 0.4% among 793 pregnant women. The three offspring of the mothers positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus were all found to be positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus at birth but all became negative by the age of 6 mo. Among healthy subjects, none of 1,000 school children and young adolescents had antibody to hepatitis C virus. Among patients in selected ""high-risk"" groups, antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 100% of 9 hemophiliac patients who were positive for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus, in 53% of 115 intravenous drug abusers, in 34.4% of 96 hemodialysis patient and in 15.8% of 19 homosexual men who were positive for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus. Only 7.1% of 196 prostitutes, 5.9% of 34 spouses of patients positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus and 0.5% of 201 brothelgoers had antibody to hepatitis C virus. These findings suggest that hepatitis C virus is transmitted mainly by the parenteral route in Taiwan.

"Cervical papillomavirus infection and cervical dysplasia in Hispanic, Native American, and non-Hispanic white women in New Mexico. BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus infections of the cervix are found with varying frequencies in different populations worldwide, and have been associated with cervical cytologic abnormalities. METHODS: We studied 1,603 randomly selected Hispanic, Native American, and non-Hispanic White women in New Mexico to determine the prevalence of cervical HPV infection in these ethnic groups, and its association with Pap smear abnormalities, using a new commercial dot-blot hybridization assay. RESULTS: Nine percent of all women screened had evidence of cervical HPV infection (13.7% of non-Hispanic White women, 9.7% of Hispanics, and 6.6% of Native American women). Prevalence was higher in younger women ages 14-19 years than in older age groups. Over half of women with cervical HPV infection (n = 145) had normal Pap smears. The proportion of infected women increased among those with more advanced cytopathologic abnormalities; 5.6 percent with normal Pap smears had cervical HPV vs 66.7 percent with moderate-severe dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical HPV infection is common among New Mexico clinic attendees, varies in prevalence among the three major ethnic groups, and is strongly associated with cervical cytopathologic abnormalities.",Virus_Diseases
"Epidural morphine with butorphanol for postoperative analgesia after cesarean delivery. Epidural morphine has been used more and more to provide long-lasting postoperative analgesia after cesarean delivery. However, the incidence of pruritus (20%-93%) and nausea (17%-60%) detract from the usefulness of epidural morphine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in 30 patients having epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery, the analgesic efficacy and side effects when a combination of epidural morphine, a mu-receptor agonist, and butorphanol, a mu-receptor antagonist and kappa-receptor agonist, was administered. After clamping of the umbilical cord, patients received 4 mg epidural morphine with 3 mL of normal saline (group 1), 4 mg epidural morphine with 1 mg butorphanol and 2 mL of normal saline (group 2), or 4 mg epidural morphine with 3 mg butorphanol (group 3). Patients were monitored for 24 h after administration of the study medications. There were no significant differences between the groups in visual analogue pain scores, time to first analgesic request, respiratory rate, or Trieger dot test performance in the 24 h immediately after these epidural injections. There were three patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2 who experienced oxygen saturations less than 90%. (No patients in group 3 developed an oxygen saturation less than 92%.)

"Progression of human papillomavirus type 18-immortalized human keratinocytes to a malignant phenotype. We have developed a model system for progression of human epithelial cells to malignancy, using a human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18)-immortalized human keratinocyte cell line. Cells of cell line FEP-1811 were nontumorigenic in athymic mice through at least 12 passages in culture, but after 32 passages were weakly tumorigenic, producing tumors that regressed. After 62 passages they produced invasive squamous cell carcinomas that grew progressively. The progression to malignancy was associated with an increase in the efficiency of forming colonies in soft agar and with altered differentiation properties. In an organotypic culture system, FEP-1811 cells at passages 12 and 32 exhibited features typical of premalignant intraepithelial neoplasia in vivo, and cells at passage 68 exhibited features consistent with squamous cell carcinomas. No change in copy number of the transfected HPV-18 genome or in the level of expression of the viral transforming gene products E6 and E7 was detected between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells. Cytogenetic analysis of cells at early, middle, and late passage levels and cells cultured from tumors revealed that several chromosomal abnormalities segregated with the tumorigenic cell populations.",Virus_Diseases
"Modeling the impact of breast-feeding by HIV-infected women on child survival [published erratum appears in Am J Public Health 1991 May;81(5):658-9] This study models the survival outcomes of children born to HIV-infected (human immunodeficiency virus) women who are breast-fed, bottle-fed, and wet-nursed. It is estimated that, given the relative risk of alternatives to maternal milk in developing countries, the probability of HIV transmission via breast milk would need to be at least .12 in a community with an under five child mortality rate from non-HIV causes of 100/1000 live births and at least .27 in a community with a rate of 200/1000 before alternative feeding practices should be recommended even to the known HIV-infected mother who has an available feeding alternative with a relative risk of 2:1. While such a low relative risk may be achievable with wet nursing, most studies report a relative risk of at least 3:1 for bottle feeding. A sensitivity analysis is conducted around the relative risk of child mortality from non-HIV causes associated with different feeding practices. While the critical transmission rate does not vary significantly with a rate of false positives as high as 20 percent on the HIV screening test, the critical transmission rate is very sensitive to the availability of HIV screening. In communities where the HIV prevalence rate among mothers reaches 40 percent, breast-feeding should still be recommended in the absence of HIV screening unless HIV transmission via breast milk surpasses 30 percent.",Virus_Diseases

"Mapping of herpes simplex virus-1 neurovirulence to gamma 134.5, a gene nonessential for growth in culture. The gene designated gamma 134.5 maps in the inverted repeats flanking the long unique sequence of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) DNA, and therefore it is present in two copies per genome. This gene is not essential for viral growth in cell culture. Four recombinant viruses were genetically engineered to test the function of this gene. These were (i) a virus from which both copies of the gene were deleted, (ii) a virus containing a stop codon in both copies of the gene, (iii) a virus containing after the first codon an insert encoding a 16-amino acid epitope known to react with a specific monoclonal antibody, and (iv) a virus in which the deleted sequences were restored. The viruses from which the gene was deleted or which carried stop codons were avirulent on intracerebral inoculation of mice. The virus with the gene tagged by the sequence encoding the epitope was moderately virulent, whereas the restored virus reacquired the phenotype of the parent virus. Significant amounts of virus were recovered only from brains of animals inoculated with virulent viruses. Inasmuch as the product of the gamma 134.5 gene extended the host range of the virus by enabling it to replicate and destroy brain cells, it is a viral neurovirulence factor.",Virus_Diseases
Oral squamous cell carcinoma arising in a patient with long-standing lichen planus. A case report. The risk of malignant transformation of oral lichen planus remains a controversial point. Many previous reports have been discounted on the basis of inadequate information or lack of histologic confirmation of lichen planus.

"Susceptibility to effects of UVB radiation on induction of contact hypersensitivity as a risk factor for skin cancer in humans. Normal, healthy human volunteers and patients with proved history of non-melanoma skin cancer have been tested for their capacity to develop contact hypersensitivity to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) following exposure of buttock skin to acute, low-dose ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Using a radiation protocol that achieves virtually complete depletion of normal-appearing Langerhans cells from irradiated skin, it was learned that approximately 60% of healthy volunteers developed vigorous contact hypersensitivity (CH) when 2000 micrograms DNCB was painted on the irradiated site. These individuals were designated UVB-resistant, and were distinguished from other individuals, designated UVB-susceptible, who failed to develop contact hypersensitivity following an identical treatment protocol. It was then discovered that virtually all (92%) skin cancer patients exposed to UVB and DNCB failed to develop CH, i.e., were UVB-susceptible. In subsequent experiments, epicutaneous application of 2000 micrograms DNCB to unirradiated skin of UVB-susceptible individuals revealed a further distinction between normal persons and skin cancer patients. Approximately 45% of the latter (and none of the former) remained unresponsive (failed to develop contact hypersensitivity following this second attempt at sensitization), implying that they had been rendered immunologically tolerant. These tolerant individuals responded normally to the unrelated hapten, diphencyprone. We conclude that human beings resemble inbred strains of laboratory mice in that some individuals are UVB-susceptible, whereas others are UVB-resistant. Because the incidence of UVB-susceptibility was significantly higher in skin cancer patients, and as specific unresponsiveness could be demonstrated only in these patients, we propose that UVB-susceptibility, as we define it in this hapten system, may be a risk factor for the development of skin cancer.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Visceral leishmaniasis: another HIV-associated opportunistic infection? Report of eight cases and review of the literature. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is considered an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients.

We conclude that: (1) in areas where both leishmaniasis and HIV-1 infection are endemic, VL may be more frequent among HIV-infected adults; (2) in HIV-infected patients, the clinical picture did not differ significantly from classical kala azar, although it often ran a recurrent course, with resistance to antimonial therapy. We propose the inclusion of VL in the IVC-2 subgroup of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) clinical classification of HIV-1 infection while prospective and larger studies further define whether there are clinical presentations that could justify adding VL to the list of opportunistic infections indicative of AIDS.",Virus_Diseases

"Tissue plasminogen activator in psoriasis. Elevated levels of the serine proteinase plasminogen activator are observed in psoriatic lesions. In contrast to normal epidermis, lesional psoriatic epidermis contains primarily tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity and much lower levels of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) activity. Tissue plasminogen activator is also detectable immunocytochemically in lesional psoriatic but not normal epidermis. Similarly, mRNA for tPA is observed in lesional epidermis only. These results suggest that lesional psoriatic epidermis synthesizes enhanced levels of tPA compared to normal. Additional data support the hypothesis that enhanced tPA may be another marker common to psoriatic epidermis, epidermis during wound repair, and keratinocytes in culture. The significance of elevated tPA in psoriatic lesions is presently unclear, but its possible relationship to epidermal proliferation and cutaneous inflammation is under study.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"In-vitro DNA synthesis of keratinocytes in normal human skin, psoriasis, seborrhoeic keratosis, Bowen's disease and basal cell carcinoma. The DNA-synthesizing cells in benign and malignant keratotic diseases including psoriasis, seborrhoeic keratosis, Bowen's disease and basal cell carcinoma were studied. Cells in S-phase were labelled after small pieces of the lesions were incubated in tissue culture medium that contained 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). The labelling of DNA was analysed using the labelling index and pattern. Although the malignant diseases tended to show a higher DNA labelling index, neither this nor the loss of polarity alone was associated with malignancy. However, a higher DNA labelling index together with a loss of polarity was characteristic for malignancy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Isolation of HIV-1 from seropositive people living in Cotonou, Benin. Benin is located in West Africa and is situated between HIV-2 and HIV-1-endemic zones. The first cases of HIV-1 infection in Benin were reported in 1987. Since then, AIDS cases have been diagnosed there and the number of known HIV-seropositive people has rapidly increased. Blood samples were collected from 14 seropositive and 11 seronegative patients living in the main city, Cotonou, and their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured. In seven of the seropositive cases, a retrovirus was detected by measurement of Mg2(+)-dependent reverse transcriptase activity and electron microscopy. HIV-1 antigen assay and genomic analysis indicated that the isolated viruses belong to the first serotype. In each positive case, an HIV-1 DNA probe hybridized to the RNA extracted from the virus and six isolates were found positive by the polymerase chain reaction using HIV-1-specific primers.",Virus_Diseases
"The mitogenic effects of sera from psoriatic subjects on normal dermal fibroblasts: an absence of correlation with the clinical activity of psoriasis. Serum was obtained from 21 normal and 22 psoriatic subjects, and the severity of skin disease in the psoriatic patients was recorded using the PASI score. The scores ranged from 1.8 to 51.0. The growth stimulatory effect of the sera on normal dermal fibroblasts in cell culture was assessed by measuring [3H]-thymidine uptake. Each serum was assessed at four concentrations (2,5, 10,20%). The psoriatic sera were more growth stimulatory than normal sera, but this difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.02) only at 20% serum concentration. Eleven of the 22 psoriatic serum samples had a mitogenic effect greater than the mean +/- SEM of all the normal sera; these sera were then from patients with PASI scores of 4.5-51.0. Six of these psoriatic subjects were recalled after 5 months; their PASI scores were reassessed, and the mitogenic effect of new serum samples was compared with that of the initial samples. All of these patients displayed a change in serum mitogenic effect, but this was not consistent with the change in severity of skin disease over the corresponding time period. In one subject, the severity of the psoriasis had increased marginally over the 5 months, while the mitogenic effect of her serum decreased significantly (mean counts of 43808 vs. 32660; P = 0.0029).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hepatitis C virus antibodies in subjects with and without liver disease in the United Kingdom. The prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus, evidence of previous or current infection with this agent of parenterally transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis, was determined in 340 subjects residing in the United Kingdom. The antibody was detected in 3 per cent of unselected blood donors and in 60 per cent of patients with chronic post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis. Evidence for infection was also found in 30 per cent of intravenous drug abusers, and in 75 per cent of haemophiliacs receiving commercial factor VIII concentrate. The infection is uncommon in renal units and amongst sexually promiscuous groups attending sexually-transmitted disease clinics. Although the seropositivity rate in primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic B and delta hepatitis was very low (0-2 per cent), in patients with autoimmune and alcoholic liver disease it was 14-16 per cent which, although lower than that quoted in studies from Spain and Italy, is considerably higher than would be expected by chance. The reason for the high incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in this latter group of patients is unclear.",Virus_Diseases

"IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus in acute and chronic hepatitis C. To assess possible role of testing for IgM-specific antibody in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with hepatitis C, we tested sera from 14 patients with acute and 97 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis for IgG and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 93% of acute cases and 91% of chronic cases. Of the 101 patients with IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus, 57% had IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. None of the 20 healthy subjects or 40 patients with acute or chronic hepatitis A or hepatitis B had IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. At the onset of clinical symptoms in acute hepatitis C, IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 8 (57%) and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus in 9 of 14 patients (64%). Eventually, both IgG and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus became detectable in 13 of 14 patients with acute hepatitis C. Seven patients with antibody to hepatitis C virus resolved the acute infection within 6 mo and all seven cleared IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus, whereas two cleared IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus. Six patients had a chronic outcome of the acute infection and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus persisted in detectable amounts for more than 6 mo in all (mean = 15.5 mo). Among 88 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis with IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus, IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 45 (51%).",Virus_Diseases
"IgG antibodies from patients with bullous pemphigoid bind to localized epitopes on synthetic peptides encoded by bullous pemphigoid antigen cDNA. Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized in part by the presence of tissue-bound and circulating antibodies specific for basement membrane zone proteins, the BP Ag. The purpose of the present study was to determine seroreactivity of patients with BP to six nonoverlapping synthetic peptides representing sequences in the carboxyl domain of the recently cloned 230-kDa BP Ag. Sera from 40 patients with BP, 57 normal subjects, and 18 patients with other autoimmune blistering skin diseases were examined in an ELISA for binding to six synthetic peptides varying between 17 and 19 amino acids in length. The binding of IgG from patients with BP to three synthetic peptides, P1-2, P1-1, and P3-1, was significantly different from that seen in the normal controls (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test). Affinity-purified anti-P1-2 antibody from a patient with BP bound in a characteristic linear band to the epidermal side of 1 M NaCl split skin and immunoprecipitated the native 230-kDa BP Ag. Serum IgG antibodies from a rabbit immunized with a BP fusion protein that contains the sequences for P1-1 and P1-2, bound on ELISA to P1-2 but not to P1-1. These data suggest that multiple epitopes on the 230-kDa BP Ag are recognized by circulating autoantibodies in patients with this disease, and that an epitope encoded within the synthetic peptide P1-2 is expressed on the native molecule and may be relevant in the generation of an immune response both in man and in an animal model.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"HIV-related characteristics of migrant workers in rural South Carolina. After finding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a migrant worker named as a syphilis contact, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control offered HIV counseling and testing and syphilis screening to migrant workers in the surrounding two-county area. In addition, a brief questionnaire was administered to document demographics and risk behavior. Of the 265 workers aged 16 and older in 15 migrant camps, 198 (75%) consented to the survey and testing. Of the 198 tested, 85% were male and 75% single. The median age was 39, with a range of 16 to 69 years. Twenty-five (13%) were HIV antibody positive, and 32 (16%) had reactive serologic tests for syphilis. Of the 166 workers who reported the frequency of condom use, 77 (46%) indicated they never use condoms. We conclude that there is a relatively high rate of HIV infection in these rural South Carolina migrant workers, whose behavior puts them at risk for HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases.",Virus_Diseases
"Effect of interferon administration on serum hepatitis C virus RNA in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus RNA as detected by reverse transcription and nested polymerase chain reaction was monitored in 16 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. Hepatitis C virus RNA became undetectable after 4 to 8 wk of interferon administration in 13 of the 16 patients. During 6 mo of follow-up, 5 of the 13 patients who became negative for hepatitis C virus RNA after interferon administration remained negative, and all five continued to have normal ALT levels. Repeat liver biopsy in these five patients revealed histological improvement. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, which was initially positive in all treated patients, fell to undetectable levels in three of the five patients. In contrast, aminotransferase levels rose again in all eight patients who had become hepatitis C virus RNA negative but had again exhibited hepatitis C virus RNA after completion of therapy. In 16 untreated patients, hepatitis C virus RNA remained detectable. These results indicate that detection of hepatitis C virus RNA may be useful as a marker of viral replication in chronic hepatitis C; they also suggest that interferon should again be administered to patients who become hepatitis C virus RNA negative on treatment but again exhibit this marker of viral replication when treatment is stopped.",Virus_Diseases

The patient's global evaluation was the most sensitive variable overall. Pain was more sensitive than Ritchie's index. Several variables may be omitted from clinical trials, especially if two active drugs are being compared. For example, the best maximum estimate for the difference in ESR between NSAIDs and placebo was 1.0 mm/hr (95% confidence interval -1.5 to 3.4 mm/hr), and for joint size 0.44% (-1.0 to 1.9%), corresponding to a quarter of a millimeter for each of the 10 joints usually measured.

"A silver enhanced, gold labelled, immunosorbent assay for detecting antibodies to rubella virus. A silver enhanced, gold labelled, immunosorbent assay (SEGLISA) for the detection of IgG antibodies to the rubella virus in human serum was developed. Pre-coated microtitre wells are used as the immobilised base of rubella antigens on to which any rubella antibodies from patient samples will bind. This antigen/antibody complex is then visualised firstly by gold labelled anti-immunoglobulin G, which binds to any human IgG that may be present, and then by silver amplification, resulting in a black permanent deposit on the microtitre well surface. Patient samples (n = 121) were screened using a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an equivalent SEGLISA. Results were comparable but the SEGLISA does not have the disadvantages associated with enzyme labels.

"Characterization of skin-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with psoriasis. In this study, skin-infiltrating cells in psoriasis patients were characterized in biopsies from both involved and uninvolved skin. Histologic examination of biopsies showed the presence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and the lack of B lymphocytes. Skin biopsies were also placed in tissue culture medium supplemented with human serum, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and irradiated autologous blood lymphocytes. T lymphocytes grew from both plaques and univolved skin biopsies and consisted of a heterogeneous population of T-cell subsets. The immunophenotypic analysis of cultured cells was comparable to the histologic examination on frozen section, i.e., there was a greater number of CD4/CDw29+ cells than CD8+/CD45+ cells. Cultures were tested in the primed lymphocyte test (PLT) and cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assays. All cultures tested demonstrated secondary proliferative but not cytolytic reactivity. The PLT results indicate that the cell cultures generated are autoreactive.

"Expression of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors in normal and psoriatic skin. Increasing evidence suggests an immunoregulatory function of the potent steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) which has been successfully applied for treatment of psoriasis. The skin is both a site of production and a target of 1,25(OH)2D3. In vitro, 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits proliferation and stimulates differentiation of keratinocytes. We investigated the in situ expression of vitamin D-receptors (VDR) in normal and psoriatic skin by immunochemical methods. The VDR were visualized using the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 9A7g to the VDR and the labeled avidinbiotin technique. Immunoreactivity was consistently confined to nuclei in all skin biopsies. In normal skin specimens (n = 10) VDR antigens were expressed in keratinocytes of all epidermal layers (except those of the stratum corneum) and in cells of the epidermal appendages. Double labeling experiments with MoAb to cluster-defined antigens indicated that melanocytes and approximately 75% of Langerhans cells exhibit 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors in normal skin biopsies (n = 5). Depending on their localization in skin compartments 42-62% of CD11b+ positive macrophages and 45-75% of CD3+ T lymphocytes expressed VDR. Non-lesional psoriatic skin specimens (n = 8) revealed nearly identical staining patterns. Lesional psoriatic skin specimens (n = 8) exhibited a significant increase of VDR expression both in basal and suprabasal epidermal layers as measured by computer-assisted morphometry and showed a remarkable change of the immune cell pattern: the densitity and proportion of VDR positive T lymphocytes and macrophages were higher in the epidermal and the perivascular papillary loop compartment. These in vivo findings strongly support the hypothesis that 1,25(OH)2D3 modulates immune response and cell proliferation/differentiation in human skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Onset of symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in relation to age, sex and menopausal transition.

The individual interval between menopause and first symptoms has a Gaussian distribution with mean at time 0, implying that the average woman develops the first symptoms at the time of her menopause. The F:M ratio of all patients was 2.3; with increasing age the F:M ratio decreased from 3.7 before 30 years of age to 1 after the 6th decade of life, with a peak at the age of 40-44 years.

"Delayed detection of congenital hearing loss in high risk infants  OBJECTIVE--To examine the methods used to investigate children at high risk of congenital hearing impairment, and to see whether the introduction of evoked response audiometry has reduced the mean age at which hearing loss is identified. DESIGN--Clinicians who notified children to the national congenital rubella surveillance programme were asked retrospectively to complete a questionnaire examining the methods used to identify hearing impairment and the age at testing in two consecutive five year cohorts. The presence or absence of hearing loss was confirmed by obtaining the results of audiometric evaluations and, whenever possible, a recent pure tone audiogram. SETTING--The United Kingdom. PATIENTS--Children notified to the national congenital rubella surveillance programme and born in 1978-87 in whom IgM specific for rubella was detected shortly after birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The age at which hearing loss was identified and the degree of loss in decibels at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz measured by pure tone audiometry. RESULTS--61 (52%) Of 117 children born in 1978-82 had a hearing impairment of 40 dB or greater in both ears. The mean loss was 93 dB. In the following five years 75 (47%) of 159 children had impaired hearing, their mean loss being 96 dB. The age at which the hearing loss was confirmed decreased from 11.6 to 9.8 months as a result of earlier auditory evoked response testing. Nevertheless, only eight (13%) of the children with hearing impairment born in 1978-82 and 16 (21%) of those born in 1983-7 had these tests performed in the first six months of life. CONCLUSIONS--Unacceptable delays in identifying hearing loss occurred in this high risk group because of failure to arrange auditory evoked response testing in early infancy. Evoked response audiometry is sensitive and specific and should be undertaken within the first few months of life for all infants known to be at risk of sensorineural hearing loss.",Virus_Diseases

"Simian immunodeficiency virus infection of macaque bone marrow macrophages correlates with disease progression in vivo. The pathogenesis of hematopoietic abnormalities associated with infection of susceptible hosts with either simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not fully understood. To determine if bone marrow cells are infected with SIV and if the pattern of viral infection is correlated with the severity of disease and abnormalities in hematopoiesis, 23 SIV-infected rhesus monkeys were examined by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. By immunohistochemistry, only four monkeys were positive for SIV core protein p27, while in situ hybridization revealed viral RNA in the bone marrow of 15 monkeys. Simian immunodeficiency virus RNA was consistently expressed in the bone marrow from monkeys with severe lymphoid depletion (11 of 11), but less so in monkeys with follicular hyperplasia (0 of 2) or mild lymphoid depletion (4 of 10). In animals with mild lymphoid depletion, bone marrow cells infected with SIV were mainly mononuclear cells that appeared to be of myelomonocytic lineage. In contrast, monkeys with severe lymphoid depletion had SIV RNA localized to larger mononuclear cells with abundant cytoplasm often located in small lucent areas of the stroma. These SIV RNA-positive mononuclear cells were positive for the macrophage determinant CD68 as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore the stage of simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome, as indicated by lymphoid morphology, and SIV localization in the bone marrow were correlated with the incidence of anemia, bone marrow hyperplasia, and abnormal distribution of macrophages in the bone marrow. These results indicate that, in common with other animal lentiviral infections, the macrophage is a major target of SIV infections in the bone marrow.",Virus_Diseases

"Antibody to hepatitis C virus in post-transfusion hepatitis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), their relation to outcome, and the seroconversion rate in patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected serum specimens. SETTING: A referral-based university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty-three consecutive patients who developed non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis after open-heart surgery. All patients had follow-up with serial serum testing and clinical evaluation. The mean (+/- SD) duration of follow-up after hepatitis onset was 81 +/- 33 months (range, 13 to 132 months). Seventeen patients recovered after acute-phase illness, whereas 46 developed chronic disease which, in 30 cases, was confirmed histologically. MAIN RESULTS: Of 32 patients tested before transfusion, 1 (3.1%) had anti-HCV. Fifty-nine (93%) patients were anti-HCV positive during acute-phase hepatitis: Patients with ""early"" seroconversion (less than 15 days after hepatitis onset) did not differ from those with ""late"" seroconversion (greater than 60 days after onset) in epidemiologic, clinical, and biochemical features. The rate of anti-HCV positivity during acute-phase illness was not significantly different among patients who recovered (76%) compared with those who developed chronic disease (95%). At 6 to 12 months, patients whose disease resolved had lower antibody activity than those with progressive disease. Further, during long-term follow-up (1 to 9 years), 53% of patients whose disease resolved but only 6.9% of patients who had progressive disease became anti-HCV negative. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is the major cause of post-transfusion hepatitis in Italy.

Four vulvar carcinomas expressed the E6 protein, while all the VINs were negative. Homology to HSV 2 DNA transforming sequences was detected in one vulvar cancer but not in any VIN cases. Positivity to HSV 2 ICSP 11/12 was observed in 33.3% of VIN cases and 75% of invasive cancers. HSV 2 LA1 antigenic determinant was expressed in 33.3% of VIN and 66.6% of cancer cases.",Virus_Diseases
"Pichinde virus infection in strain 13 guniea pigs reduces intestinal protein reflection coefficient with compensation. Pichinde virus inoculation into strain 13 guinea pigs is a model with features reputed to be similar to hemorrhagic fever in humans. Although the infection is lethal by day 13-19, guinea pigs of approximately 600 g do not show edema or effusions. This raises the questions of whether capillary damage is present in such infected animals and, if it is, why edema is absent. The effects of Pichinide virus on protein transport across jejunal capillaries were examined in 38 normal and 7 infected strain 13 guinea pigs 12 days after inoculation. The latter lost 20.3% body weight but maintained normal blood pressure, serum protein concentration, and jejunal lymph flow. However, their protein solvent drag reflection coefficient (sigma) was reduced to .52 +/- .03 (mean +/- SE) from .73 +/- .02 (2P less than .001), while permeability-surface area product was not changed. In the absence of gross edema or effusions, Pichinde virus-infected guinea pigs demonstrated a leaky gut capillary wall to protein compatible with an increase in pore size or large pore number less than sufficient to change permeability-surface area product. Compensatory mechanisms that prevent edema at this stage are efficient and may include reduced capillary pressure or some degree of capillary flow stasis.",Virus_Diseases
"Detection of human immunodeficiency virus DNA and RNA in semen by the polymerase chain reaction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and semen of 23 men infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were examined for the presence of HIV DNA and RNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a nonisotopic detection assay. None of the men was receiving antiretroviral therapy at the time of collection. Semen samples were separated into cell-free seminal fluid, nonspermatozoal mononuclear cells (NSMC), and spermatozoa. All of the PBMC samples, 17 (74%) of 23 NSMC samples, and none of the spermatozoal samples were positive for HIV gag gene DNA. Of 23 cell-free seminal fluid samples, 15 (65%) were positive for HIV gag gene RNA by PCR. Cell-free HIV RNA was more likely to be present in the semen of men with less than 400 than in those with greater than or equal to 400 cells/mm3 (P less than .04) and was present in all patient with p24 antigen in serum. The presence of HIV DNA in NSMC samples was not related to CD4 cell count, disease status, or the presence of p24 antigen in the serum. This study shows that HIV nucleic acid can be detected by PCR in either the cell-free seminal fluid or NSMC of 87% of semen samples but not in the DNA of spermatozoa from HIV-infected men.",Virus_Diseases
"Low HIV-1 proviral DNA burden detected by negative polymerase chain reaction in seropositive individuals correlates with slower disease progression. During 1989, 316 members of a cohort of homosexual men were tested for HIV-specific DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a pair of gag-region primers. Of 125 HIV-seronegative subjects, 123 (98.4%) were PCR-negative while 158 (82.7%) of 191 HIV-seropositive subjects were PCR-positive. Fewer of the 33 subjects who were seropositive and PCR-negative were at Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage IV than the seropositive, PCR-positive subjects (6 versus 25%; P = 0.030). The seropositive, PCR-negative group had higher mean CD4 counts (640 versus 490 x 10(6) cells/l; P = 0.006), higher CD4: CD8 ratios (0.92 versus 0.64; P = 0.004), lower immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels (1290 versus 1645 mg/dl; P = 0.002), lower IgA levels (168 versus 251 mg/dl; P less than 0.001), and lower C1q binding activity (8 versus 14%; P = 0.010) than the seropositive, PCR-positive subjects. The median rate of CD4 cell decline in the 3 years preceding the PCR sample was less marked in the seropositive, PCR-negative group than the seropositive, PCR-positive group (-58 versus -77 x 10(6) cells/l per year; P = 0.028). To control for duration of infection, we restricted the analysis to the subgroups of 11 seropositive, PCR-negative subjects and 34 seropositive, PCR-positive subjects who had seroconverted earlier in the cohort study. Both subgroups had similar durations of infection, yet the same pattern of differences persisted.",Virus_Diseases
"In situ hybridisation with digoxigenin-labelled DNA probes for detection of viral genomes. The applicability of a recently developed non-radioactive DNA labelling and detection method, which uses the digoxigenin (DIG) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system, for the detection of viral infections in pathology specimens by in situ hybridisation, was examined. Its efficacy was compared with that of biotin and radioisotope labelling methods. Three cases of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, two of verruca vulgaris, and seven cases of laryngeal papilloma were studied. The sensitivity of the DIG labelled probe was almost the same as that of a 35S-labelled probe in the dot-blot hybridisation test. Using in situ hybridisation with 35S-labelled and DIG labelled probes, the levels of the hybridised signals detected were similar. The biotin labelled probe was less sensitive, particularly in the cases of laryngeal papilloma. The DIG labelling and detection method was highly sensitive and applicable to the detection of viral infection by ISH, and is preferable to a radiolabelled probe, especially when in situ hybridisation is done in the pathology laboratory.",Virus_Diseases
"Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase expression in foetal skin, inflammatory dermatoses and cutaneous neoplasia. Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is an enzyme expressed by some epithelial neoplasms but not normal interfollicular epidermis. In order to examine the relationship between malignant change and de-differentiation we studied histochemically the expression of GGT in human foetal skin, various inflammatory dermatoses and epidermal neoplasms. In foetal skin GGT was detectable after 7 weeks' gestation, reached a maximum at 11 weeks and was undetectable by 24 weeks. It was expressed strongly by squamous cell carcinoma and focally in Bowen's disease and actinic keratoses. There was no GGT expression in basal cell carcinoma or most benign skin tumours, but keratoacanthomas were weakly positive. Keratinocytes in the vicinity of malignant melanocytes also expressed GGT. This study suggests that GGT expression, while not a simple marker of malignancy, may represent reversion to a less differentiated or 'foetal' phenotype.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Altered cell-mediated immunity to group A haemolytic streptococcal antigens in chronic plaque psoriasis. The proliferative lymphocyte response to sonicated group A, beta-haemolytic streptococci (Strep-A) was measured by thymidine incorporation in 78 patients with psoriasis (guttate, chronic plaque or both). Lymphocytes from 72 of these patients were also cultured with streptokinase/streptodornase (SK/SD), and 20 of the patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were further tested with PPD, Candida albicans and sonicated Streptococcus mutans, a bacterial type not associated clinically with psoriasis. The median stimulation index (SI) of the psoriasis group to the Strep-A preparation was significantly higher than that of a group of 27 non-psoriatic individuals (P less than 0.05). Within this group, only the patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 42) showed a significantly increased proliferative response compared to the non-psoriatic controls (median SI = 123.8 and 31.9, respectively, P less than 0.01). Although the lymphocyte response of the chronic plaque group to SK/SD was also markedly higher than that of the control group, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In addition, these patients did not show significantly increased responses to any of the other antigens tested, including S. mutans. No correlation was observed between the degree of proliferation to Strep-A and disease extent or activity. Similarly, ASO titres, which were raised in 11 out of 23 guttate and three out of nine chronic plaque psoriasis patients tested, did not correlate with the proliferative responses observed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"The incidence of myocarditis in endomyocardial biopsy samples from patients with congestive heart failure. We present the combined experience of three Yugoslavian cardiovascular centers in the application of endomyocardial biopsy for the diagnosis of myocarditis in patients who present clinically with congestive heart failure. The study group comprised 107 patients (mean age, 40.8 years; range, 19 to 61 years). On the basis of patient history and diagnostic tests, the following clinical diagnoses were established: dilated cardiomyopathy (85), myocarditis (16), and alcohol-induced heart disease (6). EMB samples were taken from the left ventricle (95) or both ventricles (12) by use of a King's College bioptome, with a mean of 3.2 samples per patient. Histologic evidence of myocarditis was noted in 10 of 85 patients (12%) with a clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, in 2 of 6 patients (33%) with alcohol-induced heart disease, and in 12 of 16 patients (75%) with a clinical diagnosis of myocarditis. There was confirmation of the clinically suspected diagnosis in 63% of cases, a change of diagnosis based on histology in 15% of cases, and nonspecific findings in 22%. However, useful information was obtained in 78% of the cases, and there was a 22% incidence of histologically proven myocarditis for the entire group. Our results indicate that endomyocardial biopsy is beneficial in determining the true incidence of myocarditis in patients with a clinical presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy.",Virus_Diseases
Regulatory T cell activity specific to human type II and III collagens in rheumatoid arthritis. Fifty-one patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were examined for their immune response potential to human collagen type II and III. It was found that T cells of 57% of patients with RA proliferated to collagen type III whereas only 27% of T cells of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and healthy controls responded to this antigen by proliferation (p less than 0.04). A lower percentage (38%) of patients with RA had proliferative responses to collagen type II in comparison to 17% of responders in healthy controls. The capability to produce T cell helper factors specific to collagen type III was found to be significantly higher in patients treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) (60%) in comparison to patients with OA (16%) and healthy controls (13%). Immunoregulatory drugs affected the specific T helper function in response to collagen type III but did not change the proliferative responses to collagen type II and III in patients with RA. HLA analyses revealed a significant difference in the frequency of HLA-DRw10 between our sample of patients with RA and healthy controls.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Impaired iron uptake and transferrin binding by erythroblasts in the anaemia of rheumatoid arthritis. Serum and bone marrow from 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and five healthy controls were studied in order to establish a possible role of impaired iron uptake and transferrin binding by erythroblasts in the pathophysiology of anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) in RA. Iron incorporation into erythroblasts was reduced in patients with ACD using a method based on incubation of erythroblasts with radiolabelled 59Fe-125I-transferrin. It correlated negatively with C-reactive protein (CRP). In iron deficient RA patients it tended to be reduced as well. These patients had the same level of RA disease activity as in ACD. Transferrin binding by erythroblasts was significantly impaired in ACD compared to controls, although it tended to be reduced in all RA groups. These findings suggest that impaired iron uptake by erythroblasts, probably due to decreased transferrin binding to erythroblasts, might be a pathophysiological factor in ACD in RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Corrosion of modular hip prostheses. Nine uncemented hip prostheses of modular design were revised because of late infection (2 cases), femoral stem loosening or fracture (2), loosening of threaded cups (3) and protrusion of bipolar cups (2). At surgery we found tissue discoloration and macroscopic corrosion in four of the nine prostheses, located at the head-neck junction. Histological examination in most cases showed extensive necrosis associated with metal particles, indicating metal toxicity. Metallographic examination of the prosthetic heads revealed structural imperfections and inhomogeneity of the metal.

"The prevention and management of postdermabrasion complications. The complications of keloids, pigment changes, loss of skin texture, and enlarged facial pores remain a problem with dermabrasion patients. Their occurrence can be reduced by proper patient selection, proper dermabrasion technique, proper wound management, and prompt treatment. Keloids are rapidly resolved with the use of flurandrenolide tape covered with positive-pressure chin-strap dressings. Streaks of hyperpigmentation are lightened with a combination of sunscreen, opaque makeup, tretinoin, and hydroquinone lotions. The loss of skin texture can be prevented by not abrading too deeply and avoiding subsequent bacterial contamination during wound healing.

"Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system in two children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Postmortem examination disclosed central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in two children who died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) at 6 and 14 months of age, respectively. Systemic signs of lymphoma were not present. The B-cell origin and clonality of the neoplastic cells were established by immunohistochemistry in one case and by molecular analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in the other. Moreover, in the latter case the neoplastic cells were characterized by the presence of a single episomal EBV genome. According to these data, the monoclonal B-cell proliferation occurred after EBV infection, thus suggesting a possible pathogenetic role of EBV in the early stages of lymphomagenesis.",Virus_Diseases
"Lack of significant interaction between low dose methotrexate and ibuprofen or flurbiprofen in patients with arthritis. Low dose methotrexate (MTX) is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Current product recommendations accompanying MTX preparations advise against concurrent usage of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), and adverse pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported with this combination. Six patients who were receiving MTX were studied with both oral and parenteral MTX, 10-25 mg/dose, without NSAID and with ibuprofen (2400 mg/day) and flurbiprofen (300 mg/day) for 6 weekly doses. Serum MTX levels were obtained at frequent intervals. Serum was separated and MTX analyzed using a radioimmunoassay (RIA). There was no observable interaction between MTX and either ibuprofen or flurbiprofen, with respect to the area under the curve per unit dose, Cmax, Cmax/dose, Tmax, and serum half-life.

"Complications of Tenckhoff catheters post removal. Complications due to Tenckhoff catheters can occur at prolonged intervals after their removal. From January 1979 to October 1989, 431 patients at our center began continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), 278 of whom subsequently transferred to another form of renal replacement therapy. We identified 12 patients (4.3% or 12/278) with post removal catheter complications. There were 14 post removal complications, two each in two patients, and one in each of 12 others. The mean time to complication was 541 +/- 143 days (27-2,040). In 71% (10/14) of the complications, an abscess was found at the site of the previously removed Tenckhoff catheter. In 29% (4/14) of the complications, foreign body material consistent with a retained cuff was recovered.

Fifty-one of them (93%) had typical herpetic gingivostomatitis, showing a high rate of clinically overt infection. Four outbreaks of herpetic gingivostomatitis were observed during the observation period. Forty-one children were infected with HSV-1 in the outbreaks. The rates of infection in the susceptible children were 81%, 73%, 78%, and 100%, respectively, in the four outbreaks.

"Swine influenza virus infections. Transmission from ill pigs to humans at a Wisconsin agricultural fair and subsequent probable person-to-person transmission. In September 1988, a previously healthy 32-year-old pregnant woman was hospitalized for pneumonia and died 8 days later. The only pathogen detected was an influenza virus antigenically related to the swine influenza virus (SIV). Four days before illness onset, the patient visited a county fair swine exhibition where there was widespread influenzalike illness among the swine. To detect other persons who were possibly infected by contact with the ill swine, we measured serum SIV hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer in 25 swine exhibitors who were 9 to 19 years old. Nineteen (76%) had SIV hemagglutination-inhibition titers of 20 or greater. Antibody was undetectable in serum samples from 25 swine exhibitors from a neighboring county. Additional studies suggest that one to three health care personnel who had contact with the patient developed influenzalike illnesses with laboratory evidence of SIV infection. An outbreak of apparent SIV infection in swine resulted in multiple human infections, and, although no recognized community outbreak resulted, there was evidence of virus transmission from the patient to health care personnel.",Virus_Diseases
"Chronic arterial occlusion with PGE1-resistant skin lesions treated by glycosaminoglycan compound--case reports. The authors report on 2 patients with chronic arterial occlusion in whom the intravenous administration of the glycosaminoglycan compound FPFD 101 was markedly effective.

In these patients, the oral administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in combination with intravenous infusion of prostaglandin E1 was not adequately effective. However, the addition of intravenous injection of FPFD 101 resulted in a marked improvement in their symptoms.

"Advances in imaging of rheumatoid arthritis. Several new imaging modalities have been found useful in clinical evaluation of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has proven to be an excellent noninvasive method to evaluate the spine, shoulder, hip, and knees; its use for the evaluation of smaller joints is still being investigated. In patients with RA, MR imaging has been used to evaluate cervical spine instability, rotator cuff tear, osteonecrosis, and osteomyelitis. Patients with RA may have advanced osteoporosis, predisposing to insufficiency fractures. This includes fractures associated with increased activity after hip or knee arthroplasty. Newer methods for measuring the degree of osteoporosis include single photon absorptiometry, dual photon absorptiometry, quantitative computed tomography (CT), and dual-energy projection radiography. It has not yet been determined which of these methods will be most widely used in the future, but quantitative CT and dual-energy projection radiography currently show the most promise. Ultrasonography provides an excellent noninvasive method for the diagnosis of popliteal cysts, and color Doppler sonography can differentiate cyst and popliteal aneurysm.

"Identification of the target antigen in chronic bullous disease of childhood and linear IgA disease of adults. Disease-associated autoantibodies to basement membrane proteins have been used to characterize structural components of the epidermal basement membrane such as bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) antigen (type VII collagen). The autoimmune bullous diseases characterized by IgA autoantibodies to the basement membrane zone (BMZ), i.e. linear IgA disease of adults (LAD) and chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC) may have circulating antibodies. Previous studies of tissue distribution and ultrastructural binding have suggested that the LAD and CBDC antigens are similar, if not identical, and differ from the target antigens of the other bullous diseases. We present the molecular characterization of the LAD/CBDC antigens by Western blotting of a large series of antisera. Seven of 33 sera (21%) were positive on immunoblotting and bound to the same antigen which has a molecular weight (MW) of 285 kDa. Using both defined polyclonal antisera to BP and LH 7.2 monoclonal antibody to type VII collagen (carboxy terminal) we have shown that the LAD and CBDC antisera both bind to an identical molecular weight protein which clearly differs from both the BP and EBA (type VII collagen) antigens. Although detectable in dermal tissue extracts like EBA, the MW of 285 kDa is heavier than type VII collagen (250 kDa, in our system, using non-collagenous standards).

"Are stressful life events risk factors for herpes zoster? To determine if psychologically stressful life events are risk factors for herpes zoster, we conducted a case-control study of zoster and self-reported recent negative life events and major changes in spousal relationships. The subjects were 101 healthy community-dwelling cases of zoster and 101 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and race and generated by random digit dialing. The Geriatric Scale of Recent Life Events was administered to case and control subjects, and additional questions were asked regarding the perception of the life event. The results showed that case subjects experienced negative life events significantly more often than subjects in the control groups in the 2 months before zoster onset by analysis of discordant pairs (26 versus 10, odds ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13, 6.27, P = .012), 3 months before (29 versus 11, odds ratio 2.64, 95% CI 1.20, 6.04, P = .007), or 6 months before (35 versus 16, odds ratio 2.00, 95% CI 1.04, 3.93, P = .012). The mean number of total life events was significantly higher in cases at 6 months before zoster (case means = 2.64, control means = 1.82, P = .008), but there were no significant differences at 2, 3, or 12 months before. There were no significant differences between case subjects and control subjects for spousal events, or any given single life event. In conclusion, we found that whereas patients with herpes zoster experienced the same kinds of life events in the year preceding the illness as did control subjects, recent events perceived as stressful were significantly more common among patients with zoster.",Virus_Diseases

To determine the economic impact of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) cases on North Carolina hospitals, we collected inpatient data from all North Carolina hospitals on charges and number of patients discharged with these diagnoses. More than 97% of the state's hospitals responded to the survey for the study year (1987-1988). There were 540 AIDS/ARC discharges from 58 North Carolina general hospitals and 125 AIDS/ARC discharges from 13 other types of hospitals, for a statewide total of 665 patients. The total general hospital charges for AIDS/ARC inpatients in North Carolina were approximately $7.7 million per year, and almost $2 million of these charges were uncompensated by any insurance. The greatest burden of cost for this care was borne disproportionately by 15 of the 58 general hospitals, accounting for 82% of the discharges.",Virus_Diseases

"CD4+ monocyte counts in persons with HIV-1 infection: an early increase is followed by a progressive decline. In this study, we asked whether there is a difference in the number of CD4+ and CD4- peripheral blood monocytes as CD4+ T cells decrease during HIV-mediated immunodeficiency. Monocytes and T cells from 90 HIV-positive and 43 HIV-negative persons were analyzed by flow cytometry. The 90 HIV-positive patients represented the entire spectrum of CD4+ T-cell counts. We report that as CD4+ T cells decrease, the number of CD4+ monocytes decrease in parallel. Moreover, significantly higher CD4+ monocyte counts were observed in persons with early stage HIV disease, i.e., greater than 800 CD4+ T cells/mm3, than in HIV-negative persons with greater than 800 CD4+ T cells/mm3. Potential implications of these findings are discussed.",Virus_Diseases
"Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus. There is evidence that hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be vertically transmitted from infected mothers to their children. To test this hypothesis, we prospectively studied 10 pregnant women at high risk from parenterally or sexually transmitted diseases with the polymerase chain reaction. HCV RNA was found in 8 newborn babies delivered by women who were anti-HCV seropositive, and persisted for 2-19 months of follow-up. Anti-HCV detected in 7 infants cleared by 9 months and remained undetectable thereafter. Serum alanine aminotransferase was raised in 3 infants. The findings provide evidence of vertical transmission of HCV and suggest that perinatal infection may initiate a silent disease process or chronic carrier state.",Virus_Diseases
"Treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis with chloroquine. Review of the literature. Systemic corticosteroids may be either contraindicated or not efficacious in treating the cutaneous manifestations occurring in 20% to 35% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis. Chloroquine phosphate has been reported to be a valuable alternative therapy for cutaneous lesions of sarcoidosis. With a judiciously determined daily dosage and regular 6-month ophthalmologic follow-up examinations, the risk of developing retinopathy can be avoided, because the daily dosage rate rather than total dose accumulation determines the development of chloroquine-induced retinopathy.

"Animal models of chronic inflammatory arthritis. The use of animals has been indispensable to the investigation of the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of juvenile arthritis. Because of ethical concerns about studying children, the difficulty of obtaining tissue, and the heterogeneous manifestations and protean course of chronic arthritis in childhood, the scope of potential research has been severely limited. This brief review summarizes a few of the animal models most commonly used in chronic inflammatory arthritis research: subcutaneous air pouch, antigen-induced (including arthritogenic infectious agent), and spontaneous models. In the spontaneous and antigen-induced animal models of arthritis, local and systemic immunoregulatory abnormalities clearly play a major role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. By elucidating the immune response to those antigens, as well as the role of genetics and environment, the pathogenesis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis may be better understood. At the present time, however, the complexity of these models precludes more definitive interpretation and extrapolation to human diseases.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The levels of tryptase in the suction-blister fluid from patients with chronic urticaria, urticaria pigmentosa, cholinergic urticaria, urticarial dermographism, prurigo of unknown origin, eczema, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and from healthy controls were studied. The blister fluid from controls contained up to 15 micrograms/l of tryptase, whereas that from patients with active urticaria contained greater than 50 micrograms/l. This study demonstrates that patients with urticaria have mast cells that readily release tryptase in both the lesional and non-lesional areas of skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Laboratory monitoring of cyclosporine levels: guidelines for the dermatologist. The following guidelines are recommended for laboratory monitoring of circulating levels of cyclosporine in dermatology patients. Measurements should be determined as trough levels in whole blood, not plasma or serum. The measurements should be performed with an assay that is specific for the parent cyclosporine compound (e.g., a high-performance liquid chromatography method or a specific monoclonal immunoassay). The results of nonspecific immunoassays that detect cyclosporine as well as its metabolites are difficult to interpret and cannot readily be compared among different studies or laboratories. In psoriasis patients, the circulating concentration of cyclosporine does not correlate reliably with the therapeutic response. Some patients may achieve an excellent response with blood levels in the range of 50 ng/ml; others may show little or no response despite blood levels as high as 200 ng/ml. In patients with a poor clinical response, monitoring of cyclosporine levels may be useful to confirm that the drug has been taken and may provide an estimate of the degree of absorption and metabolism of the parent compound. Because an upper limit of safety for the circulating concentration of cyclosporine has not been clearly defined, one should attempt to achieve a therapeutic response with the lowest possible dose. Clinicians must carefully monitor patients for signs of cyclosporine toxicity, regardless of the circulating concentration of the drug. Whole blood levels exceeding 250 ng/ml should be avoided.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Acetaminophen does not impair clearance of zidovudine. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether concurrent treatment with acetaminophen and zidovudine impairs clearance of zidovudine, thereby increasing the risk for zidovudine-induced hematologic toxicity. DESIGN: Dose escalation, drug interaction study. SETTING: University clinical research center. PATIENTS: Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or advanced AIDS-related complex. INTERVENTIONS: Acetaminophen and 200 mg of zidovudine simultaneously every 4 hours. For 13 patients, the unit dosage of acetaminophen was 325 mg for 3 days; for 8 patients, the dosage was 650 mg for 3 days; and, for 6 patients, the dosage was 650 mg for 7 days. MEASUREMENTS: Zidovudine clearance and production of the glucuronide conjugate of zidovudine were assessed after acetaminophen treatment. MAIN RESULTS: Neither zidovudine clearance nor production of the glucuronide conjugate of zidovudine was impaired after treatment with acetaminophen. Clearance of zidovudine was actually accelerated by 5%, 11%, and 33% with the three acetaminophen regimens, respectively (P = 0.002 by analysis of variance; P = 0.04 for linear trend when changes in the area-under-the-curve for zidovudine were compared). CONCLUSION: Because serum concentrations of zidovudine decrease after the coadministration of acetaminophen, a pharmacokinetic interaction between zidovudine and acetaminophen is unlikely to increase the risk for hematologic toxicity associated with zidovudine.",Virus_Diseases

"AIDS enteropathy: occult enteric infections and duodenal mucosal alterations in chronic diarrhea  OBJECTIVE: To investigate occult enteric infections and morphologic changes in the small intestine in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and chronic diarrhea of undefined cause. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Referral-based clinic and hospital in tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with advanced HIV infection (19 with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], 3 with AIDS-related complex) with chronic diarrhea, selected because of previously negative stool evaluations for bacterial or parasitic pathogens, were compared with 13 patients with advanced HIV infection (9 with AIDS, 4 with AIDS-related complex) without diarrhea by analysis of endoscopic biopsies using light and electron microscopy, viral culture, and morphometric studies. Both groups were convenience samples and had at least 7 months follow-up. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eleven of twenty-two patients with HIV infection and chronic diarrhea but only 1 of 13 patients without diarrhea showed occult enteric pathogens (that is, undetected by routine studies) after extensive evaluation of duodenal and colorectal biopsies. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and microsporidia were the most common occult agents in study patients with diarrhea (5 each). Patients with diarrhea and occult enteric infections had greater weight loss (mean, 14.3 kg compared with 6.2 kg; P less than 0.05) and shorter survival (1 of 11 compared with 8 of 11 still alive; P less than 0.004) than those with diarrhea but no identified pathogens (defined as ""AIDS enteropathy""). Duodenal morphometry showed decreased villus-to-crypt ratios because of villus atrophy and crypt elongation in HIV-infected patients both with and without diarrhea compared with normal controls (P less than 0.001 for each). All three groups showed comparable frequencies of epithelial mitoses. CONCLUSIONS: Further endoscopic biopsy evaluation of patients with AIDS who had unexplained chronic diarrhea showed an occult infectious cause in half of the cases. However, altered villus and crypt architecture in advanced HIV infection was independent of the presence of diarrhea or enteric infection and therefore did not correlate with AIDS enteropathy. Subnormal epithelial proliferation in response to injury could be a factor, but the underlying cause of the architectural changes remains obscure. We suggest that T-cell dysfunction may play a role.",Virus_Diseases
"Isolation of measles virus in primary rhesus monkey cells from a child with acute interstitial pneumonia who cytologically had giant-cell pneumonia without a rash. The isolation of measles virus in primary Rhesus monkey kidney cells (PRMK) in patients with documented giant-cell pneumonia who have presented without a rash is limited. The diagnosis usually is made by cytologic examination of nasal or bronchial secretions in which characteristic multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are observed. The diagnosis of giant-cell pneumonia has been associated with measles virus but not exclusively. Canine distemper, herpes group viruses, and parainfluenza infections have been associated with these cells. In addition, vitamin A deficiency also has been cytologically associated with multinucleated giant cells. The authors describe the isolation of measles virus from bronchial washing and sputum in PRMK cells at 4 days from an 11-year-old child with acute interstitial pneumonia who was in remission for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Classic cytopathologic effect (CPE) consisting of syncytial and hole formation on the PRMK monolayer was apparent. In addition, a foamy appearance of the monolayer was noted in an otherwise clean lot of monkey cells. Confirmatory testing with measles antibody of the infected areas of the monolayer by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) was positive for measles antigen and negative for mumps, parainfluenza (types I, II, and III) and influenza A and B virus. Serologic studies for measles antibody revealed an IFA IgG titer of greater than 1:10,240, and an IgM titer of 1:128. Cytologic examination of the same bronchial fluid revealed the typical giant cells with characteristic inclusions associated with measles virus. Because this disease usually is severe, and often fatal, prompt recognition of this virus is essential, not only to the patient, who can be treated with immunoglobulin and/or antiviral therapy, but also to prevent the spread of the virus to other patients and medical personnel. These findings also support direct evidence for the etiologic role of measles virus in giant-cell pneumonia that has been detected either histologically or cytologically and in tissue culture at autopsy.",Virus_Diseases
"Development of a new surgical procedure for repairing tracheobronchomalacia. We have developed a new surgical method for repairing tracheobronchomalacia. In experiments on dogs we tried external fixation of Marlex mesh (Bard Cardiosurgery Division, Bellerica, Mass.) on the trachea. We first made models of tracheomalacia by making fractures or resections in intrathoracic tracheal cartilages and then made an external fixation of Marlex mesh on the malacic segments of the trachea. In 11 dogs Marlex mesh was sutured onto the trachea with absorbable thread. The trachea was firmly supported after 2 to 6 months, compared with three controls in which no external fixation was made. However, mucosal defects associated with ischemia caused by the suture developed in four of the 11. In 13 more dogs Marlex mesh was bonded to the trachea with fibrin glue. After 3 to 8 months the supporting strength of the trachea increased up to the level of the normal trachea. There was no evidence of inflammation or of mucosal defects. Therefore Marlex mesh was applied to a 44-year-old-man who had experienced frequent attacks of cough syncope. After the operation the attacks of cough syncope and collapsing of his airway disappeared completely.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Safety and immunogenicity of human rotavirus vaccine strain M37 in adults, children, and infants. Rotavirus vaccine strain M37 (serotype 1), recovered from the stool of an asymptomatic newborn infant and serially passaged in cell culture, was given orally to adults, children, and infants. Serologic responses were detected by neutralization assay or EIA in 59% of 17 adults (10(5)-pfu dose), 55%-60% of 21 infants and children (10(4)-pfu dose), and 70% of 10 infants (10(5)-pfu dose), vaccine virus was shed by 24%, 20%-36%, and 70%, respectively. In adults, neutralizing antibody rises to strain M37 and the related serotype 1 strain Wa occurred with equal frequency (41% vs. 47%). In pediatric subjects, the former were more frequent (36%-40%) than the latter (10%-18%). This was also true of 8 infants who received two doses of vaccine. Mild gastrointestinal illnesses occurred with equal frequency in pediatric subjects who received vaccine or placebo. Thus, strain M37 was well tolerated and immunogenic in young infants, but elicited primarily vaccine-strain-specific rather than serotype-specific neutralizing antibody responses.",Virus_Diseases
"Incidental microvesicular steatosis due to valproic acid anticonvulsant therapy. Valproic acid has been implicated in at least 100 cases of fatal acute liver failure. Most cases have occurred in patients less than 10 yr old; however, at least seven have involved adults. Microvesicular steatosis has been uniformly observed, but its incidence in less severe liver disease and in asymptomatic patients receiving valproate is unknown. We report two patients receiving maintenance valproate, one with resolving acute hepatitis C and the other with chronic persistent hepatitis C, with incidental microvesicular steatosis demonstrated on oil-red O stains. We conclude that microvesicular steatosis does not necessarily signify hepatotoxicity in patients on chronic valproic acid, and should not lead to discontinuation of the drug until other causes of acute or chronic liver disease have been excluded.",Virus_Diseases
"Incidence of cutaneous T cell lymphoma and other rare skin cancers in a defined population.

These cases were identified through a unique computerized retrieval system that is maintained at the Mayo Clinic for the population of Rochester, Minnesota. The annual incidences of these cancers in the Rochester population were 0.9, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.2 per 100,000 residents, respectively (standardized to 1980 U.S. population).

"HIV antigen variability in ARC/AIDS. To define the natural variability of human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen (HIV Ag) over time in untreated HIV-infected patients, we analyzed the percentage change of serum HIV Ag in 40 antigenemic ARC/AIDS subjects receiving placebo in a 24 week clinical trial. When grouped by month of observation, no differences in HIV Ag change were seen among all five 1 month observation periods (p greater than 0.4). After all 105 monthly changes (median of 3 per subject) were pooled, the mean monthly HIV Ag change was 0% change (standard deviation: 77% increase, 44% decrease). Furthermore, HIV Ag changes did not differ among all lengths of observation (from 1 to 5 months using all possible pairwise combinations of HIV Ag levels, p greater than 0.4). CD4 T-cell changes over the whole study did not correlate with HIV Ag changes over the same period. Knowledge of this broad HIV Ag variability should be useful in calculating sample size and in choosing categorical responses unlikely to occur spontaneously in clinical trials of antiviral agents where HIV Ag changes are used as surrogate markers of efficacy.",Virus_Diseases
"Development of vivo of genetic variability of simian immunodeficiency virus. Rapid development of genetic variability may contribute to the pathogenicity of lentiviruses as it may allow escape from immune surveillance and/or from suppression of virus replication. Although apathogenic in African green monkeys, simian immunodeficiency virus isolated from African green monkeys is shown to display extensive genetic variability and defectiveness in the V1- and V2-like variable domains of the external envelope protein comparable to that known for human immunodeficiency virus. However, in contrast to the situation in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals, a predominant major virus variant was detected neither in a monkey naturally infected for more than 10 years nor in two monkeys infected with a molecular virus clone for 15-20 months. Extensive variability evolves from a single genotype with a maximal rate of 7.7 mutations per 1000 nucleotides per year. A remarkable selection for nonsynonymous mutations that accounts for 92% of all changes indicates continuous selection of variants.",Virus_Diseases
"Tropical neuromyelopathies and retroviruses: a review. Debilitating disorders of the nervous system have a relatively high prevalence in the tropics, a geographic region that is often deficient in specialists in the fields of neurology and epidemiology. During World War II, attention was called to a possible nutritional origin for most of these diseases. Recently, however, human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), formerly linked only to a rare form of leukemia (adult T cell leukemia), has been associated with a spastic paraplegia observed mostly in tropical areas and referred to as tropical spastic paraparesis. This entity is also observed in nontropical areas endemic for HTLV-I, including Japan, South America, and the southern United States. Viruses of the HTLV family are being associated increasingly with pathology in humans. The pathogenesis of HTLV-I-associated tropical spastic paraparesis remains to be understood. However, future research is expected to favor a multidisciplinary approach, with exciting potential insights derived from the fields of neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases.

"Identification of regions of HIV-1 p24 reactive with sera which give ""indeterminate"" results in electrophoretic immunoblots with the help of long synthetic peptides. We analyzed nine sera from persons unlikely to be HIV infected which had an IgG reactivity directed against HIV-1 p24, and in two cases also to its precursor p55, but to no other HIV proteins, nor to proteins of the H9 host cell, in electrophoretic immunoblots (EIB). These sera are also referred to as having an indeterminate HIV EIB pattern or as HIV antibody false positive sera. Seven of nine sera reacted with longer (61-77 amino acids) and none with shorter (17-25 amino acids) p24-derived peptides in enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). This is compatible with a conformational (discontinuous) nature of the epitopes involved in many false positive HIV-1 p24 antibody reactions. Four sera reacted with an N-terminal, one with an internal, and two with a C-terminal fragment. Each of the seven sera thus only reacted with one of the long p24 peptides. The specificity and singularity of the reaction was further demonstrated by competition and/or absorption experiments with synthetic peptides. In contrast, 18 of 20 confirmed HIV-1+ sera with p24 reactivity in EIB reacted with at least one and often several of the longer peptides, most frequently the C-terminal one. Thus, the distribution of peptide reactivity of true HIV-1 antibody-positive sera was different from that of the falsely reactive sera. According to two of several explanations, these antibodies may have arisen because of (1) molecular mimicry by chance or by functional selection, (2) immunization by activation, noninfectious exposure, or infection involving non-HIV endogenous or exogenous retroviral antigens. The latter gains some support from our finding of antibody reactions with capsid proteins of the simian viruses, simian sarcoma-associated virus (SSAV), and Mason-Pfizer monkey retrovirus in some of the p24 +/- p55 reactive sera.",Virus_Diseases
"Schnitzler's syndrome: a broader clinical spectrum. Schnitzler's syndrome is characterized by chronic urticaria, recurrent fever, bone pain, and lymphadenopathy in conjunction with a serum IgM M component in a concentration that is usually less than 10,000 mg/L. Complement activation and cryoprecipitation do not appear to be involved. We report two additional patients who share many of the characteristics of this entity. These patients differ from patients previously reported because of the markedly elevated IgM M-component concentration in one patient and the severity of anemia in the second patient. An increased frequency of IgG autoantibodies to interleukin-1-alpha has been reported by other investigators; it has been suggested that an antibody-mediated prolongation of the half-life of interleukin-1-alpha might account for some of the symptoms and signs of this disorder. However, neither the mediators involved in the induction of nonpruritic urticaria nor the role of the IgM M component has been established.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Alpha interferon (2b) in combination with zidovudine for the treatment of presymptomatic feline leukemia virus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome. The therapeutic efficacies of human recombinant alpha interferon (IFN-alpha), IFN-alpha plus zidovudine (AZT), and AZT alone were evaluated in presymptomatic cats with established feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (FAIDS) infection and high levels of persistent antigenemia. Subcutaneous injection of 1.6 x 10(6) U of human recombinant IFN-alpha 2b per kg delivered peak concentrations in plasma of 3,600 U/ml at 2 h postadministration with a half-life of elimination of 2.9 h. This dosage of IFN-alpha could be delivered to cats for up to 12 weeks without significant clinical toxicity. Oral administration of AZT (20 mg/kg three times daily) resulted in peak concentrations in plasma of 3 micrograms/ml at 2 h with a half-life of elimination of approximately 1.60 h. Treatment of FeLV-FAIDS-infected cats with IFN-alpha, either alone or in combination with orally administered AZT, resulted in significant decreases in circulating p27 core antigen beginning 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. AZT alone had no effect on circulating virus antigen. Depending upon whether high (1.6 x 10(6) U/kg)- or low (1.6 x 10(4) to 1.6 x 10(5) U/kg)-dosage IFN-alpha was used, cats became refractory to therapy 3 or 7 weeks after the beginning of treatment. At these times, IFN-alpha-treated animals developed antibodies to IFN-alpha that were neutralizing, specific for human recombinant IFN-alpha, and dose dependent in magnitude. The results of this study indicate that human recombinant IFN-alpha is effective in reducing circulating virus antigenic load in cats persistently infected with FeLV-FAIDS.",Virus_Diseases

"Recurrent aphthous ulcers in association with HIV infection. Description of ulcer types and analysis of T-lymphocyte subsets. This study was conducted to characterize the recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) found in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, to examine evidence for increased severity of the ulcers with HIV disease, and to determine whether increased severity is associated with abnormalities of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets. Seventy-five HIV-seropositive patients with RAU were followed for up to 2 years, and lymphocyte subsets were analyzed in 42. Minor, herpetiform, and major ulcer types were seen, but unexpectedly, 66% of the patients had the usually uncommon herpetiform and major types. These types were temporally associated with symptomatic HIV disease. Patients with major RAU were significantly more immunosuppressed than those with minor or herpetiform RAU in that they had fewer CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes (p less than 0.05). The lesion of RAU is considered to represent a local breakdown in immunoregulation.

"Sun-induced freckles in children and young adults. A correlation of clinical and histopathologic features. Sun-induced freckles are a risk factor for epidermal and melanocytic neoplasia. Whereas sun-induced freckles in children and older adults may be clinically indistinguishable, and sun-induced freckles in older adults usually consist of increased numbers of intraepidermal melanocytes, the histology of sun-induced freckles in children remains unsettled. Using L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-paraffin sections, the authors examined six sun-induced freckles and adjacent nonpigmented skin (ANP) in as many white male subjects, ages 10 to 23 years. Melanocyte frequency was expressed as the ratio of DOPA-reactive melanocytes to total epidermal basal unit cells. For each case, melanocyte frequencies in freckles were significantly greater than in ANP. Cellular atypia of melanocytes was noticed in four of six freckles. Reactivity of melanocytes for HMB-45 was noticed in two freckles studied, compared with no reactivity in three specimens of ANP studied. The authors conclude the sun-induced freckles in the young may consist of a hyperplasia of melanocytes (i.e., similar to solar lentigines in the elderly), sometimes with cellular atypia, and that these findings may be relevant to melanocytic neoplasia.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Antibodies to hepatitis C virus in prospectively followed patients with posttransfusion hepatitis. In an attempt to investigate the incidence and clinical course of type C viral hepatitis among patients with posttransfusion hepatitis, antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in sera were measured from 42 prospectively followed cardiovascular surgery patients who developed hepatitis after blood transfusions. Of these, 35 (83.3%) had anti-HCV seroconversion during a 6- to 12-month follow-up period. The mean interval between blood transfusion and onset of active anti-HCV seroconversion was approximately 3 months after the first elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase levels (18.1 vs. 6.4 weeks). There was no correlation between fluctuations in serum alanine aminotransferase levels and anti-HCV titers. Of 26 patients with type C posttransfusion hepatitis who were followed greater than 1 year, 20 (76.9%) continued to have abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase levels. The results indicate that HCV is the major agent of posttransfusion hepatitis in Taiwan. Furthermore, it plays an important role in chronic hepatitis among transfused patients.",Virus_Diseases
"Influenza vaccination. Are we doing better than we think? Patients who were candidates for influenza vaccination seen in the primary care center of a community teaching hospital were studied to determine whether there is a differential immunization rate depending on risk level. The immunization rate was as follows: moderate risk group, 44%; high risk group, 59%; and very high risk group, 81%. The immunization rate was also closely associated with the frequency of clinic visits, ranging from 34% for those with low visit frequency to 73% for those with high visit frequency. The highest vaccination rates were thus found in the groups at highest risk for influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. Although influenza complication rates are lower in the healthy elderly, this group is so large that the public health impact of a low vaccination rate will be significant. The healthy elderly should be the special targets of future influenza vaccination campaigns.",Virus_Diseases

"Association of HLA-DR4 with a more progressive disease course in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Results of a followup study. The association between HLA-DR antigens and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was investigated in a well-characterized cohort of RA patients who were followed from the beginning of the disease (mean followup 6 years). The frequencies of HLA-DR antigens in patients with possible or probable RA (n = 49) were similar to those in controls. In patients with definite RA (n = 134), the frequencies of DR1, DR4, and DRw53 were increased, whereas the frequencies of DR2, DR3, DRw6, DRw13, and DRw52 were decreased, compared with controls. Comparison of HLA-DR frequencies in patients with definite RA subclassified according to the severity of the disease at the end of the followup period revealed a difference only in the frequency of DR4, which was increased in patients with progressive RA (59.2%) compared with those who had mild RA (34.8%). Further analysis showed that, compared with DR4-negative RA patients, DR4-positive patients had more swollen joints, higher scores on the Ritchie articular index, the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and the Steinbrocker functional classification, more radiologic abnormalities, and more use of second-line drugs. Also, the rate of progression of radiologic abnormalities, functional classification, and use of second-line drugs was higher in DR4-positive patients.

Vaccination before a change in the measles vaccine stabilizer in 1979 (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 28.9) and vaccination before age 15 months (odds ratio, 13.9; 95% confidence interval, 5.9 to 32.6) were identified as risk factors. Revaccination strategies for all students ($3444 per case prevented), students vaccinated before 1980 ($3166 per case prevented), and students vaccinated before age 15 months ($2546 per case prevented) were evaluated, assuming use of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine after the initial case was detected in a school. However, a large proportion of cases (43% to 53%) may not have been preventable using these strategies. Therefore, revaccination in all schools assessed to be at risk for measles may be necessary to prevent large outbreaks until a two-dose vaccination schedule is fully implemented.",Virus_Diseases
"Cost-effectiveness evaluation of measles immunization strategies on a college campus. Since live rubeola vaccine became available in 1963, routine immunization of children at age 15 months has been the recommended strategy for eliminating measles in the United States. However, due to increasing measles outbreaks, especially among previously immunized populations, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recently recommended modifying the one-dose measles vaccination policy to a two-dose schedule, one at 15 months and one at age 5 or 6 years. To address the present college population, ACIP recommended vaccinating all college students who lack proof of immunity. We used the methods of decision analysis to examine the cost effectiveness of implementing such a program in a specific college population, namely, students at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). We developed a model to examine three possible vaccination strategies: ""wait,"" ""screen,"" and ""vaccinate all."" Estimates of probabilities and cost were derived from several outbreaks at UCLA as well as statewide data. In the baseline case, the least expensive strategy is to wait until an outbreak occurs before implementing a vaccination program. The additional cost incurred by screening per measles case avoided is $122,871. However, using sensitivity analysis, we found that the overall cost of elective vaccination strategies is driven by the cost of the vaccine itself. If vaccine could be provided at a nominal cost to the university, a strategy of vaccinating all students without proof of immunity (by either history of two vaccinations or positive titer) would provide the high level of immunity needed to prevent outbreaks and still be most cost effective ($16,644 per measles case avoided).",Virus_Diseases
"Total hip arthroplasty with cement. A long-term radiographic analysis in patients who are older than fifty and younger than fifty years. The long-term performance of a total of 712 Charnley and STH prostheses was evaluated as a function of the patient's age (older than fifty years or younger than fifty years) and of the underlying disease (osteoarthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or avascular necrosis). In patients who were older than fifty years, there were lower incidences of continuous cement-bone radiolucency about the acetabular component (p = 0.04), wear of the polyethylene acetabular cup (p = 0.03), and resorption of the calcar (p = 0.03). However, larger percentages of younger patients had rheumatoid arthritis or avascular necrosis. In the cohort of patients who had osteoarthrosis, the performance of the prosthesis did not differ significantly between older and younger patients; therefore we attributed the differences that were observed to the disease--that is, to rheumatoid arthritis or avascular necrosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Failure of internal fixation of displaced femoral neck fractures in rheumatoid patients. We reviewed the records and radiographs from 10 hospitals to identify 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had sustained 52 femoral neck fractures. Most patients were female (88%), elderly (mean age 66 years) and had had severe polyarticular disease for a mean duration of 16 years. Over half had taken systemic corticosteroids, nearly all were severely osteopenic but few had rheumatoid changes in the hip. Of the 20 fractures treated by internal fixation 12 had complications including nonunion (5), osteonecrosis (5), infection (1), and intertrochanteric fracture (1). Only one of the nine undisplaced fractures required reoperation, but seven of the 11 displaced fractures had revision surgery. Twenty fractures were treated by primary total hip arthroplasty with only one early complication. The other 12 fractures had been treated by hemiarthroplasty (9), hip excision (1) or non-operatively (2). Our results suggest that, in elderly rheumatoid patients, severely displaced femoral neck fractures should be treated by total hip replacement.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Gastric emptying and interdigestive antroduodenal motility in patients with esophageal scleroderma. The study was carried out on two groups of patients with esophageal scleroderma (LES pressure less than 5 mm Hg and amplitude of smooth muscle pressure waves less than 10 mm Hg): one group included patients with mild (group M) and the other severe (group S) gastroesophageal reflux (GER) diagnosed by ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring. Nine normal subjects were used as controls. Antroduodenal motility was recorded by means of manometry for 200-300 min after an overnight fast and the gastric emptying (T1/2) of a semisolid meal was measured utilizing a scintigraphic method. Patients of group S showed a significantly lower incidence of migrating motor complex activity fronts, as well as a more delayed gastric emptying, compared with those of group M. The reason that patients with the same degree of esophageal motor impairment have different degrees of GER may lie in the fact that the concomitant impairment of gastrointestinal interdigestive cyclic clearing activity and the delay in gastric emptying may allow a larger quantity of material to remain stagnant in the gastric lumen, readily available for gastroesophageal reflux.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Seroepidemiology of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I/II in Benin (West Africa). In 1988-1989, a national survey was conducted in Benin to determine the distribution of HTLV-I infection in a representative sample of adult individuals. This study comprised 2625 healthy subjects recruited in the six provinces of Benin and 1300 blood donors from Cotonou and from the other five provinces. Sera were screened for HTLV-I antibody by both immunofluorescence (IF) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Sera positive or doubtful by at least one technique were further analyzed by Western blot and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) when indeterminate. Samples were considered as positive if they reacted with two gene products. No blood donor was positive. Over the 2625 subjects, 39 (1.5%) were positive. We observed a statistical difference between male and female (1%, 2%, p less than 0.05). A difference was also observed according to the areas studied: the HTLV-I antibody rate increased from coastal (0.3%) to northern (5.4%) provinces. HTLV-I seroprevalence increased significantly with age. This survey shows that HTLV-I infection exists in Benin but varies according to regions.",Virus_Diseases
"The chest roentgenogram in pulmonary tuberculosis patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1. To determine the impact that co-infection with HIV has on the radiographic presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis, we examined the chest roentgenograms obtained before treatment in 225 HIV-tested adult Haitians with bacillary (smear or culture or both) positive pulmonary tuberculosis. There were 67 HIV-seropositive and 158 HIV-seronegative patients. Intrathoracic adenopathy alone was more common and parenchymal infiltrates less common in HIV-seropositive patients (p less than 0.05). Although a parenchymal infiltrate was less likely to be cavitating in the HIV-seropositive group (p less than 0.05) when cavitary parenchymal disease was present, HIV seropositivity did not affect the number of cavities (single or multiple) or the size of the largest cavity. Patients with AIDS were significantly more likely to have a chest radiographic pattern consistent with primary tuberculosis (80 percent) than HIV-seropositive patients without AIDS (30 percent), and the latter were significantly more likely to have such a pattern than HIV-seronegative patients (11 percent) (p less than 0.05). The HIV-seropositive patients were equally infectious, regardless of the pattern of disease (primary vs postprimary). Even though pulmonary tuberculosis in an HIV-seropositive adult probably results from reactivation of dormant foci or reinfection, the pattern on the chest roentgenogram often suggests primary disease, especially if the patient has AIDS.",Virus_Diseases
"Clinical analyses and short-term prognoses of neonates with subependymal cysts. Twenty-one neonates with subependymal cysts detected by neurosonography soon after birth were prospectively examined. The clinical and cranial sonographic findings were evaluated with respect to short-term prognosis. The prognosis was poor in 6 patients with congenital viral infection (4 with cytomegalovirus infection and 2 with rubella infection). Five patients also had neurodevelopmental abnormalities (2 with neonatal epileptic seizures, 2 with chromosomal abnormalities, and 1 with lissencephaly). The remaining 10 patients had normal psychomotor development. The incidence of congenital viral infection was statistically correlated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. A correlation did not exist between the short-term prognosis and each of the other clinical factors or cranial sonographic findings. Our evidence suggests that further investigation of possible subependymal cyst etiologies is required during a careful, long-term follow-up period.",Virus_Diseases

"Amebic meningoencephalitis in a patient with AIDS caused by a newly recognized opportunistic pathogen. Leptomyxid ameba. A fatal case of meningoencephalitis due to a leptomyxid ameba in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is presented. This opportunistic organism has not been previously recognized as a human pathogen. A 36-year-old male intravenous drug abuser died after an 18-day hospital course heralded by fever and headache and followed by nuchal rigidity and hemiparesis. Computed tomography of the head showed multiple hypodense lesions. Neuropathologic examination showed that in addition to human immunodeficiency virus encephalomyelitis, there was multifocal meningoencephalitis with trophozoites and cysts morphologically indistinguishable from those of Acanthamoeba. These organisms were also found in the kidneys and adrenal glands. By immunofluorescence, the parasites showed antigenic identity with a free-living leptomyxid ameba and failed to react with any of a spectrum of antiacanthamoeba antisera. This emphasizes the importance of immunofluorescence identification of morphologically indistinguishable ameba species.",Virus_Diseases
"Identification of basement membrane zone antigens defined by antibodies that react to both the epidermal and dermal side of 1 M sodium chloride split skin. Some individuals have basement membrane zone (BMZ) antibodies that react to both the epidermal and dermal side of skin split with 1 M NaCl. To examine the significance of this combined staining pattern, we tested sera from 185 different, sequential, patients with BMZ antibodies for reactivity to normal human skin split with 1 M NaCl. Six sera (3.2%) stained both the epidermal and dermal sides of split skin, 173 (93.5%) stained only the epidermal side, and 6 (3.2%) only the dermal side. All six sera with a combined staining pattern yielded the same pattern when tested with three different specimens of skin, indicating that this pattern is reproducible. By immunoblot analysis, five (83%) of the six combined staining sera reacted to a 160-kD antigen present only in epidermal extracts of normal skin, one reacted in addition to a 230-kD epidermal antigen, and one did not react to either epidermal or dermal extracts. In contrast, five (83%) of the six sera with dermal staining reacted to a 290-kD antigen present only in dermal extracts. Eighteen (90%) of twenty representative epidermal staining sera reacted to a 230-kD epidermal antigen and seven (35%) sera (five with the 230-kD antibody and two without) also reacted to the 160-kD epidermal antigen. Affinity purified antibody to the 160-kD antigen defined by combined staining sera reacted to the BMZ of normal human skin. These results indicate that the combined staining pattern on 1 M NaCl split skin is due to the presence of a distinctive antibody response directed predominantly to a 160-kD BMZ antigen located on the epidermal side of the split skin and to an as yet unidentified BMZ antigen located on the dermal side.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Maturation of human immunodeficiency virus particles assembled from the gag precursor protein requires in situ processing by gag-pol protease. The vaccinia virus expression system was used to determine the role of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease in viral morphogenesis and maturation. The unprocessed p55 gag precursor polyprotein alone was assembled to form HIV-1 particles which budded from cells. The particles were spherical and immature, containing an electron-dense shell in the particle submembrane; there was no evidence of core formation. Expression of both gag and pol proteins from a recombinant containing the complete gag-pol coding sequences resulted in intracellular processing of gag-pol proteins and the production of mature particles with electron-dense cores characteristic of wild-type HIV virions. To ascertain the role of protein processing in particle maturation, the pol ORF in the gag-pol recombinant was truncated to limit expression of the pol gene to the protease domain. With this recombinant expressing p55 gag and protease, intracellular processing was observed. Some of the resultant particles were partially mature and contained processed gag protein subunits. In contrast, particle maturation was not observed when the HIV-1 protease and p55 gag were coexpressed from separate recombinants, despite evidence of intracellular gag processing. These findings suggest that HIV-1 protease must be an integral component of the full-length gag-pol precursor for optimal processing and virion maturation.",Virus_Diseases
"Neuropsychometric performance of asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects. The objective of this study was to determine whether there are measurable differences in neuropsychometric performances between HIV-positive asymptomatic subjects and high-risk HIV-negative individuals. We carried out concurrent neuropsychological testing of HIV-positive subjects screened for drug treatment protocols at a clinical research center and HIV-negative subjects seeking confidential testing. Fifty HIV-negative and 33 HIV-positive subjects who did not admit to use of central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs, more than one drink of alcohol per day, or drug use comprised the final group for analysis. A neuropsychological test battery designed to evaluate verbal memory, motor function, orientation and attention was administered to all subjects. In addition, affective state was assessed with the Beck depression inventory. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated no difference in the performance of the two groups. Only one subtest, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale digit span (forward) reached a level of significant difference (P less than 0.05) by univariate analysis. We conclude that neuropsychometric performance of asymptomatic HIV-positive subjects cannot be distinguished from that of high-risk HIV-negative subjects by a battery of traditional neuropsychological tests.",Virus_Diseases
"Sulphadiazine desensitization in patients with AIDS and cerebral toxoplasmosis. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a sulphadiazine desensitization protocol to treat patients with AIDS and cerebral toxoplasmosis (CT) and known sulphonamide allergy, to ensure that an adequate dose of sulphadiazine (2-4 g/day) was achieved rapidly (within 4-5 days), and to assess the effect of concurrent corticosteroid (CS) administration on the success rate of the regimen. Sixteen patients with CT and a past history or current manifestations of sulphonamide allergy were desensitized to sulphadiazine from October 1988 to December 1989. The protocol employed the oral administration of gradually increasing increments of sulphadiazine 3-hourly over 5 days. Success was defined as tolerance of 2-4 g oral sulphadiazine per day for at least 7 days until death or the present time without any allergic reactions. Our success rated overall was 10 out of 16 patients (62%). Seven patients achieved a final dose of 4 g/day and three a dose of 2 g/day. Concurrent CS administration did not appear to affect the outcome in the small number of patients studied. Our sulphadiazine regimen rapidly, successfully and safely desensitized patients with CT and sulphonamide allergy, allowing the optimal first-line treatment to continue. The aetiology of allergy in HIV-infected patients and the mechanisms by which desensitization works are unknown.",Virus_Diseases

"High rate of infectivity and liver disease in blood donors with antibodies to hepatitis C virus. OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiologic, clinical, serologic, and histologic importance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in blood donors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional identification and prospective evaluation of seropositive donors; retrospective assessment of infectivity; and nested case-control study for risk factors. SETTING: Liver unit of a referral-based university hospital. SUBJECTS: Of 30,231 consecutive donors, 368 (1.2%) were found to be anti-HCV-reactive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Two hundred and fifty-four of these 368 donors were evaluated for risk factors by comparison with 284 age- and sex-matched controls. Eighty-six spouses of seropositive donors were also evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of the seropositive donors had a history of percutaneous exposure to blood. This rate increased to 45% when only those donors confirmed to be anti-HCV positive by a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-2) were considered. A family history of liver disease (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% Cl, 1.6 to 4.8), previous blood transfusion (odds ratio, 6.1; 95% Cl, 3 to 12.5), and a history of tattooing or intravenous drug abuse (odds ratio, 8.4; 95% Cl, 2.3 to 31) were associated with anti-HCV seropositivity. An elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was found in 58% of the seropositive donors. Of the 150 donors tested, 104 (69%; Cl, 62% to 77%) were confirmed by RIBA-2 to be anti-HCV positive. Of the 105 donors who had a biopsy, 16% had normal histologic findings, 11% had minimal changes, 21% had chronic persistent hepatitis, 45% had chronic active hepatitis, and 7% had active cirrhosis. All 77 donors with RIBA-2-confirmed seropositivity had histologic abnormalities. Of 43 donors evaluated in an infectivity study, 82% were implicated in previous HCV transmission. Only 2.3% of the spouses were anti-HCV positive. The ELISA, RIBA-2, and ALT results correlated with infectivity and abnormal histologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: In our geographic area, almost 70% of donors who are anti-HCV positive by ELISA are confirmed to be positive by RIBA-2; most of these donors appear to be chronic carriers of HCV and have substantial liver disease.",Virus_Diseases
"The Foot Function Index: a measure of foot pain and disability. A Foot Function Index (FFI) was developed to measure the impact of foot pathology on function in terms of pain, disability and activity restriction. The FFI is a self-administered index consisting of 23 items divided into 3 sub-scales. Both total and sub-scale scores are produced. The FFI was examined for test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct and criterion validity. A total of 87 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were used in the study. Test-retest reliability of the FFI total and sub-scale scores ranged from 0.87 to 0.69. Internal consistency ranged from 0.96 to 0.73. With the exception of two items, factor analysis supported the construct validity of the total index and the sub-scales. Strong correlation between the FFI total and sub-scale scores and clinical measures of foot pathology supported the criterion validity of the index. The FFI should prove useful for both clinical and research purposes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Lack of transmission of the live attenuated varicella vaccine virus to immunocompromised children after immunization of their siblings. The safety of administering the live attenuated Oka/Merck varicella vaccine to the well siblings of children with malignancy was evaluated as a strategy for reducing the risk of household exposure to varicella among immunocompromised children. Susceptible well children were eligible for vaccination if the child with malignancy had leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumor in remission for 3 months or longer. No evidence of vaccine virus transmission was found among 30 children with malignancy whose 37 healthy susceptible siblings were immunized with varicella vaccine. Varicella-zoster virus was not isolated from the oropharyngeal secretions taken from 17 vaccinees or their 14 immunocompromised siblings. None of the 30 immunocompromised children had vaccine-related rashes or showed immunologic evidence of subclinical varicella-zoster virus infection based on testing for varicella-zoster virus IgG antibodies and T-lymphocyte proliferation to varicella-zoster virus. Four healthy vaccinees eventually had mild breakthrough cases of varicella, with transmission to the high-risk sibling in 3 cases.

Three other case-control studies showed no such relationship, but these did not control for CAD risk factors. The results of two cohort studies were inconclusive. Insufficient data were available from these studies to analyze possible relationships between baldness and CAD risk factors themselves. Overall, the data reviewed suggest that a small risk of CAD due to baldness may exist, but this risk is smaller than that of well-known CAD risk factors such as smoking and hypertension.

"Alveolar macrophages from patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex constitutively synthesize and release tumor necrosis factor alpha. To verify the hypothesis that alveolar macrophages (AMs) from patients infected with HIV-1 could synthesize and release TNF alpha, AMs recovered from the BAL fluid of 11 patients with seropositive HIV-1 (six with AIDS and five with ARC) were tested in vitro for their ability to destroy TNF alpha-susceptible targets. Furthermore, the presence of TNF alpha was assessed in AM-conditioned supernatants on the basis of their cytotoxic activity and by using an immunoenzymatic test and immunoblotting. Transcription of the TNF alpha gene in AMs was also studied by means of the Northern blot analysis. AMs freshly recovered from patients infected with HIV-1 exhibited high levels of cell-mediated cytotoxicity against U937 targets, and the addition of a polyclonal anti-TNF alpha antibody resulted in a significant inhibition of the target lysis. Cell-free supernatants conditioned by unstimulated AMs exerted high levels of cytotoxic activity against TNF alpha-sensitive targets, whereas duplicate, neutralization experiments performed in the presence of an anti-TNF alpha antibody proved that the observed cytotoxic activity was mostly mediated by TNF alpha. The presence of high amounts of TNF alpha in the conditioned media was confirmed by the immunoenzymatic test. In addition, the immunoblot analysis showed that the TNF alpha released by AMs has a Mr 17,000 band, identical to a standard preparation of recombinant TNF alpha. The Northern blot demonstrated that unstimulated AMs express detectable levels of mRNA transcripts for TNF alpha. Taken together, our data support the concept that AMs from patients with HIV-1 infection constitutively release TNF alpha.",Virus_Diseases
"Human hepatocyte growth factor in blood of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Basic aspects. Human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) was purified from the plasma of six patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to hepatitis B in two and non-A, non-B hepatitis in four. The purified hHGF from each patient contained two major protein bands having molecular weights of 79,000 and 86,000 and several minor bands having molecular weights between 76,000 and 92,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed under nonreduced conditions. After reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, three major bands having molecular weights of 58,000, 34,500, and 31,500 were evident. In addition, a band having a molecular weight of 21,000 was detected. hHGF activity was destroyed by its reduction. The hHGF purified from patients demonstrated a dose response in terms of an increase in DNA synthesis using cultured hepatocytes. The hHGF concentration in the plasma of the patients with grade III-IV hepatic coma was calculated to be in the range of 1.8-3.0 nM.

Data from a continuing multiyear seroprevalence survey of human T-lymphotropic virus types I or II (HTLV-I/II) among intravenous drug users in seven U.S. locations were analyzed to detect demographic patterns of seropositivity and coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Seropositivity for HTLV-I/II and HIV-1 was detected by whole-virus enzyme immunoassay, with Western blot confirmation. Of 1,800 subjects recruited from methadone maintenance and detoxification clinics, 207 (11.5%) were infected with HTLV-I/II. Seropositivity for HTLV-I/II varied by racial group, age, sex, and geographic location. Blacks had a higher (age- and location-adjusted) infection rate (17.1%) than Hispanics (8.7%) or whites (5.6%), and seropositivity showed a strong gradient with increasing age. Females had a slightly higher rate (14.0%) than males (10.0%), after adjustment for age and location. Among the seven locations, the rate varied from approximately 1% (Miami and Baltimore) to 20% (Los Angeles), although the former rates were based on relatively few subjects (47 and 65, respectively).

"Cryptosporidiosis facilitated by murine retroviral infection with LP-BM5. LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus infection caused alterations in splenic T cell subsets in adult C57BL/6 female mice. Prolonged infection resulted in increased immunosuppression and a concomitant decreased resistance to Cryptosporidium parvum infection. Significant Cryptosporidium colonization of the intestinal villi was seen 10 days after oral challenge in mice infected with murine retrovirus for 3 months but not in non-virally infected controls. Parasite numbers per villus of retrovirally infected mice were 20-fold higher than in controls, which showed only occasional parasites. Feces from most virally infected mice but none from controls contained oocysts. Cryptosporidium infection in mice after 4 and 5 months of retroviral infection was accompanied by severe immunosuppression and parasite levels 50-5000 times higher than in controls. A high level of infection persisted 21 days after Cryptosporidium challenge in virally infected mice, while controls cleared their transient and marginal infection. These results further characterize LP-BM5 infection as a murine model of retrovirally induced acquired immune deficiency.",Virus_Diseases

"Histiocytes in Sweet's syndrome. The histological features of biopsies from 18 previously unreported cases of Sweet's syndrome are reported. The dermal infiltrate in the majority of the cases contained numerous histiocytes that at first sight appeared to mimic neutrophils. The immunophenotype of these histiocytes was consistent with monocytes that have freshly infiltrated into the lesions. Only two of the cases in this series, associated with leukaemia, displayed the histological features of Sweet's syndrome with a predominant neutrophilic infiltration. We suggest that the initiating mechanisms in Sweet's syndrome are that monocyte/histiocyte-derived cytokines such as the interleukins IL-1 and IL-8, secreted either by infiltrating histiocytes in the non-leukaemia-associated cases of Sweet's syndrome or by tumoural myelomonocytic cells in those associated with leukaemia, are responsible for the systemic manifestations and the infiltration with neutrophils in the skin lesions.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Infarction, hemorrhagic crusts, and ulcers were present in 10% to 25% of the patients and were relatively more common in type I cryoglobulinemia than in the other types. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation was noted in 40%. Lesions on the leg were common in all types of cryoglobulinemia; however, lesions on the head and mucosal surfaces suggested type I cryoglobulinemia. Histopathologic features were classified as vasculitis in 50%, inflammatory or noninflammatory purpura in 15%, noninflammatory hyaline thrombosis in 10%, and postinflammatory sequelae in 10%. Noninflammatory hyaline thrombosis was relatively more frequent in type I. Thus erythematous to purpuric lesions on the legs and leukocytoclastic vasculitis are the common cutaneous findings in cryoglobulinemia. Type I cryoglobulinemia is suggested by noninflammatory hyaline thrombosis, cutaneous infarction, hemorrhagic crusts, skin ulcerations, and lesions of the head and neck and of oral or nasal mucosa.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Anetodermic prurigo nodularis (with Pautrier's neuroma) responsive to arotinoid acid. A woman had symmetrically distributed pruritic nodules for more than 40 years. Microscopically they were characterized by proliferation of nonmyelinated nerve fibers (Pautrier's neuroma) and a total absence of epidermal involvement. Anetoderma developed at the site of former nodules. Her condition responded favorably to repeated retinoid therapy with regression of nodules in those sites in which retinoid dermatitis had developed.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Low-dose dapsone prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS and AIDS-related complex. The efficacy, toxicity and cost of orally administered dapsone (50-100 mg/day) for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were evaluated in 30 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). Six patients received primary and 24 secondary prophylaxis. Ten patients received a maximum dose of 100 mg/day and 20 a maximum of 50 mg/day for a median duration of 19 weeks; 22 of the 30 patients continue to receive prophylaxis as of May 1989. Four patients have died, none of pneumocystis infection. One patient with AIDS suffered a mild relapse while receiving 50 mg/day. Hematologic toxicity was mild and could not be definitively attributed to dapsone therapy; rash due to dapsone was documented in two patients. A review of 33 patients at our institution with a history of PCP who received no prophylaxis demonstrated seven relapses, three of which were fatal. Cost analysis revealed a significant advantage for oral dapsone over aerosolized pentamidine.",Virus_Diseases
"Anxiety and depression in patients with chronic urticaria and generalized pruritus. Thirty-four dermatology out-patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and 34 with idiopathic generalized pruritus were investigated using standardized self-assessment psychological questionnaires to determine the incidence of significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. These patients were compared with age- and sex-matched but otherwise unselected general dermatology out-patients. Using the Beck depression inventory, significantly more patients with generalized pruritus (32.4%) had depressive symptomatology (score greater than 14) than controls (13.2%, P less than 0.05). Although more patients with chronic urticaria had depressive symptomatology (14.7%) than controls (4.4%), the difference was not statistically significant. Using the Speilberger state-trait anxiety inventory there were no significant differences between the patients with pruritus or urticaria and their controls with respect to state or trait anxiety scores above the upper 90% probability limit for the general population. Thus, significant depression may be expected in a substantial proportion of patients with idiopathic generalized pruritus but in a relatively small proportion of those with chronic urticaria.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Absence of human papilloma virus in cervical adenocarcinoma determined by in situ hybridisation. A few studies using DNA technology have suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) may be an aetiological factor for adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. Twenty one cases of cervical adenocarcinoma were studied by in situ hybridisation using biotinylated DNA probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and a streptavidin, biotinylated alkaline phosphatase detection system. Intranuclear HPV DNA was detected in none of the adenocarcinomas, while positive controls gave a clear intranuclear signal. Adjacent areas of normal, koilocytic, and dysplastic squamous epithelium also gave positive results. It may be that squamous epithelium contaminates adenocarcinomas reported as positive by Southern blotting. Our results showing absence of detectable HPV DNA within adenocarcinomas suggest that HPV infection may not have a major role in the aetiology of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix.",Virus_Diseases
"IgG antibody reactivity with Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania antigens in sera of patients with Chagas' disease and leishmaniasis. Sera from 38 Paraguayans with positive skin tests to Leishmania braziliensis panamensis and 51 sera from Paraguayan patients in different stages of Chagas' disease were analyzed by Western blotting using antigen from Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain epimastigotes and from L. b. panamensis promastigotes. Using a single serum sample, distinctive patterns of IgG antibody response to both antigens were identified allowing the differentiation between T. cruzi infection, Leishmania infection, and probable double infection. Sera from patients with T. cruzi infections consistently recognized bands of approximately 25 kDa, 38 kDa, and greater than 97 kDa in T. cruzi antigen lysates and recognized a band of 38 kDa of 66 kDa in Leishmania antigen lysates but did not consistently recognize any bands using T. cruzi antigen. Sera from patients with probable double infections recognized all bands normally detected by individual sera from patients infected with either T. cruzi or Leishmania. In our study population, T. cruzi infection among leishmaniasis patients was as frequent as among individuals free of leishmaniasis.",Virus_Diseases
"Immersion foot. A problem of the homeless in the 1990s. The syndrome of immersion foot is being seen with increasing frequency among the homeless population. It represents the effects of injury by water absorption in the stratum corneum of the skin of the feet. The taxonomy of this disorder is confusing and the many colorful pseudonyms should probably be dropped in favor of a simple classification based on the temperature of the water and the duration of exposure. When uncomplicated by infection or ischemic injury, immersion foot will quickly resolve with conservative measures only. More complicated cases may require antibiotics and surgical treatment. This syndrome may be exacerbated by disturbances of cognition, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, or the use of tobacco or vasoconstrictor drugs such as cocaine. A major contributing factor seems to be lack of shelter in the homeless population. Attention to foot care problems among the homeless and education concerning preventive measures are incumbent on physicians who care for the indigent.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Primary anetoderma associated with a wide spectrum of autoimmune abnormalities. Although the underlying pathologic mechanisms of primary anetoderma have not yet been identified, data suggest the participation of an immunologic mechanism in some cases. In a woman with clinical and histopathologic features of primary anetoderma (Jadassohn-Pellizzari type) of 30 years' duration, laboratory investigation disclosed positive antinuclear factor, hypocomplementemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, granular deposits of immunoreactants along the dermoepidermal junction, and fibrillar deposits in the papillary dermis. In addition, she was found to have autoimmune hemolysis and circulating lupus anticoagulant associated with recurrent deep-vein thrombosis and a history of Graves' disease (starting 5 years after onset of primary anetoderma).

"A double-blind, randomized trial of 0.5% podofilox and placebo for the treatment of genital warts in women. Patient-applied formulations of 0.5% podofilox (podophyllotoxin) were evaluated for the treatment of external genital warts in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Seventy-two women were enrolled and, using a randomized, computer-generated list, assigned to receive either active drug or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Patients were instructed to apply the medication to their external warts twice each day for 3 consecutive days, followed by 4 days without treatment. This cycle was repeated at weekly intervals for a maximum of 4 weeks (and a minimum of 2 weeks). Patients were evaluated weekly for the first month and then at weeks 6 and 10. The number of warts present was recorded and the overall improvement was assessed. The treated area was examined, the patients were questioned about any adverse effects, and standard hematologic/biochemical studies were conducted. The final results showed that podofilox cleared 74% of the total wart count, compared with an 18% regression in the placebo group (P less than .001). The investigators' assessments of improvement correctly distinguished active drug from placebo at every observation point. Local untoward effects were minor and transient. There was no evidence of systemic effects. It is concluded that patient-applied podofilox is a safe and effective therapy for genital condylomata in women. When available, this drug will simplify the treatment of genital warts by providing a patient-applied alternative therapy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A variant of HLA-DR4 determines susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in a subset of Israeli Jews. HLA-DR4 is associated with risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in most populations. In Israeli Jews, in whom the Dw10 subtype of DR4 predominates, no association of RA with DR4 has been found. The inability to detect an association could be due to the high frequency of DR4-Dw10. We used DNA typing with amplification by the polymerase chain reaction and dot-blotting with allele-specific oligonucleotides to determine DR4 variants in 131 Jewish RA patients living in Israel and 134 controls. In both Ashkenazi Jews and non-Ashkenazi Jews, the rare variant Dw15 (previously identified in Japanese populations and in Japanese patients with RA) was found to be the main allele associated with the risk of developing RA (relative risk = 9.2, corrected P less than 0.001). However, this low-frequency allele could be responsible for susceptibility in only 11.5% of the patients. Susceptibility for rheumatoid factor-positive RA was associated with Dw4 and Dw15; the risk for rheumatoid factor-negative RA was associated only with Dw14. The distribution of the HLA-DQ alleles associated with DR4 showed that more than half of the RA patients with Dw15 also had HLA-DQw2. The frequencies of DQw7 and DQw8 were not different in RA patients compared with controls. The results suggest that, as in other populations, susceptibility for the development of RA in Israeli Jews is associated with DRB1 locus alleles of the DR4 group.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Identification and isolation of a phospholipase A2 activating protein in human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid: induction of eicosanoid synthesis and an inflammatory response in joints injected in vivo. Eicosanoids are important mediators of the destructive arthropathy observed in rheumatoid arthritis. The rate-limiting step in the eicosanoid synthesis pathway is the availability of free arachidonic acid. The phospholipase enzymes release arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and thus play an important role in the regulation of eicosanoid production. We have previously demonstrated enhanced phospholipase A2 and C enzyme activities in cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and have also described a phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAP) in mammalian cell lines. In an attempt to determine the biochemical basis of enhanced phospholipase A2 activity found in patients with inflammatory joint disease, we examined synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis for PLAP. To determine whether PLAP was specific for rheumatoid disease, we assayed specimens from patients with other arthropathies. Histologic examination of rheumatoid joint tissue, with the use of immunohistochemical techniques, demonstrated high concentration of PLAP in monocytes, macrophages, chondrocytes, vascular smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. Human PLAP could be biochemically isolated from synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and was found to be similar to PLAP previously isolated from murine and bovine sources. To determine whether PLAP could directly mediate any aspect of inflammatory disease, purified PLAP was injected into rabbit knee joints. This resulted in an acute inflammatory arthritis with synovial cell proliferation and synovial fluid leukocytosis. Purified PLAP also induced eicosanoid formation both in vivo and in vitro. With enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we found more PLAP in synovial fluid specimens from patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with samples from patients with other inflammatory arthropathies as well as osteoarthritis, a noninflammatory arthropathy. These data suggest that PLAP may be responsible, at least in part, for some aspects of the destructive inflammatory arthropathy that is observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The A/Mallard/6750/78 avian-human, but not the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 cold-adapted, influenza A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1) reassortant virus vaccine retains partial virulence for infants and children. Characteristics of avian-human (ah) and cold-adapted (ca) influenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 (H1N1) reassortant vaccine viruses were compared in 37 seronegative adults and 122 seronegative infants and children. The 50% human infectious dose (HID50) in infants and children was 10(2.9) and 10(2.6) TCID50 for the ah and ca vaccine, respectively. The ah influenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 reassortant was reactogenic: 24% of infants and children infected with greater than or equal to 100 HID50 had fever greater than or equal to 39.4 degrees C. Since H3N2 ah vaccines were previously shown to be adequately attenuated, it is reasonable to suggest that the genes that code for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the H1N1 virus apparently influence the reactogenicity of reassortant viruses derived from the avian influenza A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 donor virus. Because this avian virus does not reproducibly confer a satisfactory level of attenuation to each subtype of influenza A virus, it is not a suitable donor virus for attenuation of wild-type influenza viruses. In contrast, the ca A/Ann Arbor/6/60 donor virus reliably confers attenuation characteristics to a variety of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses.",Virus_Diseases
"Transient penetration of the hip joint during in situ cannulated-screw fixation of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Before the routine intraoperative use of fluoroscopy at our institution during procedures to stabilize a slipped capital femoral epiphysis, twenty-five patients (thirty hips) had in situ cannulated-screw stabilization of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis with use of biplane radiography. Thus, a permanent record of the procedure was available for review. Fourteen hips in fourteen patients had an intraoperative episode during which the joint was penetrated by the guide-pin assembly or cannulated screw, or both. This penetration was corrected at the time of the operation. Eleven patients were followed for a minimum of two years (mean, thirty-nine months; range, twenty-four to sixty-three months). All physes went on to closure. None of the patients had clinical or radiographic evidence of chondrolysis. Transient penetration of the hip joint did not lead to chondrolysis in this series. This suggests that a single episode of penetration by a pin or screw, with immediate removal from the joint, is not associated with the development of chondrolysis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Poverty and HIV seropositivity: the poor are more likely to be infected. We analyzed demographic and behavioral risk factors for HIV seropositivity using data from 3601 clients of the main HIV counseling and testing clinic for high-risk people in Seattle, Washington, USA. Clients with lower income were found to be more likely to be HIV seropositive, before and after controlling for other demographic and risk factors with logistic regression. This result supports the hypothesis that the impoverished are at increased risk for HIV infection due to the physical and social circumstances in which their poverty places them.

"Adverse reactions to amantadine prophylaxis of influenza in a retirement home. OBJECTIVE: Controversy exists about the safety of following the recommendation of the Immunization Practice Committee of the Centers for Disease Control that nursing home residents be given amantadine prophylaxis during influenza outbreaks. This study was undertaken to define the incidence of adverse reactions to amantadine in the elderly and to identify risk factors for side effects. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A retirement home which offered amantadine prophylaxis to its residents during a presumed influenza outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 96 elderly residents, 79 accepted the offer of amantadine prophylaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attributable adverse health outcomes as assessed by chart review. RESULTS: 41% of the people receiving amantadine had attributable adverse reactions, of which 22% were classified as severe. Severe adverse reactions were associated with residence in the assisted living section of the facility (P = 0.002), a greater number of underlying diagnoses (P = 0.009), congestive heart failure (P = 0.02), and high serum creatinine (P = 0.02). A person with none of these risk factors had a 7% chance of having a severe adverse outcome compared to a 70% chance for someone with all four risk factors. CONCLUSION: The findings raise concern that the prophylactic administration of amantadine to all elderly residents of nursing and retirement homes may be associated with a high incidence of unacceptable reactions, particularly among less healthy residents.",Virus_Diseases
"CD8+ T lymphocytes and progression to AIDS in HIV-infected men: some observations. The relationship between CD8+ lymphocyte counts and progression to AIDS was studied in 340 HIV-1-seropositive men participating in a population-based prospective study. Overall, the relative hazard for developing AIDS during 60 months of observation was slightly elevated (1.08, P = 0.003), indicating an 8% increase in risk of progression for every 100 CD8+ cell count increment. When the data were analyzed in relation to date of diagnosis, the relative hazard was depressed (0.90, P less than 0.001) for the period 6 months prior to diagnosis, but was close to 1.0 for the period 6-36 months prior to diagnosis. These findings suggest a complex relationship between CD8+ cell counts and progression to AIDS, with the possibility that various subsets of the CD8+ compartment play different roles.",Virus_Diseases

In an open study of the treatment of patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS with zidovudine, we evaluated the response of serum p24 antigen (p24Ag) and antibody to p24Ag (anti-p24) levels. Before treatment, serum from 49 out of 73 (67%) patients was p24Ag-positive, and of these patients 42 received zidovudine 800-1200 mg daily for greater than 4 weeks and had a baseline mean serum level of p24Ag of 119 pg/ml (s.e. 15.7). On zidovudine there was a reduction of p24Ag to 21.12% (s.e. 4.76) of pretreatment values at 3 months; however, there was a subsequent trend for levels after 6 months to increase to greater than 50% of pretreatment levels at 12 months. Serum levels of anti-p24 were measured in 26 patients. Of 16 patients whose serum contained p24Ag and 10 whose serum did not, four and nine, respectively, had detectable levels of anti-p24.

"Interleukin-4 promotes the expansion of skin-infiltrating lymphocytes from atopic dermatitis in vitro. Functional studies of lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis (AD) have so far focused on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), whereas cells at the involved site, the skin, have not been examined. Accordingly, we have developed methods to generate lymphocyte cultures from biopsies of inflammatory skin areas. Skin-infiltrating lymphocytes (SIL) were isolated from skin biopsies of 6 patients with severe AD and expanded in vitro in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) without additional antigens. After 6-10 d in culture, outgrowth of mononuclear cells from biopsy tissue was observed in all cases. Phenotypic analysis of skin-derived cells revealed the predominance of CD4+ T-helper/inducer phenotype in SIL populations. Parallel cultures of SIL and PBMC showed an increase and expansion of CD8+ T cells in cultured PBMC, whereas the CD4+ phenotype was predominant in SIL cultures. As indicated by their expression of HLA-DR and CD25 antigens, most of the SIL were activated and the cells mainly expressed T-cell receptors (TCR) composed of alpha and beta chains. Different strategies for expansion of SIL in vitro were examined. High levels of IL-4 (1,000 U/ml) in combination with IL-2 (50 U/ml or 1,000 U/ml) preferentially promoted growth of SIL derived from AD and were much more effective than IL-2 alone. No cells expanded in cultures with IL-4 alone. SIL grown with high concentrations of IL-4 contained a significant proportion of double-positive CD4+8+ cells. No other marked differences were observed in the distribution of T cell subsets in cultures propagated under different conditions for 21 d. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of growing infiltrating T lymphocytes from inflammatory skin of AD patients. The use of high concentrations of IL-2 in combination with high levels of IL-4 allows a large expansion of these cells and thus represents a useful strategy to expand cells for further functional and molecular biologic studies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase product formation and polymorphonuclear cell degranulation by tenidap sodium in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We studied the effect of tenidap sodium, a new antiinflammatory/antirheumatic drug (120 mg/day for 7 days), on eicosanoid production and neutrophil degranulation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Endogenous prostaglandin E2 levels and ex vivo production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were measured in synovial fluid samples obtained at baseline and 1 week later. We measured peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) degranulation following surface-bound IgG stimulation, a possible 5-lipoxygenase product-mediated event, by determining lactoferrin and elastase release into the culture fluid. We found decreased levels of endogenous prostaglandin E2 as measured by radioimmunoassay, and decreased ex vivo production of LTB4 by PMN as measured by high performance liquid chromatography, in synovial fluid samples from patients who took tenidap. Release of the granule proteins lactoferrin and elastase was decreased in PMN obtained from patients receiving tenidap, as well as in the PMN incubated in vitro with tenidap. Improvement in clinical measures paralleled the biochemical changes. The unique 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory property of tenidap, as measured by LTB4 production and degranulation, suggests that it may have clinical activity which differentiates it from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Isolates were subdivided into six subgroups within group A and three within group B; up to six and often four or more different subgroups were isolated in the same laboratory during the same RSV season. The pattern of group and subgroup isolations varied among laboratories during the same year and between years for the same laboratory. These differences suggest that RSV outbreaks are community, possibly regional, but not national phenomena.

"Injuries of the external ear. Ear injuries occur in people of all ages but predominate in active people such as wrestlers, boxers, and bike riders. The types and extent of injury are a function of the force causing the injury. Shearing forces of moderate intensity cause hematoma formation, whereas greater force causes lacerations or even amputation. Sharp objects cause lacerations determined by the force, direction, and point of impact. The high ratio of surface area to mass makes the auricle vulnerable to extremes of temperature. People participating in high-risk activities should wear protective headgear. The goal of treatment is to restore the normal contours while preventing infection. Hematoma results in disfigurement by organization or chondritis. Evacuation and pressure dressings using sterile technique correct the condition. Second-degree burns are treated by regular cleansing and application of topical antimicrobials. Deeper burns require debridement, biologic dressings, or burying the cartilage subcutaneously for later reconstruction. Simple lacerations are closed under aseptic technique using either skin-to-skin sutures only or sutures of the skin combined with intercartilage sutures. Extensive and complex lacerations require meticulous care to match all fragments and prevent infection or loss of tissue. Bare cartilage must be covered with vascularized tissue. The treatment of total amputation is controversial. Some advocate reattachment as a composite graft using intravenous low molecular weight dextrans and heparin as adjuvants. Mladick dermabrades the amputated pinna, reattaches it with sutures, and then slips it into a pocket of elevated postauricular skin for 2 weeks. Others urge microvascular reanastomosis of the small nutrient vessels. Brent and Byrd separate the cartilage from its overlying skin and envelope it first with vascularized temporoparietal fascia and then a split-thickness skin graft. Chondritis is the most feared complication of injury or surgery of the pinna. It is an aggressive process, and prompt removal of pus and necrotic cartilage is required. Exteriorization and removal of all cartilage is effective but disfiguring. Removal of only affected cartilage and constant irrigation with antibiotic solutions is effective but requires prolonged hospitalization. Iontophoresis of antibiotics into the auricle may be effective and conserve tissue.

Eight of the 13 patients, however, were found to have primary sleep disorders. Four had periodic leg movements during sleep, 3 had sleep apneas, and 1 had a combination of both disorders. The implications of these findings in the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are discussed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. An unusual but favorable association? During the 26th week of a first pregnancy, a 25-year-old woman presented with pruritus suggesting an intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. The pruritus, however, persisted despite the premature delivery of a normal newborn at the 35th week. Moreover, aspartate aminotransferase activity increased, reaching a maximum of 38 times normal level on the 17th day after the delivery. Thus, an acute fatty liver of pregnancy was suspected and confirmed by liver biopsy. This patient appeared to have both intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, an association not previously reported. It is suggested that intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy caused premature delivery, which in turn may have prevented the onset of severe maternal and fetal complications caused by acute fatty liver of pregnancy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A double-blind, vehicle-controlled study of clobetasol propionate 0.05% (Temovate) scalp application in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp psoriasis. The efficacy and safety of clobetasol propionate 0.05% scalp application was evaluated in 378 patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis in a double-blind vehicle-controlled parallel group study. After 2 weeks of twice-daily applications, 81% receiving active drug versus 22% receiving vehicle had clearing of 50% or greater. Complete clearing was seen in 26% with active drug and 1% with vehicle. Local side effects were primarily burning or stinging in 11% and 10% of patients treated on an active or a vehicle regimen, respectively. The morning cortisol levels of 168 patients were checked at baseline and again after 2 weeks of drug therapy. Subnormal morning plasma cortisol values were seen in 5% of the patients receiving active drug and in 5% receiving vehicle; 13% of those taking active drug versus 5% taking vehicle had a 50% or greater decrease in morning cortisol at the 2-week visit compared with baseline values.

"Improved serodiagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection with synthetic peptide antigen from capsid protein. Cloning and expression of hepatitis C virus have allowed the development of immunoassays to detect hepatitis C virus infection. However, currently available recombinant fusion protein C100-3 assays, based on a nonstructural protein of the virus, are limited in sensitivity, particularly for detecting acute infection. In this report seroconversion panels showed that an assay based on synthetic peptides, derived from immunodominant regions of both capsid and nonstructural proteins, accelerated hepatitis C virus antibody detection by 4-10 weeks. In screening, this enzyme immunoassay increased detection from 47% to 64% in plasmapheresis donors with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (greater than 100 international units per liter), from 15% to 24% in anti-hepatitis B core antigen-positive blood donors, and from 28% to 42% in renal dialysis patients when compared with nonstructural peptide-based assays. The screening assay was repeatedly reactive for 27 of 2902 volunteer blood donor samples (0.93%); four sera reacted only with the capsid antigen. The peptide test distinguished true from false positive results in agreement with recombinant immunoblot assay in 96% of blood donor samples repeatably reactive on a recombinant hepatitis C virus enzyme immunoassay.",Virus_Diseases
"Disturbances in the cerebral perfusion of human immune deficiency virus-1 seropositive asymptomatic subjects: a quantitative tomography study of 18 cases. Quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by xenon-133 (133Xe) tomography, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), psychometric tests, and laboratory analyses were performed on 18 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) seropositive asymptomatic subjects. Abnormalities of cerebral perfusion were observed in 16 cases (88%). These abnormalities were particularly frequent in the frontal regions (77% of cases). MRI demonstrated leucoencephalopathy in only two cases. EEG showed only induced diffuse abnormalities in two cases. Psychometric tests showed restricted moderate disturbances in 55% of patients. These disturbances mostly concerned those sectors involved in cognitive functions and memorization. These results indicate that quantitative measurements of CBF by 133Xe-SPECT is capable of detecting abnormalities of cerebral perfusion at a very early stage (Phase II) of HIV-1 infection. These abnormalities are indications of disturbances resulting from unidentified metabolic or vascular lesions. This technique appears to be superior to MRI at this stage of the disease's development. It could provide objective information leading to earlier treatment, and prove useful in evaluating potential antiviral chemotherapy.",Virus_Diseases
"The effect of chloroquine prophylaxis on yellow fever vaccine antibody response: comparison of plaque reduction neutralization test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Weekly oral chloroquine prophylaxis for malaria has been associated with impaired antibody response to intradermal rabies vaccination. Experimental data indicate that chloroquine may inhibit yellow fever virus in vitro, yet there has been no clinical evidence to suggest that antibody response to yellow fever vaccine is impaired by concomitant oral administration of chloroquine. A prospective trial was undertaken to evaluate the antibody response to yellow fever 17D vaccine (Connaught Laboratories) of volunteers who were randomized to taking either chloroquine or no drug. Of fifty subjects, 28 were randomized to taking chloroquine, 22 were randomized to taking no drug. Yellow fever 17D vaccine was administered on day 0 and blood sampled on days 0, 14, 35 and 210. Chloroquine was administered weekly for four weeks. There was no significant difference in peak antibody titer by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) between the group that took chloroquine (mean log peak of reciprocal titer 1.43 +/- SD 0.60) with vaccine subcutaneously compared to vaccine-only group (mean log peak of reciprocal titer = 1.21 +/- 0.55). All fifty subjects seroconverted to yellow fever vaccine by day 210. ELISA testing was also performed on all subjects. The two tests showed good correlation (Spearman r = 0.675), although ELISA readings were positive by day 14 in significantly more subjects (p = .01). We conclude that routine anti-malarial doses of chloroquine do not affect antibody response to yellow fever 17D vaccine. ELISA testing, a less complex and less time-consuming test, correlates well with PRNT and is proposed for additional trials to measure yellow fever 17D vaccine response in flavivirus non-immune subjects.",Virus_Diseases
"Systemic mast cell disease associated with primary mediastinal germ cell tumor. The first known case of systemic mast cell disease associated with a germ cell tumor is reported. Six months after the complete remission of a primary mediastinal germ cell tumor treated by chemotherapy and resection, a young man had a series of episodes of hypotension and syncope and, a few months later, a gastric hemorrhage and coagulation disorder. The diagnosis of systemic mast cell disease was made in view of bone marrow and liver biopsies. A transient circulating heparin-like anticoagulant was noted. The occurrence in a short period of these two unusual conditions, given previous knowledge of hematologic disorders associated with germ cell tumors, suggests that the present association is not a coincidence.

"Treatment of condyloma acuminatum with three different interferon-alpha preparations administered parenterally: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred seventy-eight patients were enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate three interferon-alpha preparations administered parenterally for the treatment of condyloma acuminatum. When all interferon groups were combined and compared with placebo, interferon recipients had greater rates of complete, 75%, 50%, and 25% lesion resolution than did placebo recipients (P = .21, P = .14, P = .02, and P = .02, respectively). Rates of lesion resolution were higher among women than among men, and women were more likely than men to respond to interferon. Virologic measurements in paired lesion biopsies did not correlate with interferon treatment or disease outcome. Although interferon toxicity was observed frequently, no participant withdrew from the study because of side effects, and dosage alterations were not required. Parenterally administered interferon-alpha is more effective than placebo in treating condyloma acuminatum, although rates of complete response are low. Different regimens, including combination therapy, should be evaluated for treatment of this common sexually transmitted disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Human papillomavirus associated with poor healing of episiotomy repairs. A retrospective case-control investigation was conducted for risk factors in 47 parturients whose episiotomies dehisced in the immediate postpartum period.

No difference between subjects and controls was found for age, parity, or medical history. Except for human papillomavirus (HPV), past or present history of sexually transmitted diseases was not a risk factor. However, active lesions, history thereof, or subsequent development of infection with HPV was found in 14 of 47 patients (29.8%) who had episiotomy breakdown, compared with 13 of 94 women (13.8%) who did not experience this complication, a statistically significant difference (P less than .023).

"Long-term treatment of hirsutism: desogestrel compared with cyproterone acetate in oral contraceptives. OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness of 2-year treatment of hirsutism with low estrogen oral contraceptives (OCs) containing nonandrogenic or antiandrogenic progestogen. Evaluation of changes in plasma lipids. DESIGN: Ten patients treated with desogestrel 150 micrograms + 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol, 6 with desogestrel 150 micrograms + 50 micrograms ethinyl estradiol, 10 with cyproterone acetate 2 mg + 35 micrograms ethinyl estradiol. Random allocation. Paired comparisons. Control group: 19 normal women, not treated. SETTING: Academic tertiary care. PATIENTS: Women with hirsutism (idiopathic and/or polycystic ovary), 24 of 26 completed treatment. INTERVENTION: Two-year treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hirsutism score, plasma testosterone, and lipids. RESULTS: Initial hirsutism scores (11.8 +/- 0.6 SE) declined with treatment (-7.2 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.01) to 4.7 +/- 0.6, almost reaching control (3.6 +/- 0.3). Initial plasma cholesterol (4.33 mmol/L +/- 0.30 SE), similar to control (4.78 +/- 0.24), increased slowly over 2 years (+2.04 +/- 0.34, P less than 0.01). High-density lipoproteins cholesterol (1.05 mmol/L +/- 0.04 SE), similar to control (1.12 +/- 0.07), did not change the 1st year and increased at 2 years (+0.57 +/- 0.11, P less than 0.01).

"A chronic granulomatous syndrome of unknown origin. A small clinically distinct group of patients with widespread tissue granulomata are described. The principal presenting symptoms are malaise, fever, and weight loss, although a wide variety of complaints are documented. Pulmonary involvement is uncommon. The granulomata are noncaseating with a few multinucleate giant cells and some surrounding chronic inflammatory infiltrate. There is no evidence of an associated arteritis. The disease has a relapsing and remitting course and although it may require treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, particularly if the kidneys are involved, the prognosis is relatively good. We propose that this entity be called granulomatous syndrome of unknown origin. The characteristics that set this syndrome apart from the other granulomatous vasculitides are discussed. The current limited understanding of granuloma formation does not allow us to propose a definite etiology for this condition. It is emphasized that it is not helpful to encompass it within a label of sarcoidosis. First, it may only serve to confuse the doctor in assessing and treating this very particular group of patients. Secondly, it may hinder future attempts to understand the different pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the various conditions in which granulomata may arise.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Using a rubber-based dental impression material, negative surface impressions were made of demarcated areas of skin and prepared as dry specimens for scanning-electron microscopy. Electron micrographs were taken at low magnification and, using a programmed computer-assisted image analyser, it was possible to represent quantitatively the topography of that particular body site according to the degree of circularity of the various geometric subunits. This technique was most applicable to skin topography with a reliable geometrical pattern of triangles and squares, a feature of hair-bearing surfaces in general and in particular, the antecubital fossa. Using standardized trauma of various types the origin of skin surface markings were found to be located in the dermis.

"Testis cancer. Ichthyosis constitutes a significant risk factor. Testis cancer and ichthyosis are both relatively rare diseases. Hence the finding of six individuals with both these conditions in a small population with testicular cancer is highly conspicuous and indicates some kind of connection among such persons. Despite the identical clinical appearances of their ichthyoses, three of the ichthyotic subjects had no measurable activity of the enzyme, steroid sulfatase (STS) in leucocytes, a distinct characteristic of recessive X-linked ichthyosis (RXLI). However, the remaining three subjects had normal STS activity, a strong indicator of autosomal dominant ichthyosis (ADI). The STS activity in patients with testicular cancer who do not have ichthyosis (N = 30) was also within the normal range. The patients with testicular cancer with no skin disease had elevated serum levels of 4-androstenedione (4-AD), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) but had reduced levels of estrone and estrone sulfate. The other serum parameters measured did not significantly differ from normal levels. In essence, the hormone levels obtained for the patients with ichthyotic testicular cancer followed the same pattern, although their dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and estrone sulfate levels tended to be slightly higher than normal. However, no conspicuous aberrations in any of the parameters examined were observed, and why men with ichthyosis are at high risk for testicular cancer remains an unresolved issue.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Oral melanoma and other pigmented lesions of the oral cavity. This article presents a review of oral malignant melanoma and other oral cavity pigmented lesions. The dismal prognosis for patients with oral malignant melanoma is partly due to patients' delayed recognition of signs of early disease and delayed diagnosis by physicians. Pigmented macules and plaques in the oral cavity, representing the radial growth phase of tumors, often go unrecognized for months or years before tumor invasion. Therefore, if early detection of thin oral melanomas is to be achieved, all pigmented oral cavity lesions should be viewed with suspicion. Biopsies of such lesions are indicated when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain. Prompt aggressive surgical treatment is essential in reducing the morbidity and mortality from oral melanomas.

"Pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory infections in the developing world: respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are the most frequently isolated pathogens in infants and children with acute lower respiratory infection (LRI) in the developed world. Less information is available about their importance in LRI in the developing world, but they are probably important there also. The pathogenesis of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia involves inoculation and early replication in the upper respiratory tract, followed by aspiration into the lower respiratory tract when both the mucosal and systemic immune systems are involved in a specific response. Both disease and recovery reflect processes of viral replication (with attendant cellular destruction) and of immune response (with attendant direct cellular destruction and release of pathogenic, along with beneficial, mediators). Factors predisposing to bacterial superinfection are poorly understood except in animal models. Conditions leading to heightened susceptibility to severe disease in the developed world are particularly common in the developing world. Increasing information on RSV and PIV infections in the developing world will likely point to their importance. Strategies for prevention of severe illnesses due to these viruses will follow from concepts elucidated through animal models and studies of infants in the developed world.",Virus_Diseases

"Prevention of occupational contact dermatitis. Contact dermatitis is the most frequent type of occupational skin disease. Although prevention of contact dermatitis in the workplace should ideally be accomplished through total elimination of cutaneous exposure to hazardous substances, this is often not feasible. Therefore eight basic elements of a multidimensional approach to prevention have been identified. These elements include recognition of potential cutaneous irritants and allergens, engineering controls or chemical substitution to prevent skin exposure, personal protection with appropriate clothing or barrier creams, personal and environmental hygiene, regulation of potential allergens and irritants within the workplace, educational efforts to promote awareness of potential allergens and irritants, motivational techniques to promote safe work conditions and practices, and preemployment and periodic health screening. A comprehensive prevention program based on this multidimensional approach requires the cooperative efforts of employees, employers, engineers, chemists, industrial hygienists, safety and supervisory personnel, union representatives, governmental agencies, and occupational health practitioners.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Relation between skin cancer and HLA antigens in renal-transplant recipients  BACKGROUND. Recipients of renal allografts are at an increased risk for skin cancer. It is also known that recipients who are homozygous for HLA antigens are at an increased risk for certain cancers, as are those who are mismatched with their donors for these antigens. In a case-control study we assessed the relation between skin cancer in renal-transplant recipients and HLA homozygosity and mismatching. METHODS. Of 764 patients who received renal transplants between 1966 and 1988, 66 had squamous-cell carcinoma or basal-cell carcinoma of the skin after transplantation. HLA homozygosity was assessed in all 66 recipients, and HLA mismatching in 39; the results were compared with those in 124 recipients without skin cancer. We also investigated the relation between skin cancer and the use of immunosuppressive drugs. In separate case-control analyses we investigated the influence of exposure to the sun and keratotic skin lesions on the risk of skin cancer. RESULTS. The risk of squamous-cell carcinoma was increased in recipients mismatched for HLA-B antigens; the relative risks were 2.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.5) and 5.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 19.0) with mismatching for one and two antigens, respectively, as compared with no mismatching. Mismatching for HLA-A or HLA-DR antigens had no effect on the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma, and there was no association between mismatches at any of the HLA loci and the occurrence of basal-cell carcinoma. The total doses of azathioprine and prednisone were not associated with the occurrence of skin cancer or with HLA matching. Exposure to sunlight and keratotic skin lesions were strongly associated with skin cancer but not with HLA mismatching. Homozygosity for HLA-DR was more frequent among the patients with squamous-cell carcinoma (relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 4.6) and among patients with 100 or more keratotic skin lesions (relative risk, 4.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 15.1). CONCLUSIONS. HLA-B mismatching is significantly associated with the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma in renal-transplant recipients, as is HLA-DR homozygosity. An indirect effect on the level of immunosuppression does not appear to explain these findings, nor does exposure to sunlight or the number of keratotic skin lesions account for this observation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

We describe a 13-year-old girl with the incomplete type of Behcet's disease who had recurrent oral and genital ulcers, folliculitis, proteinuria and hematuria. Renal biopsy specimens revealed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis with strongly positive IgA deposits in the glomerular mesangial area, which is histologically indistinguishable from primary IgA nephritis. Further studies of the IgA subclasses showed that IgA1 deposits were predominant in the glomerular mesangium. Primary IgA nephritis is thought to be associated with polymeric IgA1. So it appears that there may be a common underlying disease or mechanism involved in both primary IgA nephritis and the IgA nephritis in Behcet's disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Polycystic ovarian disease: contribution of vaginal endosonography and reassessment of ultrasonic diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the superiority of vaginal ultrasonography (US) on the abdominal US for the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). DESIGN: The US pattern of ovaries was prospectively investigated by abdominal US and, whenever possible, by vaginal US. SETTING: Primary care, institutional. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-four women in whom PCOD was suspected on endocrine grounds and 62 other patients presenting with primary hyperprolactinemia (n = 23) or hypothalamic anovulation (n = 39). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Vaginal US allowed a better analysis of the ovarian stroma. RESULTS: The external ovarian features of PCOD were observed by both routes in less than one third of the 144 patients with PCOD. The internal ovarian features of PCOD were much more frequently observed by vaginal US than by abdominal US (polycystic pattern: 66.7% versus 38.1%, P less than 0.05; increased ovarian stroma: 57.1% versus 4.8%, P less than 0.001). In the 62 patients without PCOD, US features of PCOD were observed in less than 10% of them, except for the uterine width/ovarian length ratio less than 1 and the polycystic pattern (abdominal US: 17% and 34%; vaginal US: 11% and 50%, respectively).

"Abnormal erythemal response and elevated T lymphocyte HRPT mutant frequency in Cockayne's syndrome. In three children with Cockayne's syndrome (CS), skin exposed to ultraviolet radiation responded transiently either with erythematous papules or an exaggerated sunburn-like response, without chronic actinic damage. Irradiation monochromator tests demonstrated an abnormal delay or reduction in the threshold to ultraviolet (UVB) irradiation-induced erythema similar to that of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). As with XP there was an elevated frequency of mutants resistant to 6-thioguanine in circulating T lymphocytes. The mutant frequency in a single obligate heterozygote was normal. In contrast to XP, in the two CS individuals studied, adaptive cell-mediated immunity and natural killer cell function were normal. Because the risk of skin cancer is very high in XP but not in CS, the normal immune function in CS provides evidence that immune surveillance may be important in UV tumorigenesis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Haematuria frequency syndrome in patients with positive HIV serology: observations in Zambia. Observations are presented on 9 patients recently treated in the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, for painful urinary frequency, suprapubic pain and microscopic and/or macroscopic haematuria without any demonstrable urinary tract infection. At cystoscopy the bladder mucosa of all patients depicted a highly characteristic, uniformly congested appearance with no demonstrable ulcers; there was no significant reduction in bladder capacity. The histological appearance was essentially non-specific in type with an apparent resemblance to that of interstitial cystitis; mast cells were, however, absent in all specimens. An important feature common to all patients was an associated HIV infection; cytochemistry of the bladder tissue did not reveal an associated cytomegalovirus cystitis. No such case was observed in Zambia prior to the advent of HIV infection and the phenomenon was observed only in seropositive patients. It has been suggested that the virus is likely to be associated with the genesis of the bladder symptoms. The natural history of the disorder, its incidence among the seropositive individuals and its pathogenesis remain unclear.",Virus_Diseases
"Risk factors for acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in the United States and association with hepatitis C virus infection. The Centers for Disease Control conducted intensive surveillance for acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in four sentinel counties over a 7-year period. Testing for antibody to hepatitis C virus was performed with the newly developed enzyme immunoassay. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis remained relatively stable (average, 7.1 cases per 100,000, but there were significant changes in disease transmission patterns. The proportion of patients with a history of blood transfusion declined from 17% to 6%, but the proportion with a history of parenteral drug use increased from 21% to 42%. The proportion of patients with histories of sexual exposure (6%), household exposure (3%), occupational exposure to blood (2%), or hemodialysis (0.6%) did not change over time. Antibody to hepatitis C virus was found in 45% of patients within 6 weeks of onset of illness and in 68% of patients followed up for at least 6 months. Patients with no history of transfusions were just as likely to be positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus as patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis, indicating that hepatitis C virus is the major causative agent of all non-A, non-B hepatitis in the United States.",Virus_Diseases
"Infections in HIV-infected travelers: risks and prevention. OBJECTIVE: To review risks for infection and to outline strategies to protect the health of travelers infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). DATA SOURCES: Original reports and summaries of the geographic distribution and frequency of infections as well as of special risks these infections impose on HIV-infected persons. The recommendations incorporate guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization. STUDY SELECTION: Sources containing the most recent, pertinent information. DATA SYNTHESIS: Infections of the gastrointestinal tract are common in all travelers to developing countries and are likely to be more frequent, severe, and difficult to treat in HIV-infected persons. Prominent among the respiratory tract infections that pose special risks to HIV-infected travelers are influenza, measles, and fungal infections with geographically focal distributions. The most common vector-borne infection, malaria, appears to present relatively little, if any, incremental risk to the HIV-infected traveler. Persons with HIV infection respond less vigorously to vaccines and have a higher frequency of adverse reactions to antimicrobial agents. Nevertheless, immunizations and chemoprophylaxis can reduce the risk for many travel-related infections. Additionally, there are protective measures that travelers can take to minimize exposure to pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: By understanding the risks for disease in different destinations, assessing patients' HIV status, counseling patients about travel plans and personal protective measures, appropriately using vaccines and chemoprophylaxis, as well as instituting early treatment of infection, physicians can help HIV-infected patients to preserve their health during travel.",Virus_Diseases
"Immune sensitization against epidermal antigens in polymorphous light eruption. To get further insight into the pathogenesis of polymorphous light eruption, we studied nine patients with polymorphous light eruption and six healthy persons. Two skin biopsy specimens were obtained from each person, one from previously ultraviolet light-irradiated skin and another one from unirradiated skin. An epidermal cell suspension, skin homogenate, or both were prepared from each specimen. Autologous cultures were made with peripheral blood mononuclear cells combined with irradiated or unirradiated skin homogenate and peripheral blood mononuclear cells combined with irradiated or unirradiated epidermal cell suspension. Cell proliferation was assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. The response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to unirradiated epidermal cells or unirradiated skin homogenate was similar in both patients and controls. However, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with polymorphous light eruption showed a significantly increased proliferative response to both irradiated epidermal cells and irradiated skin homogenate. Our results indicate that ultraviolet light increases the stimulatory capability of polymorphous light eruption epidermal cells in a unidirectional mixed culture with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This suggests that an immune sensitization against autologous ultraviolet light-modified skin antigens occurs in polymorphous light eruption.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Aspirin, hydroxychloroquine, and hepatic enzyme abnormalities with methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis. Levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from 5 centers involved in the Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System were correlated with the use of specific antirheumatic medications. Elevated levels of SGOT and SGPT were most frequent in patients taking salicylates and methotrexate (MTX) and least frequent in patients taking hydroxychloroquine. The combination of MTX and salicylates greatly increased the frequency of abnormal liver enzyme values. In contrast, the addition of hydroxychloroquine to a regimen of either MTX or aspirin essentially eliminated the SGOT and SGPT abnormalities. Results from all 5 centers were consistent and remained so after adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration.

The presence of lipid vacuoles in epidermal keratinocytes has not been reported previously in xanthogranuloma.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Colposcopic evaluation of human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive women. To determine the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on cervical histology, 32 known HIV-seropositive women underwent cervical colposcopic evaluation. All had cervical cytology, colposcopically directed biopsy, and T-cell studies performed. Thirteen of 32 patients (41%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Another 14 of 32 patients (44%) had histologic evidence of cervicitis. Abnormal cytology, noted in only three women, suggested CIN in one and inflammatory atypia in two. All (five of five) patients with a clinical diagnosis of AIDS had CIN, compared with 30% (eight of 27) of non-AIDS HIV-positive patients (P less than .05). Patients diagnosed with CIN had significantly lower CD4 cell counts (221/mm3 versus 408/mm3; P less than .06) and CD4:CD8 ratios (0.33 versus 0.62; P less than .02) than those without CIN. Patients with cervicitis had greater T-cell immunosuppression than did those with normal histology. In addition, patients with AIDS were more likely to have higher-grade lesions than were non-AIDS HIV-seropositive patients. Seven of 12 CIN specimens available for analysis by polymerase chain reaction using consensus sequence primers detected human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, including three patients with three or more HPV types. Our data suggest that abnormal cervical pathology is common among HIV-positive women and that cytologic screening is not predictive of CIN in this population. In addition, the presence and severity of cervical dysplasia correlates with quantitative T-cell function. We strongly recommend that cervical colposcopy be part of the routine management of HIV-seropositive women.",Virus_Diseases
"Role of hepatitis C virus in non-B chronic liver disease. To assess the contribution of the recently identified hepatitis C virus to chronic liver diseases of unknown cause and chronic hepatitis attributed by exclusion to non-A, non-B hepatitis, we tested for antibody to hepatitis C in hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients with a spectrum of chronic liver diseases. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, a marker of hepatitis C infection, was detected with a first-generation radioimmunoassay at the following frequencies in the following patient groups: 69% of transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis; 53% of non-transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis; 26% of hepatitis B surface antigen-negative hepatocellular carcinoma; 8% of cryptogenic cirrhosis; 5% to 7% of autoimmune chronic liver diseases; 19% of patients with miscellaneous types of chronic liver disease; and 0.67% of healthy controls. Among non-transfusion-associated cases, 81% with a history of intravenous drug use but only 18% with occupational exposure as health workers had antibody to hepatitis C virus. Among cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 63% of Japanese patients but only 11% of American patients had evidence of hepatitis C infection. Comparison in a subgroup of 79 serum samples of a second-generation radioimmunoassay with the first-generation assay demonstrated a 12% increase in antibody frequency from 30% to 42%. We conclude that hepatitis C plays a substantial role in transfusion-associated and non-transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in Japan, a limited role in cryptogenic cirrhosis, and essentially no role in autoimmune chronic liver diseases. Application of more sensitive immunoassays will increase the frequency of antibody seropositivity in all subgroups, but relative distinctions among risk groups are likely to remain.",Virus_Diseases
"Contact sensitivity to captafol in BALB/c mice. The fungicide captafol has been reported as causing irritant and allergic contact dermatitis in humans and in guinea pigs. This study investigated the ability of purified captafol to cause contact sensitization in BALB/c mice. Female mice were pretreated with an intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide or saline. Applications of captafol (18.7 or 37.4 mg/ml), dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB; 5 mg/ml) or solvent (4:1 acetone:ethanol mixture) were administered to the shaved abdomen on 2 consecutive days, or on days 1, 2, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Following challenge with captafol (37.4 mg/ml) or DNFB (2 mg/ml) on the right ear 6 days after the last induction, ear thickness ratios (right ear/left ear) were significantly larger after challenge in captafol-induced and DNFB-induced mice compared to control mice. A slightly larger response was observed with the smaller induction dose level of captafol and with multiple inductions over the course of a month. The overall maximum response to captafol was not increased by pretreatment with cyclophosphamide. Histologically, ears from captafol-induced and DNFB-induced mice showed edema and cellular infiltration. This study demonstrated the ability of captafol to produce contact hypersensitivity in the BALB/c mouse.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Adverse reactions to heparin [clinical conference] Heparin is a medication that has gained widespread use in clinical medicine as the therapy of choice for acute anticoagulation in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease. Therapy with heparin is associated with many potential adverse side effects. Heparin-induced skin necrosis is an uncommon complication of heparin therapy that is now believed to be a thrombotic complication of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown, but it is presumed to be immunologically mediated. The diagnosis is frequently one of exclusion.

"Major histocompatibility complex haplotype studies in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with pemphigus vulgaris. Of 26 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with pemphigus vulgaris, 24 (92.3%) carried the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles HLA-DR4, DQw3, of which all were of the subtype DR4, DQw8. From studies of the patients and their families, haplotypes were defined. It was found that, of the patients who carried HLA-DR4, DQw8, 75% carried one or the other (and in one case, both) of two haplotypes [HLA-B38, SC21, DR4] or HLA-B35, SC31, DR4. The former is a known extended haplotype among normal Jews, with a frequency of 0.102, and the latter may also be an extended haplotype in this ethnic group, with a frequency of 0.017 among normal haplotypes from Jews. Of the remaining DR4-positive patients, all but one had a presumed D-region segment (defined as SC21, DR4, DQw8 or SC31, DR4, DQw8 with variable HLA-B) of these haplotypes. Only one patient had DR4, DQw8 without any other markers of the extended haplotypes. The number of homozygotes and heterozygotes for DR4, DQw8 was consistent with dominant but not recessive (P less than 0.01) inheritance of a class II or a class II-linked susceptibility gene for the disease. Since the disease is entirely attributable to the presence of an antibody to an intraepidermal intercellular cement substance, it is likely that the class II susceptibility gene (on [HLA-B38, SC21, DR4, DQw8], HLA-B35, SC31, DR4, DQw8, or their segments, in Jewish patients) controls the production of the antibody as a dominantly expressed immune response gene.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The natural history of HIV-1 infection: staging classifications of disease. We evaluated and compared four staging classification systems for HIV infection in a population-based cohort: (1) a staging based on prodromal clinical criteria; (2) the Walter Reed Staging Classification (WRSC); (3) the immunologic staging system (ISS), and (4) a simple staging based on oral disease and CD4+ T-cell depletion. The staging systems were applied to 386 HIV-infected men in the San Francisco Men's Health Study cohort who did not have AIDS at the baseline examination. After 48-56 months of follow-up the cumulative incidence of AIDS and the cumulative mortality by stage was determined for each staging. Unlike the other systems, the WRSC could not classify a substantial proportion of HIV-infected men (51.9%). The WRSC and ISS include one or more stages which did not appear to be associated with a prognosis substantially different from that of adjacent stages. The simplified staging system based on CD4+ T-cell depletion and oral disease may be the most effective of the systems studied. A more complete understanding of the pathophysiology during the evolution of HIV infection will be required to define a more detailed staging of this disease.",Virus_Diseases
Longterm treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective drug survival study. The longterm use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) was studied in a consecutive sample of 148 patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. A survival analysis was done in which treatment terminations due to side effects and to insufficient therapeutic effect were used as index causes. Cumulative drug 'survival' of indomethacin with treatment terminations due to untoward reactions as endpoints was significantly less compared to naproxen and diclofenac (p less than 0.001). No significant difference with termination due to lack of efficacy as index cause was observed (p greater than 0.90). No influence of sex or age on the drug survival with the different endpoints mentioned above could be established.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Two integrin-binding peptides abrogate T cell-mediated immune responses in vivo. Two VLA proteins (or beta 1 integrins; originally called very late activation antigens) that bind to distinct determinants on fibronectin (FN) are increased on activated immune or memory T cells. VLA-4 binds to the peptide sequence Gly-Pro-Glu-Ile-Leu-Asp-Val-Pro-Ser-Thr (GPEILDVPST in single-letter code) on the alternatively spliced CS-1 form of FN, whereas VLA-5 binds to an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence found on all forms of FN. It has been proposed that the migration of immune T cells out of blood vessels and through connective tissue to a site of antigenic challenge is facilitated by the interaction of such integrins with matrix protein molecules. We have examined directly the role of T-cell integrins in vivo by using the well-characterized, T-cell-mediated contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response to the hapten trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB). We demonstrate that the cells that transfer CHS to TNCB adhere to FN in the presence of Ca2+/Mg2+, and T-cell populations depleted of FN-adherent cells do not transfer immunity. We further show that TNCB-immune T cells treated with the synthetic peptides GPEILDVPST or Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP in single-letter code), ligands for VLA-4 and VLA-5, respectively, lose their ability to mediate this immune response in a murine model, whereas the control peptides Val-Ile-Pro-Asp-Leu-Thr-Glu-Ser-Pro-Gly and Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-Pro have no effect. Neither GPEILDVPST nor GRGDSP significantly inhibited the proliferative response of TNCB-immune T cells in vitro. These data suggest that FN-binding integrins on T cells play a role in the localization of T cells to sites of antigenic challenge in tissue.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Adenovirus colitis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Adenovirus was identified in colonic tissue by transmission electron microscopy or culture in 5 of 67 (7.4%) homosexual men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (51 with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) with diarrhea. Colonoscopy showed the mucosa to be normal in 3 cases and mildly inflamed in 2. Light microscopy showed foci of mucosal necrosis that contained chronic inflammatory cells and degenerating and necrotic epithelial cells with amphophilic nuclear inclusions. By transmission electron microscopy, hexagonal viral particles characteristic of adenovirus were identified within the inclusions. Only 1 patient was concomitantly infected by a second potential enteric pathogen. It was concluded that adenovirus, an uncommon enteric pathogen in immunocompetent adults, causes intestinal pathology and may be associated with diarrheal illness in persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.",Virus_Diseases

"Analysis of beta, gamma, and delta T-cell receptor genes in lymphomatoid papulosis: cellular basis of two distinct histologic subsets. To investigate the histogenesis of lymphomatoid papulosis (LYP), we have analyzed the configuration of the beta, gamma, and delta T-cell receptor (TCR) and Ig genes in DNA from 31 biopsies of 18 patients with this condition and also from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of eight of these patients. Immunoglobulin genes were in a germ-line configuration in all patients, and TCR genes were in a germ-line configuration in six patients. In nine patients, one or two rearranged bands (RB) were detected with both beta and gamma TCR probes and in one patient with beta, gamma, and delta TCR probes. Two patients, in whom beta and delta TCR genes were in a germline configuration, had evidence of multiple discrete rearrangements of gamma TCR genes, consistent with a polyclonal T-cell population. Analysis of multiple biopsies revealed that RB, when present, were identical in different lesions from individual patients. All but one of the peripheral blood samples showed a germ-line configuration. The exception had evidence of a rearrangement of gamma and delta in peripheral blood and a beta and gamma rearrangement within tissue. This study has established that only a proportion of patients with LYP have a monoclonal T-cell proliferation. Correlation with the clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic data revealed that a T-cell clone was limited to patients with Willemze type B LYP or ""mixed type"" LYP, whereas patients with type A LYP consistently showed a germline configuration of TCR genes. This study indicates that in LYP the atypical hyperchromatic cerebriform mononuclear cells of type B invariably constitute a monoclonal T-cell population whereas the atypical CD30 positive type A cells represent a proliferation of cells of non-B, non-T-cell lineage.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Current medicinal approaches to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Aspirin, nonacetylated salicylates, and numerous other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients to decrease joint inflammation and improve function. The choice of medication and its optimum dosage must be individualized because of marked intersubject variations in drug metabolism, excretion, antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy, and susceptibility to adverse effects. Equivalent doses of aspirin and of nonacetylated salicylates are equally antiinflammatory in RA, although the nonacetylated salicylate is a poor inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Chronopharmacology studies suggest that many patients may have better efficacy and fewer side effects with evening doses than with morning doses of certain NSAIDs; however, the optimum time must be individualized by trial and error because some patients do better with other regimens. The gastric, renal, and platelet adverse effects of NSAIDs are related to their inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, and tend to be related to dose and intensity of therapy. Various strategies can minimize the impact of these side effects, such as coadministration of gastric protectants or the use of short half-life NSAIDs to decrease the duration of preoperative NSAID withdrawal needed to ensure adequate platelet coagulation during surgery. An intramuscular analgesic NSAID is now available and is reported to be equivalent to morphine sulfate in some painful postsurgical conditions. Although associated with many problems, chronic corticosteroid therapy is, or has been, a major therapeutic component for many RA patients who consequently are unable to respond adequately to the stresses of general anesthesia and surgery because of complete or partial adrenal insufficiency. These patients must be given appropriate supplemental corticosteroid therapy perioperatively.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Effect of zidovudine and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis on progression of HIV-1 infection to AIDS. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Although used widely, the effectiveness of zidovudine therapy and primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in HIV-1-infected individuals, has not been assessed in a large cohort. We have done an observational study between October, 1986, and October, 1990, of a cohort of 2145 HIV-1-seropositive men and 371 who seroconverted during the study. A Markov chain transitional analysis was used to examine the effect of zidovudine and PCP prophylaxis on the probability of progression of HIV-1 infection to AIDS (after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months) after follow-up visits categorised into one of six disease states. The six starting states were based on CD4+ lymphocyte counts and the presence of HIV-related symptoms. Use of pre-AIDS zidovudine and PCP prophylaxis was associated with significant reductions in rates of progression to AIDS at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months for participants starting with less than 350 CD4+ lymphocytes/microliter. For those starting with 350 or more CD4+ lymphocytes/microliter, non-significant protective trends were seen during 12, 18, and 24 month intervals. In multivariate log-linear models virtually all the treatment effect was due to zidovudine. However, after adjusting for the effects of zidovudine, PCP prophylaxis reduced significantly the probability of progression to a first episode of PCP during 6, 12, 18, and 24 month intervals. This study suggests that early primary PCP prophylaxis is effective in preventing first episodes of PCP, and that the efficacy of zidovudine demonstrated in clinical trials can be translated to the population level.",Virus_Diseases
"IL-1 regulation of transin/stromelysin transcription in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts appears to involve two antagonistic transduction pathways, an inhibitory, prostaglandin-dependent pathway mediated by cAMP, and a stimulatory, protein kinase C-dependent pathway. IL-1, like other agents that have been shown a capacity to induce protein kinase C, is a potent transcriptional activator of the metalloproteinase, stromelysin, in synovial and other fibroblasts. cAMP has been shown to inhibit stromelysin transcription in fibroblasts of nonsynovial origin, and is regarded as an important second messenger for IL-1. In addition to stimulating metalloproteinase transcription, IL-1 also induces PGE2 production in synoviocytes. We determined that rIL-1 alpha led to the time-dependent accumulation of intracellular cAMP in serum-starved rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts, and that the effect was blocked by indomethacin. The cAMP agonists forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and PGE2 suppressed the IL-1 induction of stromelysin; conversely, indomethacin superinduced IL-1-elicited stromelysin mRNA. These results were recapitulated on the transcriptional level in cells transfected with the rat transin/stromelysin promoter in a reporter (CAT) construct. 2',5'-Dideoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, also augmented the IL-1 induction of stromeylsin mRNA, as did H-8, a specific inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Staurosporine and H-7, inhibitors of protein kinase C, blocked the IL-1 induction of stromelysin mRNA. We conclude that IL-1 appears to stimulate at least two transduction pathways in synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and that these have antagonistic effects on the regulation of stromelysin transcription.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The heterogeneity of anticentromere antibodies in immunoblotting analysis. We tested anticentromere antibody positive sera from 37 patients by immunoblotting techniques.

These were a 17 kDa (CENP-A recognized by 34 sera), an 80 kDa (CENP-B recognized by 33 sera), and a 140 kDa polypeptide (CENP-C recognized by 26 sera). There was no disease specific pattern of antigenic polypeptides, although Raynaud's phenomenon was frequent in patients with anti-CENP-B reactivities (p less than 0.01).

Measuring the area of tracings of plaque outlines using image analysis gave a mean involved surface area of 9% and image analysis of whole body photographs gave a mean value of 7%.

"Transforming growth factor alpha expression helps to distinguish keratoacanthomas from squamous cell carcinomas.

Ninety percent of the keratoacanthomas demonstrated a diffuse pattern within tumor lobules in which all but the most peripheral rim of cells were stained. A similar localization of transforming growth factor alpha was not identified in squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, 40% of the squamous cell carcinomas but none of the keratoacanthomas showed focal transforming growth factor alpha immunostaining. Our results suggest that transforming growth factor alpha expression may be a marker of epithelial differentiation and may help distinguish between these two tumors.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Do infectious agents cause rheumatoid arthritis? Although rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been widely suspected to have an infectious etiology, this hypothesis has remained difficult to prove. Epstein-Barr virus, parvoviruses, and retroviruses are considered by some investigators to be the primary candidates. An increasing body of data, on the other hand, appears to implicate bacteria or their products in the syndrome. Important evidence has surfaced in support of this view. Lyme arthritis, a disease caused by a bacterium, can mimic RA. Bacteria and their products have been conclusively linked to many forms of inflammatory ""reactive"" arthropathies. RA-like diseases can be induced in certain inbred strains of rats with bacterial cell-wall fragments, e.g., streptococcal and other bacterial peptidoglycans. Immunologic relationships between host and bacterial peptidoglycans, relevant to RA, have been well documented, e.g., heat shock proteins, bacterial IgG Fc binding proteins, and rheumatoid factors. These data not only support the hypothesis that bacteria may play an important role in RA but also indicate that current concepts of infection and autoimmune disease are broadening and overlapping.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Bacterial phagocytosis and bactericidal activity were significantly enhanced by approximately 50%-70% after preincubation of normal PMNL with G-CSF in concentrations of 1000-4000 units/ml for 10 min at 37 degrees C. G-CSF in similar concentrations enhanced the defective bactericidal activity of PMNL from HIV-1-infected patients by approximately 70%-150% and reached the baseline control PMNL killing. However, G-CSF enhanced neither phagocytosis nor fungicidal activity of normal PMNL against C. albicans blastoconidia. These data demonstrate that G-CSF enhances the antibacterial but not the antifungal activities of human PMNL in vitro and also improves the defective PMNL bactericidal activity of HIV-1-infected patients.",Virus_Diseases

"Human nidogen gene: identification of multiple RFLP and exclusion as candidate gene in a family with epidermolysis bullosa (EBS2) with evidence for linkage to chromosome 1. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of heritable blistering diseases affecting the dermal-epidermal basement membrane zone. We have recently provided evidence for genetic linkage of the molecular defect in a large family with dominant simplex, generalized (Koebner) type of EB (EBS2) to the long arm of chromosome 1. Because human nidogen gene has been mapped to chromosomal locus 1q43 in the human genome, we examined the possibility that nidogen, an integral component of all basement membranes, would be the candidate gene in this family of EBS2. Restriction fragment-length polymorphism, which was shown with several restriction endonucleases to be present within the nidogen gene, was utilized for linkage analyses. The results using an informative PvuII polymorphism as a marker of allelic inheritance supported exclusion of the EBS2 locus from approximately 10 cM in either side of the nidogen locus, when Lod score of -2.0 was taken as the limit of exclusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of examining other families with EB for possible linkage to the nidogen locus.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The diagnosis remains a clinical one and, as such, RA investigations use epidemiologic methodologies. It is now clear that there is an important genetic contribution to the etiology of RA evidenced by the association of the disease with HLA-DR4, an allele of the major histocompatibility complex located on the short arm of chromosome six.

"Extracellular localization of human connective tissue mast cell granule contents. In early phases of cutaneous inflammation, connective tissue mast cell degranulation is associated with apparent secretion and externalization of immunoreactive chymotryptic serine proteinase. To determine whether this event is associated with structural evidence of granule externalization, we studied the sequential evolution of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity in vivo, as well as mast cell degranulation provoked by a variety of stimuli in cultured explants of human skin. By 1 min after intradermal antigen challenge with ragweed extract, mast cell degranulation was associated with apparent extrusion of intragranule constituents into the pericellular connective tissue. Similar features typified cultured skin explants exposed for 45 min to anti-IgE and other mast cell secretagogues (morphine sulfate, calcium ionophore A23187, compound 48/80, and substance P). Once externalized, granule constituents could be identified within the dermal matrix by their rounded contour and structural similarity to solubilized granule matrices remaining within actively secreting cells. These data indicate that externalization of connective tissue mast cell granule contents occurs early after secretagogue exposure, potentially accounting for infrequent documentation of this event in naturally occurring dermatoses. The ability to recognize externalized granule products at a morphologic level should facilitate the understanding of interactions between mast cell-derived mediators and target structures of the dermal microvasculature.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Immunologic parameters in early-stage HIV-seropositive subjects associated with vaccine responsiveness. Twenty-one asymptomatic HIV-seropositive subjects and 20 HIV-seronegative controls were assessed for their serologic response to multiple live attenuated viral, protein (toxoid), and polysaccharide vaccine antigens. Extensive in vivo and in vitro immunologic evaluations were performed. Factors predictive of immunogen responsiveness by HIV-seropositive patients were found by correlating vaccine responses with results of T- and B-cell functional assays. Eleven HIV-seropositive patients (HIV nonresponsive-NR) responded to only one of three vaccines used for analysis (meningococcus, group C; adenovirus 4, 7; and diphtheria-tetanus) compared with the normals, of whom 100% responded to two or more of the same immunogens. Ten HIV-seropositive patients (HIV responsive-R) responded equivalently to normals. The HIV NR group had distinctive immunologic abnormalities predictive of their poor immunogen responsiveness. These included defects in the T-cell helper function despite normalization of T cell number and defective T-cell suppression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in vitro (HIV NR, 30% suppression; HIV R, 73% suppression; and normals, 95% suppression of EBV-driven immunoglobulin production in vitro). The B cells of the HIV NR groups were also abnormal in vivo. The HIV NR patients' B cells were larger and had increased native response to B-cell growth factor evidenced by increased thymidine incorporation.

"Subclinical vulvar papillomavirus infection. Eighty-eight cases of subclinical human papillomavirus (HPV) vulvar infection were detected in a consecutive colposcopic series of 968 women. Three patterns of acetowhite lesions had a 72% predictive value (88/122) for histologically assessed HPV. The prevalence of subclinical vulvar HPV in self-referred patients was 7.9% (73/918); it was 9% (88/968) in the overall series and significantly higher in younger patients (age less than 25 years: 21/106, or 19.8%) or in those with cervical HPV or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (40/100, or 40%). Routine inspection of the vulva after acetic acid lavage in association with a Papanicolaou test might help identify Papanicolaou-test-negative patients at high risk of developing cervical HPV or CIN. Treatment with beta-interferon (2,000,000 IU daily intramuscularly for 10 days) was given to 30 consecutive patients, but the results were poor: regression was observed in only 2 cases.",Virus_Diseases

The patient indicated that he had been treated for pulmonary TB in another city, and he produced for clinic staff his labeled medications, which included isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and ethambutol (EMB). The patient also stated that he was an IV-drug user (IVDU) and previously had tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

"Characterization of long-term survivors of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The Long-term Survivor Collaborative Study Group. Of 4,073 reported patients diagnosed with AIDS from 1978 through 1983, 821 (20%) were not reported to be dead by January 1987. Of these apparent long-term survivors, 780 (95%) were reported from 14 states or from local areas where collaborating health departments conducted special follow-up investigations: 119 (15%) were found to be alive, 475 (61%) were dead, and 186 (24%) were lost to follow-up. Health departments obtained consent to collect additional clinical and laboratory information on 48 of the living patients. Six (13%) had no laboratory evidence specific for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (antibody, antigen, viral isolation, or polymerase chain reaction assay); 41 (85%) had a positive result on at least one test; and one was not tested. Of the 41 infected patients, 25 (61%) had Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and two (5%) had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia as the only AIDS-indicative disease; the remainder had multiple diseases. CD4+ cell counts were low (less than 30% of total T lymphocytes) by the time of enrollment in 34 (87%) of 39 patients tested. When enrolled survivors with KS were compared with KS patients who had died within 2 years after AIDS diagnosis, survivors were less likely to have had other diseases in addition to KS than were nonsurvivors (31% versus 51%). While overall mortality by 1987 for patients diagnosed in 1978-83 was high (92-96%), a small number have survived and were doing relatively well clinically, despite evidence of continued CD4+ cell depression.",Virus_Diseases

Serial biannual cross-sectional assessments of HIV sexual risk indicated a consistent increase in safer sexual practices among homosexual men participating in the Chicago-Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Coping and Change Study (CCS) in 1986-1988. Safer sexual practices were achieved by avoidance of anal sex and less often by consistent use of condoms. Longitudinal patterns of variability in individual behavior were also assessed. After 1 year of follow-up, 53% of the participants maintained safer practices in receptive anal sex, 6% maintained unsafe practices, while 31% relapsed at least once. After 2 years, 45% maintained safer practices, 3% maintained unsafe practices and 47% relapsed at least once. Similar trends were observed in insertive anal sex.",Virus_Diseases
"Comparison of mometasone furoate 0.1% cream and hydrocortisone 1.0% cream in the treatment of childhood atopic dermatitis. We conducted a 6-week randomized, blinded study that compared mometasone furoate 0.1% cream, applied once daily, and hydrocortisone 1.0% cream, applied twice daily, in 48 children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Mometasone furoate, a moderate-potency steroid, produced significantly greater improvement than the low-potency hydrocortisone used twice daily. The difference in therapeutic response was particularly evident in patients with involvement of more than 25% of their body surface area.

"Differing characteristics of human papillomavirus RNA-positive and RNA-negative anal carcinomas. Anal carcinomas were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) RNA transcripts by in situ hybridization using 125I-labeled RNA probes. The HPV transcripts were detected in 73.2% of 41 nonglandular anal carcinomas but in none of six anal or 11 rectal adenocarcinomas. In anal nonglandular carcinomas, no difference in the percentage of tumors that were HPV RNA positive was observed between tumors classed as basaloid carcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. Patients with HPV RNA-negative tumors were significantly older (9.2 years) than those with HPV RNA-positive tumors. Anal intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 in the surrounding epithelium was seen in 14 of 25 assessable HPV RNA-positive tumors and in none of nine assessable HPV RNA-negative tumors. Anal tumors may include two separate clinical and biologic groups distinguished by their dependence, or lack of dependence, on HPV RNA expression for maintenance of the neoplastic state.",Virus_Diseases
"A rapid method for quantitating the frequency of peripheral blood cells containing HIV-1 DNA. This article describes a novel approach to quantitative polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The technique is simple to execute, can be performed in a single tube, and is suitable for automation. In addition, the counting and lysis of low numbers of cells (1-100) can be confirmed by phase contrast microscopy. In this study, the technique was used to determine the frequency of occurrence of DNA from the human immunodeficiency virus (type 1) in leukocyte subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from sero-positive individuals. It was confirmed that the frequency of infected CD4+ T cells varied from 0.01 to 0.0001.

"Increased metacarpal bone mass following 18 months of slow-acting antirheumatic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoporosis in RA is mediated by numerous inflammatory substances. This study was undertaken to see if SAARD could modify the rate of metacarpal bone loss in RA. Combined cortical thickness (CCT) measured at the midshaft of the right second metacarpal was used to calculate bone mass (CA%) using a digitizer. Eighty-one subjects were studied, all of whom had at least three sets of hand X-rays, the last of which was approximately 18 months following initiation of SAARD therapy. There were 12 males and 69 females. The mean age at time of starting therapy was 51 (SD 12) years while the mean duration of disease at the time was 7.6 (SD 8) years. The mean time to referral for SAARD from the general clinic was 2.5 (SD 3) years. The percentage fall in bone mass prior to therapy was 2.51%/day compared to a gain of 0.6%/day after therapy (P less than 0.05). Forty-nine patients were aged over 50 years while 32 were 50 years or younger at the time of study. Comparison showed that in the pretreatment period, the rate of change in CCT and CA% was not significantly dependent age (P less than 0.1). During that therapy, the rate of change in CCT and CA% significantly different in the two age groups. Patients aged over 50 years continued to lose bone, but at a slower rate (P less than 0.05). Patients aged 50 years or less either stopped losing or gained metacarpal bone mass during the study period (P less than 0.005). The time to referral for SAARD and disease duration (comparable in the two age groups) did not have a significant effect on changes in CA% during therapy. Change in bone mass could be predicted by change in disease activity. We conclude that SAARD have a significant sparing effect on metacarpal osteoporosis in RA. This positive effect is masked by the overwhelming influence of age (and menopause) and could be missed. Metacarpal osteoporosis seems a pathophysiologically more useful measure of radiological change in RA than erosions or joint space narrowing.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The mechanism of the cross-reactions may involve photoproducts of piroxicam and L-cysteine, as patients allergic to thiosalicylic acid, who have positive photopatch tests to piroxicam, also had positive patch tests to the irradiated solution of piroxicam plus L-cysteine.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Selective expression of immune-associated surface antigens by keratinocytes in irritant contact dermatitis. The expression of three immunoregulatory surface antigens by epidermal keratinocytes was studied in irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), in order to assess whether keratinocytes have a modulatory role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Biopsies were taken from 48-h patch test reactions to six structurally unrelated irritants, and frozen sections immunolabeled with monoclonal antibodies to the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen, HLA-DR, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and the 88-Kd glycoprotein CD36 (OKM5), as well as to the CD3 (T cells) and CD11a (lymphocyte function associated antigen-1, LFA-1) antigens. We found that there was very limited expression of HLA-DR by keratinocytes, with no correlation between the extent of HLA-DR positivity and the degree of T cell infiltration into the epidermis and dermis, suggesting that interferon gamma may not be a significant mediator of ICD at 48 h. In contrast, keratinocytes showed extensive upregulation of ICAM-1, with an excellent spatial association between ICAM-1 expression and LFA-1 positive leucocytes in the epidermis. This indicates that keratinocyte ICAM-1 induction is not restricted to diseases in which antigen presentation is pivotal, but that it has a generalized role in cutaneous inflammatory reactions, promoting the infiltration of leucocytes into the epidermis. Immunolabeling with OKM5 revealed that CD36 is present to a variable degree on keratinocytes in normal skin. Differential changes in the pattern of keratinocyte expression occurred between irritants, in a manner that suggested that the CD36 antigen does not act as an adhesion molecule in ICD, but rather that its expression is related to the proliferative state of the epidermis. The results of this study demonstrate that immune-associated antigens are selectively expressed on the surface of keratinocytes in 48-h ICD biopsies, implying that these cells play an important regulatory role in the development of the inflammatory response to irritant chemicals.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The loss of contact sensitization in man. Little is yet known about the duration of contact sensitivity, but frequent exposure of a target to allergen seems to reduce skin reactivity. The aim of this study was to study the persistence of a specific contact sensitivity in 66 patients with alopecia areata, previously sensitized to DNCB (31 patients) and SADBE (35 patients) between 1978-1985. Patch tests were performed with 0.020 ml of different concentrations of DNCB or SADBE in acetone (0.05%, 0.10%, 0.20%, 1%). The results were read in a standardized manner. Of 66 patients, 47 (71%) had positive reactions and 19 (29%) negative. 8 of the 19 negative patients had been treated with DNCB, 11 with SADBE. Approximately 1/3 of the patients previously sensitized had lost their original sensitivity, and this did not seem to be time-dependent. This phenomenon seemed to be clinically correlated because the majority of the patients were from the ""low responders"" group. We think that acquired unresponsiveness to topical antigen in man is a possible phenomenon, but that it occurs more rarely than in mice and guinea pigs.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The pathology of heart allograft rejection. The pathologist plays an important role in the care of cardiac transplant recipients. Day-to-day management of immunosuppression is largely dependent on the diagnosis and grading of acute rejection. While noninvasive methods have been tried experimentally, the endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard in monitoring the rejection status of the heart allograft. The diagnosis of rejection, however, is complicated by a variety of other histologic findings, which may be procedural or processing related, due to sampling, or specifically related to transplantation. Failed allografts, whether from autopsy or explantation, provide the opportunity to study short- and long-term changes in the transplanted heart.

"Role of the monocyte-macrophage in influenza virus infection of lymphocytes: implications for HIV infection. Knowledge of the pathogenesis of viruses which are less virulent than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of HIV infection. Influenza virus, an enveloped RNA virus, infects monocyte-macrophages, although the infection is brief and abortive. Isolated purified lymphocytes are completely resistant to infection. In contrast, mixtures of lymphocytes and macrophages can synthesize all virus proteins. Infection requires physical association of monocyte-macrophages and lymphocytes in ""clusters."" These studies with influenza virus suggest that the pathogenesis of virus infections in mixed cell cultures may be very different from that observed in purified cell populations, and they suggest that similar studies should be performed with HIV.",Virus_Diseases
"A controlled trial of intralesional recombinant interferon-gamma in the treatment of keloidal scarring. Clinical and histologic findings. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) suppresses the synthesis of collagen by fibroblasts in vitro and the synthesis of collagen in vivo in animal models. Therefore, recombinant human IFN-gamma was examined for its ability to clinically modify keloids. Subjects were treated by injection of either 0.01 or 0.1 mg of recombinant human IFN-gamma into one lesional site and diluent alone into another lesional site three times per week for 3 weeks. Keloids were measured and photographed before beginning therapy and weekly thereafter. Three days after the final injection, biopsies were performed on treated and control sites. Six of eight subjects who finished the course of treatment demonstrated reduction in size at the treated site with an average reduction in height of 30.4% vs 1.1% for control sites. Lesions treated with recombinant human IFN-gamma demonstrated alterations in both the epidermis and dermis. The epidermis showed thinning of the suprapapillary plates, compact hyperkeratosis, focal or diffuse parakeratosis, exocytosis of lymphocytes, and an increased quantity of mucin. The dermis contained a diminished quantity of thickened collagen bundles and active fibroblasts and an increased number of inflammatory cells and quantity of mucin. These results suggest the feasibility of using IFN-gamma in the treatment of abnormal fibrosis. Dose-ranging studies are required to establish whether IFN-gamma can fulfill a true clinical need in the treatment of keloidal scarring.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Influence of phlebographic abnormalities on the natural history of venous ulceration. Eighty-five limbs in 73 patients with a healed venous ulcer were assessed by ascending and descending phlebography, foot volume plethysmography and transcutaneous oxygen measurements. Forty-four limbs had post-thrombotic changes on ascending phlebography. In 24 (28 per cent) these extended into the femoral vein, while in 20 (24 per cent) only the calf veins were involved. In the 41 limbs (48 per cent) with normal deep veins on ascending phlebography, 11 had evidence of localized incompetence of the calf communicating veins, 14 had either long saphenous incompetence, deep vein reflux to the level of the knee or below, or both of these abnormalities, and 16 limbs had no phlebographic abnormalities. However all limbs had a decreased half volume refilling time on foot volume plethysmography. Limbs with post-thrombotic changes extending into the femoral vein were associated with a significantly longer history of ulceration and more ulcer recurrences than limbs with calf vein damage (P less than 0.05 for each) and limbs with normal deep veins (P less than 0.01 for each). However, these limbs did not have lower transcutaneous oxygen ratios or longer times to achieve ulcer healing. Ascending phlebography identified a group of limbs with extensive post-thrombotic changes in which there was a higher incidence of ulcer breakdown, but this was not associated with a delay in ulcer healing.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Vaccination of cotton rats with a chimeric FG glycoprotein of human respiratory syncytial virus induces minimal pulmonary pathology on challenge. The cotton rat model of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was used to study the safety and efficacy of a chimeric FG glycoprotein that was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus vector. Histologic and virologic examination of vaccinated rat lungs was done after challenge with RSV. When rats were challenged 1 month after vaccination, severe pulmonary inflammation characterized by both a mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltrate and 30%-40% involvement of lung tissue was observed with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine. The FG glycoprotein induced minimal lung inflammation (involving 2%-5% of the lung), while negative controls had 1%-3% lung involvement. Two doses with as little as 20 ng of FG glycoprotein formulated in an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant completely protected the cotton rats from RSV challenge. Thus the chimeric FG glycoprotein is highly immunogenic and induces minimal pulmonary inflammation in the cotton rat model.",Virus_Diseases

"Generation and specificity of monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies against human HIV-specific antibodies. I. Cross-reacting idiotopes are expressed in subpopulations of HIV-infected individuals. In this study we have generated monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies against human monoclonal and polyclonal anti-HIV antibodies in seropositive sera. A human anti-gp41 mAb (H2, IgM kappa) was used to immunize BALB/c mice and to prepare hybridoma anti-antibodies that react with H2 and not with normal human IgM. Similar monoclonal anti-antibodies were made in BALB/c mice immunized with Ig fraction prepared from a pool of HIV-seropositive sera. Both kinds of anti-idiotypic antibodies reacted with antibodies in pools of seropositive sera and with individual seropositive sera but not with normal human Ig or seronegative sera. The Id-positive Ig from single donors were isolated on two different anti-Id immunoabsorbents and shown to bind to p24 and gp120, respectively. The detection and isolation of idiotypically cross-reactive human anti-HIV antibodies from seropositive donors demonstrated, for the first time, the existence of shared Id expressed by antibodies against HIV Ag.

"Herpes zoster myelitis. We studied the clinical (10 patients) and pathological (9 patients) findings in 13 patients with herpes zoster myelitis, all of whom had systemic illnesses associated with immunosuppression. The median interval between the onset of the herpes zoster rash and myelopathic symptoms was 12 days, and the subsequent median interval to maximal deficit was 10.5 days. Presenting neurological symptoms were characteristically ipsilateral to the rash, with motor dysfunction predominating, followed by a spinothalamic and, less often, posterior column sensory deficit. Pathological involvement was most severe in the dorsal root entry zone and posterior horn of the spinal cord segment corresponding to the involved dermatome. There was variable spread both horizontally and vertically in the spinal cord. Direct varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection of neuroectodermal cells, particularly oligodendrocytes, was demonstrated by immunostaining viral antigens (8 cases), and by the presence of Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions (7 cases) and often was associated with focal demyelination (6 cases). In 4 patients a VZV vasculitis was associated with leptomeningitis and haemorrhagic necrosis (spinal cord in 1; brainstem or cerebellum in 3).

"Neuropeptides enhance irritant and allergic contact dermatitis. It is supposed that neuropeptides participate in the regulation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. However, their function in this kind of immune response is not known presently. Therefore, in vivo studies were initiated to test the effect on allergic (ACD) and irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) of the neuropeptides substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and somatostatin (SOM), which are released from afferent neurons in the skin. Each neuropeptide was applied topically at the site of contact with the allergen (oxazolone) or irritant (croton oil) during the challenge and sensitization phase of contact dermatitis. The intensity of the inflammation was measured as an increase of ear-swelling response, which represents the degree of plasma extravasation in the early phase of inflammation. Neuropeptides alone led only to a distinct vasodilation. All three neuropeptides were equally able to increase allergic and irritant inflammation. Even minor irritant stimuli were enhanced. Beyond that, CGRP was able to boost sensitization, whereas SOM and SP did not show any effects on the sensitization process. The results presented demonstrate that neuropeptides increase plasma extravasation independent of the pathogenesis of inflammation and may act as priming substances for other mediators of increased vascular permeability. In addition, CGRP enhances the sensitization process.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Eradication of poliomyelitis: progress in the Americas. In the span of 5 years since the eradication initiative was launched and only 3 years since external funds were made available, PAHO has been able to develop and implement a comprehensive program strategy for polio eradication that includes the following components: achievement and maintenance of high immunization levels (which include the supplemental strategies of national immunization days and mop-up operations); effective surveillance to detect all new cases; and a rapid response to the occurrence of new cases. Despite yearly increases in the number of cases of acute flaccid paralysis reported to the surveillance system, a decline in reported confirmed cases of polio has occurred since 1986 to record low levels in 1989. Cases in 1989 were reported from only 0.7% of the counties in the Americas. The occurrence of 24 wild-type virus isolates in 1989 were limited to only three geographic areas: northwestern Mexico; the northern Andean Region; and northeastern Brazil. At this writing the clock is ticking with only 3 months left to achieve the goal of interrupting transmission by the end of 1990. If the current level of effort is sustained and special efforts are directed at the remaining foci of infection, the eradication of the transmission of wild-type poliovirus from the Americas can be achieved. Continued external financial support will be critical if the effort is to succeed.

"Effects of H1-antihistamine drug regimen on histamine release by nonlesional skin mast cells of patients with chronic urticaria. Profiles of compound 48/80-induced histamine release (HR) from mast cells of uninvolved skin from patients with chronic urticaria (CU) and from a normal control (NC) group were compared, and the effects of anti-H1 medications were assessed versus placebo. Then, patients with CU (15) and NC subjects (10) were randomly assigned to take either hydroxyzine (100 mg/day), terfenadine (120 mg/day), or placebo for 28 days. The effects of such treatment on the clinical response and on the profile of compound 48/80-induced HR during a 4-hour period were analyzed. Treatment with hydroxyzine in patients with CU improved the clinical symptoms and modified the profile of HR; more histamine was recovered at 1 hour (p less than 0.05) and 2 hours (p less than 0.05), as compared with baseline. Terfenadine and placebo had no effect on the clinical response or on the profiles of HR. In the NC group, the amounts of histamine recovered at 1 hour after challenge with compound 48/80 were lower than amounts of the pretherapy values (p less than 0.01). It could be concluded that (1) the profile of HR in patients with CU is reproducible during a period of 28 days, (2) only hydroxyzine modifies both the clinical response and the profile of HR, and (3) anti-H1 compounds decrease the HR in the NC group.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with primary brain tumors. All histologically documented episodes of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in adult patients with primary brain tumors treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, since 1981, were retrospectively reviewed. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was histologically documented 11 times in 10 patients. During the same 8-year interval, approximately 587 adults were seen at the center for a brain tumor, 90% of whom received ongoing therapy. Therefore, in at least 1.7% (10/587) of our patients with brain tumors, P carinii pneumonia developed. The median duration of dexamethasone therapy at the onset of P carinii pneumonia symptoms was 2.75 months. Symptoms began during tapering of steroid therapy in eight episodes.

"A method for the determination of UVA protection for normal skin. Although the UVB portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (290 to 320 nm) is responsible for most of the harmful effects of sunlight on the skin, wavelengths in the UVA region also contribute to photodamage. A simple and rapid clinical test, the sun protection factor determination, is available to assess the sunburn protective effect of a sunscreen, primarily a UVB effect. However, no practical test has been proposed to measure a sunscreen's UVA protection. We described a method for the calculation of UVA protection in normal subjects. The determination of UVA protection involves three steps: (1) the UV absorbance spectrum of the sunscreen on skin is determined spectrophotometrically; (2) a convolution spectrum is calculated by multiplying the solar spectrum with the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage UV Hazard Spectrum; and (3) the sunscreen transmission spectrum is then incorporated into the convolution spectrum to obtain the UVA effectiveness ratio, which can be expressed as the UVA protection percentage. Because the UVA protection percentage value is based both on normal erythemic risk and on standard sunlight, the protection for any product can be easily measured. The procedure is simple, and values generated can be reproduced in other laboratories.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

RESULTS: As compared with stage II and stage III patients, stage IV patients had significantly higher mean TBG and total thyroxine (TT4) values, similar and normal total triiodothyronine (TT3) levels, and similar and abnormally low reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) concentrations. However, stage IV hospitalized patients had significantly lower TT3 values than stage IV ambulatory patients. In contrast to TBG, mean levels of CBG and SHBG were comparable in the three groups and within normal limits. For the whole population of HIV patients, there was a highly significant correlation between the CD4 lymphocyte count and TBG (r = -0.529, p less than 0.001) but not with CBG and SHBG levels. Finally, TNF values higher than 10 pg/mL were detected in six of the 17 stage IV patients and in only one of the 13 stage III patients (p = 0.059); elevated TNF levels correlated with a lower CD4 count (p less than 0.01) but not with serum TBG levels. CONCLUSION: The progression of HIV infection is associated with an elevation of serum TNF and TBG, but not of CBG or SHBG. HIV-infected patients have an unexpectedly normal TT3-low rT3 state.",Virus_Diseases
"Inherited mouse mutations as models of human adnexal, cornification, and papulosquamous dermatoses. Nearly 100 mouse mutations have been described as causing some type of abnormality of the skin or hair. As only a few of these mutations have been studied in detail, they remain an untapped resource for furthering knowledge of basic cutaneous physiology and understanding the pathophysiology of analogous diseases in humans. Several diverse murine mutations are discussed. These include ""asebia,"" a mildly hyperkeratotoic disorder with sebaceous gland hypoplasia; ""ichthyosis,"" an example of abnormal hair growth associated with hyperkeratosis; ""rhino"" and ""hairless,"" two related examples of congenital follicular malformations; and ""flaky skin"", a potential animal model of eruptive psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Upregulated expression and function of VLA-4 fibronectin receptors on human activated T cells in rheumatoid arthritis. The VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29) integrin is a cell surface receptor involved in the interaction of lymphoid cells with both extracellular matrix (ECM) and endothelial cells. We have investigated the expression and function of VLA-4 fibronectin (FN) receptors on T cells localized in the inflammed synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A high proportion of T cells in both synovial membrane (SM) and synovial fluid (SF) expressed the activation antigens AIM (CD69) and gp95/85 (Ea2) as well as an increased number of VLA-4 alpha and beta 1 adhesion molecules, as compared with peripheral blood (PB) T cells from the same patients. Furthermore, the majority of these activated SF T cells were able to adhere to a 38-kD FN proteolytic fragment containing the connecting segment-1 (CS-1) specifically through VLA-4 receptors, whereas a significantly lower proportion of PB T cells displayed this capacity. Therefore, our results show that activated T cells selectively localize at sites of tissue injury in RA disease and provide evidence for the in vivo regulation of the expression and function of the VLA-4 integrin. This regulatory mechanism may enable T cells either to facilitate migration or to persist at sites of inflammation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of rheumatoid arthritis--a comparison with plain film radiographs. Conventional radiography lacks sensitivity in early rheumatoid disease. MRI with its advantages of soft tissue discrimination and multiplanar imaging facility might detect earlier disease.

"Premature alveolar bone loss in Erdheim-Chester disease. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare histiocytosis also known as lipoid granulomatosis. Oral findings have not been reported previously to our knowledge. This case report documents evidence of oral sequelae of Erdheim-Chester disease. A patient whose course was followed for 10 years at the National Institutes of Health had premature alveolar bone resorption. He underwent full-mouth extraction at age 29 years because of severe periodontitis. Histopathologic evidence of Erdheim-Chester disease was demonstrated in the periodontal soft tissues. In the ensuring years, accelerated resorption of the residual ridges precluded the use of conventional dentures.

"Specific nucleotide sequence of HLA-C is strongly associated with psoriasis vulgaris. The association of specific HLA-C nucleotide sequences with psoriasis vulgaris was investigated in 75 Japanese patients by the polymerase chain reaction method, followed by slot-blot hybridization using two specific oligonucleotide probes. The synthesized nucleotide primers were C180P, 5'-GACCGGGAGACACAGAAGTACAAG-3' (coding for amino acid residues 61 to 68 of the alpha 1 domain of the HLA-C molecule) and C243PR, 5'-GCTCTGGTTGTAGTAGCCGCG-3' (residues 82 to 88), respectively. The amplified sequence detected with the probe C208A (5'-AGGCACAGGCTGACCGA-3'), including the coding region for alanine at position 73, was significantly increased in frequency in the patients compared with the healthy individuals (81% versus 48%, relative risk = 4.7, chi 2 = 15.3, p less than 0.0001). This specific nucleotide sequence is common to Cw6 and Cw7, but some other HLA-C alleles including Cw4 and C blank (Cx52) also proved to have this sequence. It is suggested that alanine at position 73 of HLA-C molecules can be a good marker for psoriasis vulgaris and that this residue may play an important role in determining susceptibility to this disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Idiopathic scrotal calcinosis is idiopathic. The appearance of calcific masses within the dermis of scrotal skin is generally referred to as idiopathic scrotal calcinosis. There has been some debate about the pathogenesis of these calcium deposits. This debate centers on the question of whether the calcium deposition is truly idiopathic or whether it occurs as a result of preexisting epidermal cysts. We have performed immunohistochemical staining for keratin in nine patients with apparent idiopathic scrotal calcinosis and have found no evidence of keratin in the dermal tissue immediately adjacent to the calcium deposits. We conclude that idiopathic scrotal calcinosis is idiopathic.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Oligoclonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements in blood lymphocytes of patients with acute Epstein-Barr virus-induced infectious mononucleosis. Gene rearrangement studies were performed on blood lymphocytes from eight patients with acute Epstein-Barr virus-induced infectious mononucleosis. The diagnosis in each case was based on characteristic clinical, hematologic, and serologic findings. The blood lymphocytes in each patient consisted predominantly of CD8+ T cells. EBV DNA was detected in seven patients by Southern blot analysis (EBV Bam HI W probe, Bam HI). A germline configuration was found for the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes (JH probe, Bam HI and Eco RI; C kappa probe, Bam HI; and C lambda probe, Eco RI). T cell receptor gene rearrangements were detected with J gamma and J beta 1 + 2 probes. Using a J gamma probe with two different restriction enzymes (Bgl II and Eco RI), the blood from each patient showed several bands corresponding to the polyclonal pattern previously described in the blood of normal individuals. Using J beta 1 + 2 probes with two different restriction enzymes (Bgl II and Bam HI), each case showed from 3 to about 12 extragermline bands of varying intensity and in different locations from case to case. In addition, each case showed relative deletion of the J beta 1 germline band. This oligoclonal pattern of T cell receptor gene rearrangements has not been previously reported in benign or malignant T cell populations.",Virus_Diseases
"Rabies. Human rabies is extremely rare and canine rabies is largely controlled in the United States. Wild animals are now responsible for most of the rabies prevention costs and postexposure treatments in the United States, either by direct exposure of humans or by exposure of domestic animals. Although the situation is similar in most other developed countries, canine rabies remains widespread and a substantial risk to persons traveling in developing countries, where millions of people are exposed and tens of thousands die of rabies each year. People living in the United States should be advised to avoid contact with wild animals and stray or ill-appearing domestic animals. Travelers to rabies enzootic countries can substantially reduce the risk of rabies exposures by avoiding all dogs as well as wild animals; those persons whose risk of exposure cannot be reduced should be educated about rabies and should receive preexposure vaccination.",Virus_Diseases
"Treatment of hirsutism by an association of oral cyproterone acetate and transdermal 17 beta-estradiol. Twenty-four hirsute women were treated with an inversal sequential scheme of cyproterone acetate, 50 mg/d by oral route from the 1st to the 15th day of the menstrual cycle, along with 100 micrograms/24 h of 17 beta-estradiol transdermally administered from days 1 to 21, for nine cycles at weekly intervals. The acne and seborrhea as well as hirsutism showed a significant improvement in all subjects studied. The plasma testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decrease from 1.5 +/- 1.3 ng/mL and 6.9 +/- 1.3 micrograms/mL to 0.5 +/- 0.03 ng/mL and 2.7 +/- 1.7 micrograms/mL, respectively. Similar values were observed in subjects with idiopathic hirsutism during the treatment. The metabolic parameters, as well as the plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, appeared unaffected by the therapy. Furthermore, the luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone secretion was strongly inhibited from the first cycle of treatment. In conclusion, considering the good clinical results and the avoidance of any hepatic effect, this association should be taken into account in the treatment of hirsutism, especially in case of oral estrogen intolerance.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Influence of methotrexate and azathioprine on radiologic progression in rheumatoid arthritis. A randomized, double-blind study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of azathioprine and methotrexate on progression of radiologic damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized 48-week trial. PATIENTS: Sixty-four patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who either have not responded to or who have reacted with side effects to at least parenteral gold and D-penicillamine. INTERVENTIONS: Either azathioprine, 100 mg daily, or methotrexate, 7.5 mg weekly, was administered orally. Depending on the clinical effect after 8 weeks, the dosage was increased to either azathioprine, 150 mg, or methotrexate, 15 mg. The dosages for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prednisone were held stable. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory assessments were done by the same physician every 4 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet obtained at baseline and after 24 and 48 weeks were scored by one rheumatologist blinded to medication and clinical findings. MAIN RESULTS: Initial radiologic scores were comparable in both groups and correlated with disease duration (r = 0.38). An intention-to-treat analysis after 24 and 48 weeks showed significantly fewer new erosions in the methotrexate group compared with the azathioprine group (difference, 2.0 [95% CI, 0.2 to 3.9] and 3.5 [CI, 1.3 to 5.8], respectively). The change in total joint score was also significantly less pronounced in the methotrexate group compared with the azathioprine group after 24 weeks (difference, 2.8 [CI, 0.2 to 5.2]) and after 48 weeks (difference, 3.9 [CI, 0.3 to 7.4]). Radiologic stabilization after 48 weeks was present in 10% of the azathioprine group compared with 29% of the methotrexate group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with low-dose methotrexate showed significantly less radiologic progression than patients treated with azathioprine. This result suggests that methotrexate therapy is clinically superior in these patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Sweet's syndrome: a clinicopathologic review of twenty-nine cases. Twenty-nine patients with Sweet's syndrome were studied. Not all of Sweet's original criteria were necessarily present and diagnosis was dependent on the recognition of the typical, acute, tender, erythematous plaques and the characteristic histologic features of a neutrophilic infiltrate with leukocytoclasis. Women are affected much more frequently than men. The origin of Sweet's syndrome is still unclear, but an underlying disease was found in more than 50% of our cases. A streptococcal infection was evident in six cases, inflammatory bowel disease in three cases, malignancy in four cases, and pregnancy in two others. Treatment with oral prednisolone for an average of 6 weeks was the usual treatment, although in four patients the disease cleared spontaneously. Resolution of the eruption is occasionally followed by milia and scarring. Recurrences are common and affect up to one third of patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Granuloma annulare, sarcoidal and other granulomatous dermatitides, pseudolymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma have been described as sequelae of herpes zoster. We report a new postzoster reaction, granulomatous vasculitis, that caused flat-topped papules restricted to the affected dermatome. Polymerase chain reaction failed to detect varicella-zoster virus in a biopsy specimen. These results suggest that granulomatous vasculitis occurs without persistence of the viral genome and, perhaps, is a reaction to minute amounts of viral proteins.",Virus_Diseases
"Management of onychomycosis with oral terbinafine.

"Methotrexate versus azathioprine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A forty-eight-week randomized, double-blind trial. We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial comparing azathioprine (AZA) and methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in whom parenteral gold and/or D-penicillamine treatment had been unsuccessful. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either AZA (100 mg daily) or oral MTX (7.5 mg weekly). After 8 weeks, the dosage was increased depending on the clinical improvement. Sixty-four patients were followed up for 48 weeks (33 AZA, 31 MTX). Comparison of values at week 24 with baseline values revealed significant improvement in 12 of 13 disease variables in the MTX group and in 6 of 13 in the AZA group. Comparison between the 2 treatment groups at 24 weeks, by area-under-the-curve analysis, showed significantly more improvement in the MTX group in terms of the swollen joint count, pain score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, hemoglobin level, thrombocyte level, and disease activity score. A significant overall clinical improvement (disease activity score) was found in 7 of 20 patients treated with AZA and 18 of 30 patients treated with MTX after 24 weeks of therapy, and in 6 of 12 AZA-treated patients and 19 of 25 MTX-treated patients after 48 weeks. The number of withdrawals due to side effects was significantly higher in the AZA group. After 48 weeks, only 12 patients from the AZA group (36%), but 25 from the MTX group (81%), were still using the initial drug. These results demonstrate MTX to be superior to AZA in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, with a more rapid clinical improvement which is sustained after 1 year, accompanied by a lower rate of serious adverse reactions.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Pneumocystis carinii: a deadly opportunist. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is a life-threatening complication of diseases and therapies associated with immunosuppression. Approximately 80 percent of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome will develop pneumocystis pneumonia. Diagnosis is important, because effective therapy is available. In most cases, diagnosis can be made by sputum analysis. Bronchoalveolar lavage will yield a diagnosis in 85 to 90 percent of patients with pneumocystis pneumonia, and is used when sputum induction and analysis is unproductive, unavailable or negative. Transbronchial biopsy and, rarely, open lung biopsy will yield the etiology of pneumonia in the remaining patients. Pentamidine or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the treatment of choice. Toxicity often occurs, including hypoglycemia, nephrotoxicity, neutropenia and rash. Corticosteroids are helpful in moderate to severe disease. Mortality for the first episode of P. carinii pneumonia averages 20 percent. Prophylaxis effectively prevents and reduces the incidence of future episodes.",Virus_Diseases
"Surgical management of primary hyperhidrosis. Primary hyperhidrosis, although lacking a precise definition and of unknown aetiology, disrupts professional and social life and may lead to emotional problems. A variety of treatment methods are used to control or reduce the profuse sweating which involves mainly the palms, soles and axillae. The simplest method, the application of topical agents, is usually attempted first for axillary and plantar sweating. Iontophoresis may provide relief especially in patients with plantar or palmar involvement. In severe cases operative intervention is necessary. Excision of sweat glands is successful in patients with axillary hyperhidrosis but the role of suction-assisted removal of axillary sweat glands remains to be determined. Sympathectomy remains the standard by which other treatments must be judged. For upper thoracic sympathectomy a variety of surgical approaches are used with satisfactory relief of hyperhidrosis. Complications related to the surgical approach, such as Horner's syndrome, brachial plexus injuries, pneumothorax and painful scars may occur, while following sympathectomy compensatory hyperhidrosis is usual and hyperhidrosis may recur. Plantar hyperhidrosis which may be exacerbated or ameliorated by upper thoracic sympathectomy and which fails to respond to non-operative intervention is relieved by lumbar sympathectomy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The effect of diaper type and overclothing on fecal contamination in day-care centers [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Jun 5;265(21):2810] Fecal coliform contamination of environmental surfaces and hands in the day-care center is common. This study evaluated the effect of two diaper types on fecal contamination. Ten rooms in four day-care centers containing 141 children were studied in a prospective, randomized, crossover study. A total of 2946 samples were cultured during the 9-week study. Fecal coliforms were isolated from 307 inanimate objects (15%), 73 toy balls (46%), and 131 hands (17%). The number of contaminated inanimate objects was significantly less in rooms where paper diapers were worn when compared with that in rooms where double cloth diapers with plastic overpants were worn and in rooms where clothes were worn over diapers. Inanimate object cultures had more contamination in rooms in which diarrhea had occurred. Containment of feces by overclothes and diaper type may be important in decreasing transmission of enteric pathogens in day-care environments.",Virus_Diseases
"Cytomegalovirus esophagitis in AIDS: diagnosis by endoscopic biopsy. We have reviewed 28 esophageal biopsies from 28 patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), over a 1-yr period. Indications for esophageal biopsy were dysphagia persisting after antifungal therapy and/or radiologic evidence of esophageal ulcer. We compared the frequency of detecting cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain with immunoperoxidase staining for CMV antigens. Five biopsies were positive for CMV by H&E stain and immunoperoxidase. Infected cells could often be identified in the granulation tissue and, in one severe case, in stromal papillae of the intact mucosa. Squamous cells were never positive. Thirteen biopsies consisted only of squamous epithelium, and all of these were negative by both techniques. Among the remaining 10 cases, no CMV inclusions were identified by H&E. Three of these biopsies displayed staining for viral antigens. In all cases positive by immunoperoxidase, numerous cells positive for viral antigens did not display any of the CMV-specific morphologic diagnostic criteria. Other coexisting diagnoses included candidiasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and malignant lymphoma. We conclude 1) CMV infection of the esophagus is common in AIDS patients with esophageal ulcer or esophagitis resistant to antifungal therapy; 2) multiple infections or neoplasms may coexist; 3) since CMV apparently does not infect squamous epithelium and only rarely endothelium in stromal papillae, deep biopsies are necessary for diagnosis; and 4) immunoperoxidase staining is required for maximum diagnostic yield.",Virus_Diseases
"A semiquantitative microassay for measurement of relative number of blood mononuclear cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus. A simple semiquantitative microassay was developed for the measurement of relative number of infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The assay is based on cocultivation of serially diluted PBMC of a seropositive person with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal PBMC. The microassay has comparable sensitivity with the standard virus culture method in detecting positive HIV cultures. Since the microassay uses only 2-3 x 10(5) patients' PBMC, the assay is also most suitable for HIV isolation from HIV-infected infants or from AIDS patients with extremely low T-cell counts. The microassay can also be used to measure antiviral effects of a drug on persistent HIV infection in vitro. Because the microassay measures the relative number of infected PBMC, it can be readily used for following the quantitative antiviral effect of a drug in a clinical trial.",Virus_Diseases

Influenza is an important cause of serious illness in very young children with cardiopulmonary disease. A 4-year study was conducted at two centers to assess immunogenicity and safety of influenza split-product vaccine in children aged 3 to 18 months with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease. A total of 113 children were studied: 62 children 3 to 5 months of age and 51 children 6 to 18 months of age. Sera were drawn prior to first and second immunization and 3 weeks after second immunization and were tested by hemagglutination inhibition; protection was defined as greater than 1:32. Ninety-five children were surveyed for adverse reactions. Seroresponses were age and antigen specific. Best responses for all ages were to A/Mississippi (H3N2) (97%). Children older than 6 months of age had better seroresponses to A/Leningrad (H3N2) (73%, P less than .03) and B/Victoria (62%, P less than .02) than did children younger than 6 months of age. Seroconversion rates to the remaining antigens were low. Only 9% of children experienced adverse reactions; all but one were mild.

"Experience with the functional cleft lip repair. The first 12 functional cleft lip repairs performed on unselected consecutive patients immediately following the completion of training by the author are presented. Previous reports on this cleft lip repair have shown excellent results but have always been based on patients operated on by the originator of the procedure. This report gives credence to the ease with which a cleft lip repair that gives reproducible good results can be taught and learned even by plastic surgeons with limited experience. It reviews the technical steps of the procedure, which emphasizes wide undermining and release of the orbicularis oris muscle on the lateral side of the cleft to allow redraping and lengthening of the lip skin, step-by-step layered closure of the mucosa, muscle, and skin, and further vertical lengthening of the lip with a Z-plasty skin closure. Three elements that are difficult to achieve or restore with cleft lip revision are evaluated: (1) achievement of a good skin scar, (2) maintenance of the alar-facial groove, and (3) achievement of adequate lip height without sacrificing horizontal lip length. Ten of the 12 patients had a satisfactory scar, 9 patients had a good alar-facial groove, and all patients had a normal-appearing horizontal lip length. Nine patients required secondary surgery; however, in six patients, this included correction of the nasal deformity that was not corrected at the time of cleft lip repair.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"HMB-45 immunohistochemical staining of conjunctival melanocytic lesions. HMB-45 is a monoclonal antibody recently described as being highly specific for melanocytic proliferations of the skin and in metastases of melanotic lesions. To determine a possible role for HMB-45 in ophthalmic pathology, 45 conjunctival lesions, including 23 melanomas, were analyzed using immunohistochemical techniques with anti-S-100 and HMB-45 as primary antibodies. Nineteen (82.6%) of the melanomas exhibited HMB-45 positivity, and 19 (82.6%) contained S-100 protein, with concordance of all but two cases. Seven cases of primary acquired melanosis were studied; one (33%) of three with atypia was HMB-45 positive, as were two (50%) of four without atypia. Among nevi, 1 (9.1%) of 11 showed faint staining with HMB-45. Fifteen conjunctival epithelial dysplasias were negative with HMB-45. At present, HMB-45 appears to offer no great advantage over S-100 protein in the analysis of conjunctival melanomas.

"Intravenous heme-albumin in acute intermittent porphyria: evidence for repletion of hepatic hemoproteins and regulatory heme pools. The purpose of this study was to assess effects of heme administered intravenously, complexed to human serum albumin, on activities of the hepatic hemoproteins, cytochrome(s) P-450, and tryptophan pyrrolase, and on the size of the heme pool that regulates activity of 5-aminolevulinate synthase. Effects were compared in six normal women and four women with acute intermittent porphyria. All porphyric subjects over-excreted heme precursors and had histories of acute neurovisceral porphyric attacks. All subjects were placed on a constant daily diet that included at least 3 g carbohydrate/kg body weight and sufficient total intake to provide 1.4 times the estimated resting energy expenditure. Urinary excretions of 5-aminolevulinate, porphobilinogen, porphyrins, and metabolites of tryptophan were measured daily before, during, and after infusions of heme-albumin. In the porphyric subjects, intravenous heme [4 mg (6.1 mumol)/kg body weight (BWt) with equimolar albumin], given daily for 4 days, markedly reduced overexcretion of 5-aminolevulinate, porphobilinogen, and porphyrins, indicating repletion of the regulatory heme pool. The heme infusions also decreased mean urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid from 4.9 to 2.9 mg/g creatinine per day, suggesting increased activity of hepatic tryptophan pyrrolase, the rate-controlling enzyme for metabolism of tryptophan to products not in the serotonin-5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid pathway. Heme-albumin infusions were without detectable effects on excretions of heme precursors or tryptophan metabolites in normal subjects. In contrast, in both normals and porphyrics, heme-albumin infusions significantly increased rates of antipyrine metabolism (by 159% and 330%, respectively), suggesting increased activities of cytochrome(s) P-450 were produced by the infusions. The infusions were well tolerated; no subject developed thrombophlebitis or bleeding. We conclude that such infusions are safe and effective in repleting deficient heme pools and hemoproteins in patients with acute porphyria, and that activities of cytochrome(s) P-450 in normal subjects may also be increased by heme administration. The therapeutic effect of heme in acute porphyria probably relates to its ability to decrease overproduction of precursors of heme or serotonin, as the result of its increasing critical cellular heme pools.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evolution of the placental barrier to fetal infection by murine enteroviruses. A murine model that demonstrated a placental barrier to fetal enterovirus infection in late pregnancy was extended to middle and early gestation. Inoculation with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) in middle and early gestation infected 73% and 90% of placentas and 7% and 78% of fetuses, respectively. In situ hybridization (ISH) of tissues obtained after middle-gestation inoculation revealed TMEV in the placental decidua and spongiotrophoblast layers but generally not in the labyrinth (the layer adjacent to the fetus) or fetus (similar to late gestation). In contrast, ISH of placentas harvested after early-gestation inoculation identified TMEV predominantly in the labyrinth, in which vasculature was often replaced by hyalinized hemorrhagic tissue and small cell infiltrates; fetuses contained virus in heart, pericardium, great vessels, lung, pleura, brain, and liver. The placental barrier to enterovirus transmission appears to develop between early and middle gestation. Enterovirus infection before this time may induce placental damage, fetal infection, or both.",Virus_Diseases

Most reported mutations have been single base substitutions. We now report three different frameshift mutations in three unrelated individuals with type IA OCA. The first individual has a single base deletion within a series of five guanidines, resulting in a premature stop codon in exon I on one allele and a missense mutation at codon 382 in exon III on the homologous allele. The second individual is a genetic compound of two separate frameshift mutations, including both the same exon I single base deletion found in the first individual and a deletion of a thymidine-guanidine pair, within the sequence GTGTG, forming a termination codon (TAG) in exon I on the homologous allele. The third individual has a single base insertion in exon I on one allele and a missense mutation at codon 373 in exon III on the homologous allele. The two missense mutations occur within the copper Bbinding region and may interfere with either copper binding to the enzyme or oxygen binding to the copper. These five different mutations disrupt tyrosinase function and are associated with a total lack of melanin biosynthesis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A comparison of changes in the transcutaneous oxygen tension and capillary blood flow in the skin with increasing compressive weights. Two measures are being advocated to evaluate physiologic changes associated with compression of skin: transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcO2) and laser-Doppler blood flow. This study asked: 1) What changes occur in tcO2 and laser-Doppler blood flow with increasing compressive weight; and 2) do these measures respond differently to increasing weight? An indenter was used to apply incremental weight to the trochanter of healthy volunteers. During the first session, tcO2 was measured, and laser-Doppler blood flow was measured during the second session. The mean values of tcO2 and laser-Doppler blood flow were analyzed for significant changes over the range of applied weight. If significant change occurred, the polynomial that best described the data was determined. Mean values for tcO2 showed a significant decrease with increasing compressive weight. Its decrease was described by a second degree polynomial (quadratic). The weight that resulted in the tcO2 reaching zero for individual subjects ranged from 400-1000. Mean values for laser-Doppler blood flow showed a significant decrease with increased weight. The decrease was best described by a first degree polynomial (line), which is a different pattern from the tcO2. Laser-Doppler blood flow continued to decline with increasing weight beyond the point where tcO2 reached zero. During low-flow states, tissue oxygen utilization may exceed oxygen delivery and lead to ischemia even though capillary closure has not occurred.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Twelve cases of Ki-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma of skin. In seven of 12 cases of Ber-H2 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Ki-1 ALCL) disease remained localised to skin, and in five there was extracutaneous spread. Four patients had histological evidence of pre-existing or coexisting mycosis fungoides, and three patients had a long standing history of eczema or ichthyosis. In two cases the presence of a T phenotype was shown in frozen sections, and in a further six cases a T phenotype was firmly established in paraffin wax sections. Four patients died less than one year after presentation (two with disseminated lymphoma; two from other causes); one died at five years with widespread lymphoma and the remaining seven cases were alive one to 14 1/2 years after presentation. Three of the four patients with associated mycosis fungoides had prolonged survival, contrary to the findings of previous reports which suggest secondary Ki-1 ALCL behaves aggressively. The recognition of these tumours is important because of their relatively good prognosis. The diagnosis can be readily substantiated immunohistochemically, using a simple panel of antibodies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Contact allergy due to colophony (VII). Sensitizing studies with oxidation products of abietic and related acids. 9 oxidation products of abietic acid, dehydroabietic acid, and levopimaric acid were prepared synthetically to determine their sensitizing potential in guinea pigs. It was found that compounds with epoxy and peroxo groups in rings A and B had a notable sensitizing potential. The same result was found with 7-oxode-hydroabietic acid identified earlier in rosin (3) and a polar fraction obtained from commercial abietic acid, suggesting the presence of still unidentified oxidation products. Hydroxylation of rings A or B, or conversion to the methyl esters, considerably decreases the sensitizing potential. A model is presented underlining the importance of hydrophobic and polar domains, in addition to chemically reactive groupings, in the allergen. Insertion into the lipid bilayer may play an important role in contact sensitivity.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hepatitis C quantification and sequencing in blood products, haemophiliacs, and drug users. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected specific hepatitis C viral (HCV) RNA sequences in plasma from 15 of 21 haemophiliacs (12 HCV-antibody positive) and 7 of 27 intravenous drug users (13 HCV-antibody positive). Quantification of RNA-positive samples showed high levels of HCV (10(5) to 10(6) copies of RNA/ml) in infected patients. HCV was more frequently found in haemophiliacs infected with human immunodeficiency virus (11/11 HIV-positive and 4/10 HIV-negative patients). HCV-RNA was detected in all batches of commercially available factor VIII tested and in low concentrations in some pools of plasma donations from volunteers. Factor VIII, manufactured from volunteer donations, was uniformly negative by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences showed two distinct groups: one was associated with intravenous drug users and the other with haemophiliacs infected with Scottish factor VIII preparations. Both were distinct from sequences found in commercially available factor VIII.",Virus_Diseases
"C5a, cutaneous mast cells, and inflammation: in vitro and in vivo studies in a murine model. To evaluate further the interactions of C5a and mast cells in cutaneous inflammation, the ability of human native C5a (nC5a) (10 to 500 ng/ml) and human recombinant C5a (rC5a) (10 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml) to induce histamine release from purified BALB/c cutaneous mast cells (CMC) and peritoneal mast cells (PMC) was analyzed. It was found that nC5a induced histamine release from CMC but not from PMC, with a maximal net release at 250 ng/ml nC5a (22.8 +/- 2.6%). Kinetic experiments demonstrated that nC5a-induced maximal net histamine release occurred 5 min after the presentation of this stimulus (25.8 +/- 6.0%). Using rC5a and CMC, dose-response studies indicated a maximal net release of 7.0 +/- 1.7% at rC5a of 10 ng/ml, and kinetic studies showed a maximal net release at 5 min of incubation (12.9 +/- 1.6%). Release induced by rC5a was calcium-dependent, and peaked at 30 degrees C. These results indicate that functional heterogeneity exists between the CMC and the PMC of BALB/c mice, that C5a is a relevant stimulus for characterization of this heterogeneity, and that CMC from these animals can serve as a convenient in vitro model for the study of human C5a-mast cell interactions. In vivo, injections of nC5a (25-100 ng) and rC5a (25-100 ng) into the skin of BALB/c mice induced an increase in cutaneous vasopermeability, as assessed by the extravasation of intravenously injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. nC5a induced a dose-dependent increase in vasopermeability, whereas alterations induced by rC5a plateaued at 50 ng. The C5a-induced vasopermeability was markedly enhanced in animals that had been previously treated with an inhibitor of serum carboxypeptidase, which converts C5a to the less potent derivative, C5a des Arg. These findings suggest that carboxypeptidase plays an important role in vivo in the modulation of C5a-induced cutaneous inflammation in murine skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Establishment in culture and characterization of a strain with mast cell and monocytic properties from the bone marrow of a child with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. Bone marrow was isolated from a child with congenital mastocytosis. Upon prolonged in vitro culture, initially in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3), a population of relatively large fusiform, strongly adherent cells grew out plus a subpopulation of smaller nonadherent cells. The morphology of the adherent cells was not typical of fibroblasts, epithelial cells, nor of standard hematopoietic cell types, whereas the morphology of the nonadherent cells resembled mast cells. Neither cell type required the presence of IL-3 nor a feeder layer of fibroblasts for continued growth. Attempts to isolate the two populations were unsuccessful. This cell strain comprised of both cell populations has been termed human bone marrow-derived mastocytosis cells (HBM-M). These cells were found to possess some of the cytochemical, ultrastructural, and surface phenotypic features of degranulated mast cells. They reacted with the mast cell marker, monoclonal antibody YB5.B8, but not with the basophil specific monoclonal antibody Bsp-1 and released the inflammatory mediators histamine, leukotriene C4, prostaglandin D2, and platelet-activating factor constitutively. This release was not potentiated by immunologic- or nonimmunologic-activating stimuli. In addition, they exhibited cytochemical and surface phenotypic features of monocytes. Our results indicate that a population of abnormal proliferative cells exist in the marrow of this patient; that these cells may be responsible for the patient's pronounced systemic proliferation of mast cells and the associated symptoms; and that the cell's mast cell, monocyte properties may be indicative of a common bone marrow-derived mast cell/monocyte precursor.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Abnormal cutaneous topobiology: the molecular basis for dermatopathologic mononuclear cell patterns in inflammatory skin disease. Because of the identification and characterization of various adhesion molecules (lymphocyte function associated antigen-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1), chemotactic factors (interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic/activating factor), and their modulatory cytokines (gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor), it is possible to begin to ascribe specific molecules to cutaneous cellular reaction patterns. The abnormal topobiology, or altered spatial distribution, of mononuclear cells, which gives rise to disease-specific patterns, was described in molecular terms. A large number of diverse skin diseases were classified into six different groups, with each group highlighting distinctive cell types, adhesion molecules, chemotactic factors, and cytokines. The diseases within each group, which share functional anatomical reaction zones, were postulated to share common pathophysiologic pathways. Thus, it is now possible, as one scans the microscopic field, to look past the static images of red- and blue-stained cells and appreciate a dynamic and detailed medley of molecularly defined events emanating from the eyepiece.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A common Lithuanian mutation causing familial hypercholesterolemia in Ashkenazi Jews. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. Here we characterize an LDL-receptor founder mutation that is associated with a distinct LDL-receptor haplotype and is responsible for FH in 35% of 71 Jewish-Ashkenazi FH families in Israel. Sixty four percent (16/25) of the Ashkenazi patients who carry this mutant allele were of Lithuanian origin. The mutation was not found in 47 non-Ashkenazi FH families. This mutation was prevalent (8/10 FH cases) in the Jewish community in South Africa, which originated mainly from Lithuania. The mutation, a 3-bp in-frame deletion that would result in the elimination of Gly197, has been previously designated FH-Piscataway. PCR amplification of a DNA fragment that includes the mutation in heterozygous individuals results in the formation of a heteroduplex that can be demonstrated by PAGE and used for molecular diagnosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Interleukin-6 activity in paired samples of synovial fluid. Correlation of synovial fluid interleukin-6 levels with clinical and laboratory parameters of inflammation. Paired synovial fluid (SF) samples obtained from the knees of 12 arthritis patients were studied to establish a relation between parameters of local inflammatory activity and SF interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Local disease activity was scored using joint temperature, swelling and pain as clinical parameters of inflammation. SF samples were assayed for laboratory parameters of inflammation such as leucocyte content, the percentage polymorphonuclear cells, the pH, and for immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM). SF IL-6 concentrations were determined using the B9-bioassay. Within individual patients the local activity of inflammation as measured using clinical parameters was found to be related to the local SF IL-6 level. When considering the total group of patients, a correlation (P less than 0.001) was found between the clinical parameters of local inflammation and the SF IL-6 levels. Furthermore, IL-6 levels were found to correlate with leucocyte counts (P less than 0.02), the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (P less than 0.10), the pH value (P less than 0.01), but not with SF IgM and IgG concentrations.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A double-blind gastroscopic evaluation of the effects of etodolac and naproxen on the gastrointestinal mucosa of rheumatic patients. The aim of this clinical, endoscopical study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and the gastric tolerability of etodolac, a new anti-inflammatory, non-steroidal drug, compared with naproxen. The study was conducted on 48 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. 44 of whom completed the trial. After an initial oesophagogastroduodenoscopy to exclude the presence of gastric mucosal lesions, patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with either etodolac 200 mg b.i.d. or naproxen 500 mg b.i.d. for a period of 4 weeks. Endoscopic control followed this treatment period. Both drugs proved effective in relieving clinical symptoms, without a statistically significant difference. Gastric mucosal lesions were observed in 15% of etodolac-treated patients and in 46% of patients treated with naproxen (P less than 0.05) (95% CI 0.01-0.60). Painful dyspepsia was observed in 15% of patients treated with etodolac vs. 38% of patients on naproxen therapy. This study demonstrates that etodolac is at least as active as naproxen in relieving rheumatic symptoms, and its administration results in a significantly lower degree of gastric damage.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hepatitis B and C viruses and their interaction in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum taken from patients in a case-control study in Athens, Greece, was used to examine the interactive roles of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV was used to test serum taken from 185 cases with HCC, 35 cases with metastatic liver cancer (MLC), and 432 hospital controls. Weakly positive anti-HCV results were more strongly related to MLC than to HCC, implying that these anti-HCV results are false positive. By contrast, strongly positive anti-HCV results were significantly related to HCC (relative risk [RR], 6.3), whereas no significant association was evident for MLC (RR, 0.6). The association of anti-HCV with HCC was substantially higher among subjects whose radioimmunoassay was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (RR, 20.0) than among those whose radioimmunoassay was negative for this marker (RR, 4.8). These findings indicate that HCV infection has an interactive role in the origin of HCC.",Virus_Diseases

"Acquired immune dysfunction in cats with experimentally induced feline immunodeficiency virus infection: comparison of short-term and long-term infections. Specific pathogen-free domestic cats with experimentally induced feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infections of short duration (less than or equal to 10 months) exhibited depressed total leukocyte and neutrophil numbers and a marginally decreased lymphocyte proliferative response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM), while cats with infections of more lengthy duration (greater than or equal to 25 months) exhibited normal leukocyte and neutrophil numbers but a dramatic loss of responsiveness to both PWM and concanavalin A (Con A). Cats with short-term infections exhibited a decrease in the percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood and a corresponding depression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio. Cats with long-term infections exhibited a similar but more profound perturbation of the CD4+ lymphocyte subset that also included a decrease in the absolute number of CD4+ cells. The decreased responsiveness to Con A and PWM in cats infected long term paralleled the decline in CD4+ cell counts, and the duration of infection was directly correlated with the decrease in the percentage of CD4+ cells. These data provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that FIV is the cause of an immune dysfunction in cats, with distinct similarities to that produced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in people.",Virus_Diseases
"Cyclosporine for plaque-type psoriasis. Results of a multidose, double-blind trial  BACKGROUND. Severe plaque-type psoriasis has been successfully treated with orally administered cyclosporine, but there has been no comparative, controlled evaluation of various dosages and their efficacy and side effects. METHODS. In a 16-week, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 85 patients with severe psoriasis to receive 3, 5, or 7.5 mg of cyclosporine per kilogram of body weight per day or a placebo consisting of the vehicle for the drug. After eight weeks the dose could be adjusted to improve safety or efficacy while maintaining blinding. RESULTS. The psoriasis improved in a dose-dependent fashion. After eight weeks of fixed-dose therapy, 36, 65, and 80 percent of the patients receiving 3, 5, and 7.5 mg of cyclosporine per kilogram per day, respectively, were rated as being clear or almost clear of psoriasis; each group had significant improvement (P less than 0.0001) as compared with the group receiving vehicle, in which none of the patients were rated as clear or almost clear. The patients who received 5 mg per kilogram were the least likely to require dosage adjustments because of side effects or a lack of efficacy. The glomerular filtration rate, measured in a subgroup of 34 patients receiving cyclosporine, decreased by a median of 16 percent. Higher doses of cyclosporine had greater adverse effects on systolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and serum levels of creatinine, uric acid, bilirubin, and cholesterol. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to skin-test antigens were reduced by cyclosporine administration. Cyclosporine appears to become concentrated in skin. CONCLUSIONS. Cyclosporine therapy leads to a rapid and thorough clearing of psoriasis; an initial dose of 5 mg per kilogram per day seems to be appropriate. However, the safety of cyclosporine for the long-term treatment of psoriasis remains to be determined.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Silent infections with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 are highly unlikely in multitransfused seronegative hemophiliacs. We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the frequency of silent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections in seronegative high-risk individuals with hemophilia who had been exposed to contaminated blood products more than 3 years previously. In a cross-sectional study of a cohort of 57 prospectively followed seronegative hemophiliacs who received multiple transfusions before 1986, HIV-1 proviral DNA was found transiently in only one patient. These data suggest that the rate of HIV infection among high-risk antibody negative individuals with hemophilia is very low to absent, in the range of 0% to 2%. These findings should provide considerable reassurance to seronegative persons with hemophilia and their sexual partners.",Virus_Diseases

Their mean age at the final enterectomy was 40 yr. Adaptation to foodstuffs and the effects of physiologic alterations and complicating diseases on their return to work were emphasized. More than 3.5 yr after surgery, the patients had adapted to many kinds of foodstuffs, but dietary fat could not be tolerated by three patients. Six patients returned to work an average of 2.7 yr after surgery, but four were obliged to discontinue their work because of rehospitalization for long-term complications.

"Interactions of epidermal cells and T cells in inflammatory skin diseases. Multiple cell types and their factors and cytokines are involved in regulating the immune response in inflammatory skin diseases. Stimulatory and inhibitory factors interact to determine whether the immune response is regulated up or down. Normally, stimulatory signals are counteracted by inhibitory signals to prevent an immune reaction from being initiated. However, exogenous antigens and irritants or endogenous factors and altered immunogenic self-peptides can upset this balance. When that occurs, T cells are activated and an inflammatory skin reaction develops. Lymphokines released from such activated T cells can modify the phenotype and function of normal keratinocytes. They can induce the expression of adhesion molecules and receptors involved in antigen presentation. Furthermore, they can also stimulate keratinocyte proliferation. This may be important in development of the hyperplasia seen in inflammatory skin diseases, especially in psoriasis. Cytokines released from the activated keratinocytes can both stimulate and attract T cells to the epidermis and thereby continue the ongoing immune reaction.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hair anatomy for the clinician. The rational evaluation of hair disorders requires familiarity with follicular anatomy. Hair structure can be easily examined by studying clipped hair shafts, entire hairs gently pulled or forcibly plucked from the scalp, and scalp biopsies (sectioned vertically or transversely). Anatomic features will be different depending on whether a given hair is in the anagen, catagen, or telogen phase. Follicle size will also vary, from the minute vellus hair to the long, thick terminal hair. Each follicle can be divided into distinct regions--bulb, suprabulbar zone, isthmus, and infundibulum. Activity growing (anagen) hairs are characterized by a hair matrix surrounding a dermal papilla; inner and outer root sheaths are present and well developed. A catagen hair can be identified by its markedly thickened vitreous layer and fibrous root sheath, which surrounds an epithelial column; above this column, the presumptive club forms. A telogen hair is distinguished by its fully keratinized club, which is surrounded by an epithelial sac. Below this lies the secondary hair germ and condensed dermal papilla, waiting for the mysterious signal that initiates a new life cycle.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastropathy: incidence and risk factor models  PURPOSE: The most prevalent serious drug toxicity in the United States is increasingly recognized as gastrointestinal (GI) pathology associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The incidence of serious GI events (hospitalization or death) associated with NSAID use was therefore prospectively analyzed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with osteoarthritis. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: The study consisted of 2,747 patients with RA and 1,091 patients with osteoarthritis. The yearly hospitalization incidence during NSAID treatment was 1.58% in RA patients and was similar in all five populations studied. The hazard ratio of patients taking NSAIDs to those not taking NSAIDs was 5.2. The incidence in osteoarthritis may be less. The risk of GI-related death in RA patients was 0.19% per year with NSAIDs. Multivariate analyses assessing risk factors for serious GI events were performed in the 1,694 (98 with an event) RA patients taking NSAIDs at the predictive visit. The main risk factors were higher age, use of prednisone, previous NSAID GI side effects, prior GI hospitalization, level of disability, and NSAID dose. A rule is presented that allows estimation of the risk for the individual patient with RA. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the risk factors for NSAID-associated gastropathy and their inter-relationships provides a tool for identification of the patient at high risk and for initiation of appropriate therapeutic action.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Production of site-selected neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against the third variable domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein. Cell lines secreting IgG1 human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the envelope glycoprotein, gp120, of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been produced by transformation of peripheral blood cells from HIV-infected individuals and by fusion of transformed cells to a human-mouse heteromyeloma cell line (SHM-D33). Two human mAbs were site-selected by means of a 23-mer synthetic peptide spanning a portion of the third variable domain of gp120 from the MN strain of HIV. The two heterohybridomas produce three times more IgG than do their parent lymphoblastoid cell lines. The specificities of these mAbs have been mapped to sequences near the tip of the disulfide loop of the gp120 third variable domain, Lys-Arg-Ile-His-Ile and His-Ile-Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg, respectively.

"Southern analysis of the 230-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen gene in normal humans, animals, and patients with junctional epidermolysis bullosa. To begin to characterize the 230-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPA) gene, we performed Southern analysis on genomic DNA with probes derived from 7 kb of cDNA that spans most of the coding region of this hemidesmosomal plaque protein. When hybridized to a 1-kb fragment of this BPA cDNA, normal human genomic DNA digested with EcoRI, BamHI, PstI, HindIII, or EcoRV showed only a single band, which was unique for each enzyme, indicating a single human gene for BPA. To determine if a related gene exists in animals, we used probes covering the full 7 kb of cDNA for Southern analysis of genomic DNA from various vertebrates. A related gene was detected in other mammals (monkey, cow, dog, rabbit, mouse, and rat) but not in chicken, frog, or fish. Under these same hybridization conditions a probe for human beta-actin could detect an actin gene in all these species. Furthermore, immunofluorescence showed that an antibody raised against portions of the 230-kD BPA bound to the epidermal basement membrane of mammals but not that of a bird or amphibian. Finally, because most patients with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) have defective hemidesmosomes in ultrastructure, and probably function, we analyzed genomic DNA from these patients. No restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) were detected when the DNA from 11 normals and 8 JEB patients (representing 16 possible defective genes) was digested with BamHI, EcoRI, or PstI and hybridized to any part of the cDNA. These findings indicate that 1) there is a single BPA gene in humans; 2) a closely related gene exists in other mammals but not birds, amphibia, or fish; and 3) gross abnormalities of the BPA gene are not characteristic of JEB patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Long-term enteral feeding of aged demented nursing home patients  The terminal phase of dementia is initiated by the inability to swallow. New techniques of enteral alimentation permit more effective, longer intubation. To assess the application of these new techniques to late-stage demented aged patients, all current intubations in a teaching nursing home were reviewed. Of 52 feeding intubations, 26 had been in situ for more than 1 year. A randomly selected comparison group of nonintubated patients was also studied. Weight increased for 48% of the intubated group versus 17% of the nonintubated group (P less than .01). Aspiration pneumonia occurred more often in the intubated group (58%) than in the nonintubated group (17%) (P less than .01). Decubitus ulcers were also more common in the intubated group (21%) than in the nonintubated group (14%). Restraints were used more in the intubated group (71%) than in the nonintubated group (56%). These differences did not reach statistical significance. All of the intubated patients were severely demented, with MMSE scores of zero. Seventy-one percent of the nonintubated group were demented, with MMSE scores of less than 23. Prolongation of the terminal phase of dementia in the aged by tube feeding is now feasible.

"Effects of interferon on intrahepatic human leukocyte antigens and lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. We investigated the effects of interferon therapy on hepatocyte human leukocyte antigen class I and class II antigen expression and intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (n = 11) and C (n = 10). Interferon-alpha was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 3 to 18 million international units daily for 4 wk. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained just before and immediately after treatment, and the specimens were stained by the indirect immunoperoxidase method for evaluation of human leukocyte antigen expression and lymphocyte subsets. Before therapy, no significant difference was noted between hepatitis B and C in human leukocyte antigen class I antigen expression on hepatocytes or in the lymphocyte subsets in the intralobular and portal areas. After interferon-alpha treatment, hepatocyte expression of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens and serum beta 2-microglobulin levels were virtually unchanged in chronic viral hepatitis C patients, but both were increased in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. Human leukocyte antigen class II antigens were not expressed during treatment. The mean number of intralobular CD3+ and CD8+ cells and the mean serum ALT level decreased significantly in chronic viral hepatitis C patients (p less than 0.05) but not in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. The mean number of intralobular CD4+ cells was unaffected by interferon therapy in both groups. In all 21 patients, the changes in CD8+ cell numbers paralleled the changes in serum ALT levels. Our findings suggest that T-cell cytotoxicity may play an important role in hepatocyte damage in both chronic viral hepatitis C and chronic viral hepatitis B and that the response to interferon-alpha differs in these two types of hepatitis.",Virus_Diseases
"The effect of local temperature versus sympathetic tone on digital perfusion in Raynaud's phenomenon. Matched groups of 7 to 8 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, systemic sclerosis, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease and cold-tolerant normal control subjects were studied by simultaneous digital strain gauge plethysmography and laser Doppler capillary velocimetry during two controlled cycles of hand warming and cooling with and without addition of central cooling and during clinical maneuvers to evoke sympathetic tone. Transient vasoconstrictor responses of comparable degree could be evoked in all patient groups and in both the arterial and microvascular beds. While the addition of central cooling had little influence on arterial flow, patients with systemic sclerosis manifested a failure to maintain nutritive perfusion at finger temperatures associated with Raynaud's phenomenon. Linear regression and multivariate analysis suggested that finger temperature was the principal determinant of arterial flow in systemic sclerosis and that arterial flow was the principal determinant of microvascular perfusion. The inability of patients with systemic sclerosis to maintain nutritive flow in the face of either reflex or cold-induced proximal arterial constriction is consistent with their clinical propensity to ischemic tissue injury and separates these patients physiologically from other forms of Raynaud's phenomenon.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Safety and pharmacokinetics of rimantadine small-particle aerosol. The safety and pharmacokinetics of rimantadine administered by small-particle aerosol were assessed in healthy adults and adults with acute influenza virus infection. Aerosolized rimantadine delivered at a concentration of 40 micrograms/liter of air was associated with nasal burning and irritation in normal volunteers. A concentration of 20 micrograms/liter of air was well tolerated for up to 12 h by normal volunteers and was not associated with any changes in pulmonary function, as measured by routine spirometry, plethysmography, or diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. Mean peak levels of drug in serum were approximately 10-fold lower after 12 h of aerosol administration than they were after oral administration of 200 mg (29.7 versus 255 ng/ml, respectively), while mean nasal wash levels were approximately 100-fold higher (6,650 versus 66.6 ng/ml, respectively). Elimination half-lives were similar after both aerosol and oral administration (24.1 and 25.2 h, respectively), and rimantadine urinary excretion was less than 1% per 24 h in both groups. Twenty micrograms of aerosolized rimantadine per liter of air given 12 h daily for 3 days to nine adults with acute influenza virus infection was well tolerated. Levels in plasma after 12 h of aerosol inhalation were similar to those in normal volunteers, but were higher at the end of the third treatment than they were at the end of the first treatment (88.3 versus 47.9 ng/ml, respectively). Thus, rimantadine delivered via small-particle aerosol at a dose of 20 micrograms/liter of air was well tolerated in normal volunteers and in those with acute influenza and was associated with high local concentrations.",Virus_Diseases
"Human immunodeficiency virus DNA is present in a high percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes of seropositive individuals. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects predominantly CD4+ cells in human peripheral blood and infection is associated with CD4+ lymphocyte dysfunction in patients with AIDS. To determine the frequency of HIV-1 infection in CD4+ lymphocytes in vivo, peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from HIV-1-infected persons with clinical disease ranging from asymptomatic to AIDS. Using standard and booster polymerase chain reaction analyses, study patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) were found to harbor the HIV-1 genome in at least 10% of CD4+ lymphocytes, and approximately 10-fold less infected cells were found in those with asymptomatic infection. In addition, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with ARC frequently contained a higher absolute number of HIV-1-infected CD4+ lymphocytes than those with AIDS or asymptomatic infection. It is likely that this high level of infection of CD4+ lymphocytes is the primary cause for the progressive immunologic deficiency observed in patients infected with HIV-1.",Virus_Diseases
"Silica-associated systemic sclerosis is clinically, serologically and immunologically indistinguishable from idiopathic systemic sclerosis. To determine whether the clinical, immunological and serological features of patients with silica-associated systemic sclerosis are different from patients with the 'idiopathic' form of systemic sclerosis (SS) we studied 22 underground coal miners who were exposed to silica dust (SD), 30 mine workers who later developed silicosis (S) and 17 mine workers exposed to silica dust who subsequently developed a systemic sclerosis-like disease (SA-SS). The patients with SA-SS had features clinically indistinguishable from individual patients with SS. They all had Raynaud's phenomenon, 14 had cutaneous sclerosis identical to that seen in acrosclerosis and three had a generalized cutaneous sclerosis. Sixteen patients had bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis, 10 had necrosis of the fingertip pulps, nine had oesophageal involvement and only one patient had renal involvement. Antinuclear antibodies and circulating immune complexes were detected in three and eight patients with SD, 14 and five patients with S and in 16 and nine patients with SA-SS, respectively. Anti-Scl-70 antibody was detected in eight of the 17 patients with SA-SS. Evidence for in vivo endothelial cell damage, as determined by elevated levels of von Willebrand factor, was found in nine patients with SD, 14 patients with S and in 10 patients with SA-SS. Following incubation of the patient's serum with confluent cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells there was only a significant reduction in calcium ionophore-induced release of prostacyclin with the serum from SA-SS patients compared to that with control serum (NC). The mean +/- SEM release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of prostacyclin expressed as ng/10(4) cells) decreased from 2.90 +/- 0.27 to 2.01 +/- 0.33 (SD), 3.34 +/- 0.42 to 1.76 +/- 0.31 (S), 1.98 +/- 0.12 to 0.64 +/- 0.07 (SA-SS) and 2.28 +/- 0.33 to 1.36 +/- 0.21 (NC) with 1 and 20% serum, respectively. This study demonstrates that immune complex and antinuclear antibody formation and in vivo endothelial cell damage occurs following occupational exposure to silica. The patients who subsequently develop a systemic sclerosis-like disease have clinical, immunological and serological features which are indistinguishable from the idiopathic form of the disease although as a group the SA-SS patients have a higher prevalence of pulmonary involvement and the anti-Scl-70 antibody.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Intestinal flora of patients with rheumatoid arthritis: induction of chronic arthritis in rats by cell wall fragments from isolated Eubacterium aerofaciens strains. The composition of the obligate anaerobic intestinal flora of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) differed from that of healthy subjects (HS). Total numbers of aerobes as well as anaerobic coccoid rods were found elevated when compared with HS. Eubacterium species were found in all stool samples of both groups; Bifidobacterium species were present in seven (RA) and eight (HS) out of 10 subjects. From the flora of two RA patients and two HS Eubacterium species were isolated and identified. Cell wall fragments from four E. aerofaciens strains (two from RA, two from HS) were tested for arthritis induction in rats. All four strains induced chronic arthritis which was histologically confirmed. We concluded that in the normal intestinal flora of RA patients Eubacterium species are present in high numbers (i.e. greater than 10(9)/g faeces); cell walls from isolated E. aerofaciens strains had arthropathic properties.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Occurrence of multiple types of human papillomavirus in genital tract lesions. Analysis by in situ hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction. More than 22 types of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been detected in genital tract squamous cell intraepithelial lesions. Seven of two hundred eighty-six (2.4%) genital tract tissues in which HPV DNA was detected by in situ hybridization contained two or more different HPV types. When analyzed by site, 5 of 204 (2.4%) of cervical intraepithelial lesions were infected by more than one type, compared with 2 of 82 (2.4%) of vulvar lesions. The rate for low-grade lesions was similar (5/218; 2.3%) to that for high-grade lesions (2/68; 2.9%). In contrast, two different HPV types were detected in 6/33 (18%) of tissues by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using type-specific primers for eight HPV types. It is concluded that infection by one HPV type is rarely associated with concurrent 'active' infection by a second HPV type, even though DNA of a different viral type can be detected by PCR in about one fifth of such cases. Further study is required to determine if an existing HPV infection can inhibit replication by a different HPV type.",Virus_Diseases
"Production of platelet derived growth factor B chain (PDGF-B/c-sis) mRNA and immunoreactive PDGF B-like polypeptide by rheumatoid synovium: coexpression with heparin binding acidic fibroblast growth factor-1. We present evidence supporting the hypothesis that locally produced platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) B-like polypeptides, as well as heparin binding growth factor-1 (HBGF-1), are involved in stimulating the pronounced hyperplasia of rheumatoid synovial stromal fibroblastlike cells. Explanted rheumatoid synovial tissues in vitro spontaneously secreted, in a time dependent manner, mitogenic activity for rheumatoid synoviocytes that was neutralizable by anti-PDGF antibody. PDGF B/c-sis mRNA transcripts were detected in synovium from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 5). Spontaneous PDGF B-like synthesis was detected by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled PDGF B-like polypeptides secreted by explanted tissues. Furthermore, rheumatoid synovial tissues, particularly macrophage-like cells, immunostained specifically with anti-PDGF B chain. The extent and intensity of staining and mononuclear cell infiltration were highly correlated. Immunostaining of osteoarthritic and normal synovial tissues was significantly less than RA synovium. PDGF-B immunostaining of synovial specimens previously characterized for expression of HBGF-1, the precursor of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), revealed that the extent and intensity of expression of HBGF-1 and PDGF-B were highly correlated.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Occupational dermatoses from epoxy resin compounds. This study comprises 40 patients with skin disorders from current or previous occupational exposure to epoxy resin compounds (ERC) during 1984-1988. ERCs were the 3rd most common cause (32 of 264 cases: 12.1%) of currently relevant allergic contact dermatitis: 23 cases from epoxy resins based on the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA-ERs), 5 from reactive diluents, 1 from amine hardeners (DETA), and 3 from epoxy acrylates. 2 cases (0.8%) of irritant contact dermatitis were due to ERCs. Methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA, an epoxy hardener) caused 1 case of contact urticaria. Previously relevant occupational allergic contact dermatitis from DGEBA-ERs was detected in 5 cases.

"Rheumatoid arthritis of the knee: value of gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging. In an attempt to differentiate among joint effusion, synovitis, pannus, and subchondral sclerosis in patients with clinically proved chronic rheumatoid arthritis, we used gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging to examine 23 patients with acute knee symptoms. All patients had had rheumatoid arthritis for more than 6 months and satisfied four or more of the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association for rheumatoid arthritis. MR imaging was performed on a 1.5-T machine by using unenhanced T1-weighted spin-echo imaging, unenhanced T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging, and unenhanced and enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo imaging. Signal intensities of the synovium and bone marrow were measured with the region-of-interest technique on unenhanced and enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo scans. Conventional radiographs were available for each patient. Joint effusion, synovitis, intraarticular pannus, subchondral sclerosis, and subchondral pannus had the same signal intensities on unenhanced T1-weighted spin-echo, unenhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo, and unenhanced T2*-weighted gradient-echo MR images, and could not be differentiated from one another. On enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences, pannus and synovitis showed marked enhancement in 15 patients, whereas joint effusion and sclerosis did not. Synovitis was diagnosed if the synovial membrane showed high enhancement; pannus was diagnosed if enhancing masses were seen within the joint space or in the subchondral area. In eight of the 23 joints, there was no enhancement of the synovium or intraarticular or subchondral tissue. We conclude that gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging allows differentiation between synovitis and joint effusion and between subchondral pannus and subchondral sclerosis. Enhancement of the synovium and pannus indicates acute inflammation of the joint.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Screening of selected male blood donors for p24 antigen of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The Transfusion Safety Study Group. BACKGROUND. The p24 antigen of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is sometimes detected before antibody (anti-HIV-1) is detectable in the serum of recently infected persons. This has led to the consideration of p24-antigen testing for routine screening of blood donors. METHODS. To estimate how many HIV-infected seronegative donors would be identified if p24-antigen screening was introduced, we tested selected donations from a repository of 200,000 serum samples from voluntary donors that was established in late 1984 and early 1985. The 8597 serum samples selected for p24-antigen screening were chosen because their donors had demographic characteristics known to be associated with a high prevalence of seropositivity. RESULTS. The prevalence of anti-HIV-1 antibodies in the 1984-1985 serum samples selected for p24-antigen screening was 1.54 percent--more than 100 times the 0.012 percent prevalence in present-day donations in the United States. The antigen was detected in 15 of 132 serum samples (11.4 percent) from donors who had already been confirmed as seropositive. No instance of confirmed positivity for p24 antigen was found among the 8465 seronegative serum samples. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that the yield of screening for p24 antigen in volunteer donors to identify HIV-1 carriers would be negligible. We therefore recommend against routine screening with currently available p24-antigen assays.",Virus_Diseases
"Diminished incidence of severe rheumatoid arthritis associated with oral contraceptive use. It has been suggested that the negative association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and oral contraceptive (OC) use might be limited to the more severe forms of RA. To investigate this further, we studied 121 consecutive female patients with definite RA, 52 female patients with probable RA, and 378 female controls. All patients had RA symptoms of recent onset. After a mean followup period of 6 years, patients with definite RA were classified as having either a severe disease course (n = 76) or a mild disease course (n = 45). The negative association between OC use prior to the onset of RA symptoms and the development of RA was limited to those patients with definite RA who had a severe disease course. We therefore conclude that OC use prior to the onset of RA symptoms is only associated with a reduction in the incidence of severe RA. This may explain the divergent results of previous studies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Intermediate alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency with apical lung bullae and spontaneous pneumothorax. Presence of a Z variant in an American black. A 43-year-old black man had an 18-year history of apical lung cystic-bullous disease. Following two episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax and two instances of thoracotomy for bullectomy and pleural abrasion, he was found to have an intermediate AAT deficiency with an MZ phenotype. It is believed that this is the first case of localized bullous lung disease to be reported in association with any degree of AAT deficiency. There is evidence that the cystic lesions progressed to form upper lobe bullae. It is postulated that the AAT deficiency may have played a role in this progression, as did the patient's cigarette smoking. Following two instances of surgery, CT scans of the lungs, compliance studies and complete pulmonary function tests show no further evidence of lung bullae or emphysema. The rarity of the Z variant of AAT in blacks is discussed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"An immunohistological study of desmosomes in Darier's disease and Hailey-Hailey disease. The immunocytochemical distribution of desmosomal components was determined in involved skin from eight patients with Darier's disease, five patients with Hailey-Hailey disease and two patients with transient acantholytic dermatosis as well as skin from four normal controls. Sections were stained using monoclonal antibodies to the desmosomal proteins dp1 and dp2 (desmoplakins) and the desmosomal glycoproteins dg1 (desmoglein), and dg2 and dg3 (desmocollins). There was normal expression of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins at the periphery of the keratinocytes in the perilesional skin in Darier's disease, in Hailey-Hailey disease and in transient acantholytic dermatosis. In the lesional skin there was reduced expression of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins in the basaloid 'buds' at the base of the lesions, but there was bright diffuse staining of the acantholytic cells. Focal intracellular staining was detected within many of the acantholytic keratinocytes in Hailey-Hailey disease and within some of these cells in Darier's disease. Suction blisters were used to induce fresh acantholysis in lesional skin in Darier's disease and clinically uninvolved skin in Hailey-Hailey disease. The results indicated that acantholysis precedes the development of intracellular staining. Although there are immunopathological abnormalities in the distribution of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins in both Darier's disease and Hailey-Hailey disease, the changes are probably secondary to internalization of desmosomal components with breakdown and redistribution of antigens rather than a primary deficiency in the synthesis of these proteins. Focal internalization was more widespread in Hailey-Hailey disease than in Darier's disease and the differences in the distribution of desmosomal components in these diseases confirm that they are distinct entities.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection was identified on the basis of a callback blood testing. Two thirds of the HIV-1-infected children were asymptomatic at time of enrollment in the study of development. The children were administered two psychological batteries approximately 8 months apart. The results indicated that the two serostatus groups did not differ in overall intelligence, even as long as 8 years after HIV-1 infection.

"The impact of rheumatoid arthritis on the household work performance of women. We conducted a study to assess whether and to what degree household work disability exists in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to examine the role of health versus family and personal factors as predictors of household work disability. In addition, the participation of other family members and paid employees in household work was evaluated. One hundred forty-two women with RA and 58 female friends/neighbors completed questionnaires which assessed household work performance and health, family, and personal variables. Performance was measured in 4 ways: the current amount of time spent on household work, the proportion of the household work done, and the changes in time and proportion since just before the onset of RA. Functional status was measured via the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Pain, anxiety and depression, and general health perception were measured via the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales. The results indicate that household work disability exists in women with RA, but is substantial only in women with moderate-to-severe disease. In families in which the wife/mother has moderate-to-severe RA, the other family members spend 7 hours more per week on household work than in control families, but there was no increase in the use of paid household employees. Health factors were the strongest predictors of household work disability, but family and personal factors also had significant effects. Household work disability in women with moderate or severe RA merits more attention because of the importance of household work to family functioning and the negative effects that changes in this area can produce.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Late effects of paralytic poliomyelitis in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We identified a cohort of 300 individuals who had paralytic polio between 1935 and 1955. All lived in Olmsted County, Minnesota.

Sixty-four percent of these 50 survivors complained of new symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue, and weakness after a period of prolonged stability. This led to changes in lifestyle or activity in only 18%. The likelihood of expressing new complaints was not related to present age or interval since polio, and electrophysiologic testing did not distinguish between those with or without new problems. The development of new difficulties in a limb was most strongly predicted by significant paralysis of that limb at the time of the acute illness. Patients with leg weakness were twice as likely to complain of new problems compared to those with arm weakness.

"Protection against zosteriform spread of herpes simplex virus by monoclonal antibodies. The in vivo protective role of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1)-specific antibody was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reactive with discrete antigenic sites on glycoproteins B, C, and D (gB, gC, gD) in the murine zosteriform spread model of HSV-1. All of the anti-gC and anti-gD MAbs, and one of four anti-gB MAbs (B6) were protective. The in vitro abilities of the MAbs to neutralize HSV-1 and mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HSV-1-infected cells were examined as potential mechanistic correlates to in vivo protection. All animals given MAbs at high ADCC unit doses were protected. Some but not all mice given MAbs at high ADCC unit doses were protected. These studies designate specific epitopes recognized by protective antibodies and indicate that protection from the neurologic spread of HSV may be related to neutralization, ADCC, or both.

In 1984, Greek physicians reported on the clustering of cases of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) on the Peloponnesus peninsula. To gain more insight into its pathogenesis, we studied the seroepidemiologic and clinicopathologic characteristics of 12 Greek KS patients (eight male/four female) five of whom were residents of an endemic area on the Peloponnesus. These patients were in good general health with ages ranging from 48 to 80 years, had no clinical signs of immunodeficiency, and combined the features of both classic and epidemic KS in that they displayed not only involvement of acral areas but also widespread mucocutaneous lesions. Routine laboratory data were within normal limits; no patient had HTLV-1 and HIV-1/2 antibodies, but all patients had antibodies to several herpesviruses. The histopathology was characteristic of KS with the peculiar feature of a dense infiltrate composed predominantly of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Immunoenzymatic/morphologic studies of the KS cells were consistent with their origin from lymphatic endothelium. Outstanding ultrastructural findings were tubuloreticular structures and cylindrical confronting cisternae, structures that are indicative of an ongoing viral infection. Indeed, extensive electronmicroscopic studies resulted in the detection of retrovirus-like particles in close association to KS cells in five of 12 patients.

Because cholestasis of pregnancy has a high prevalence in Chile and a deleterious effect on fetal prognosis, we decided to verify the efficacy of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in this disease. Eighteen patients with pruritus that appeared during pregnancy and with elevated serum levels of bile salts (68.1 +/- 15.9 mumol/L; mean +/- S.E.M.) and ALT (226 +/- 50 KU/L) were enrolled in a prospective double-blind study comparing the effects of the drug with a placebo. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine, 900 mg, or placebo was administered in daily intravenous infusions for 20 days. Every 5 days liver function tests were done and pruritus was assessed using a preestablished score. No significant differences in pruritus or in serum levels of bile salts, ALT, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatases were seen during or after treatment between patients who received S-adenosyl-L-methionine (n = 9) or placebo (n = 9). No relevant adverse reactions were detected. Most patients had cesarean sections because of reasons unrelated to the therapeutic trial. All newborns had Apgar scores greater than 7 and normal postnatal development. Our patients had moderately severe to severe cholestasis of pregnancy as indicated by the onset of pruritus before wk 32 of pregnancy. Seven of nine multiparous patients had a past history of recurrent cholestasis of pregnancy. In this study, the administration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine during 20 days did not improve intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A report of eight HIV-seropositive patients with major depression responding to fluoxetine. This pilot study examined the effectiveness of fluoxetine in depressed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive asymptomatic patients. Eight patients, participating in an AZT trial who met criteria for major depression syndrome (DSM-III-R), were treated with fluoxetine (20 or 40 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Initially, mean Hamilton Depression scores were 23.8 (range of 17-31), and improved to 6.4 (range of 3-10). All subjects maintained their remission over a 2-month follow-up. Fluoxetine treatment may be effective in treating major depression in HIV-seropositive asymptomatic patients.",Virus_Diseases

"Sodium lauryl sulphate for irritant patch testing--a dose-response study using bioengineering methods for determination of skin irritation. The dose-response relationship in patch testing with sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) was studied. The irritant skin response was quantified by visual scoring as well as by the following noninvasive methods: measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) by an evaporimeter, measurement of skin color by a colorimeter, measurement of superficial blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry, and measurement of edema in the skin by ultrasound A-scan. Twelve volunteers were patch tested with 0.12, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.00% SLS, and the skin response was evaluated after 24 and 48 h, respectively. We found a statistically significant linear dose-response relationship between dose of SLS and skin response evaluated by measurement of TEWL, skin color, superficial blood flow, and edema. Statistical evaluation by regression analysis proved measurement of TEWL to be the method best suited overall for quantification in relation to patch testing with SLS, whereas colorimetry was found to be the least sensitive of the applied methods. Ultrasound A-scan was found to be a promising method for quantification of the inflammatory response, being consistently more sensitive than measurement of skin color.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"The acute aseptic meningitis syndrome. The acute aseptic meningitis syndrome is an entity that presents a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. Although many infectious and noninfectious etiologies exist for this syndrome, viruses, especially nonpolio enteroviruses, are the classic and most important agents encountered. The incidence of polio and mumps meningitis has declined dramatically in the vaccine era, but recently described pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease agent) are now important considerations in the differential diagnosis. Specifically treatable entities (eg, mycobacterial or fungal meningitis, herpes simplex encephalitis, parameningeal infection) that may mimic aseptic meningitis in their initial presentations must not be overlooked. A careful approach to the patient and a rational use of laboratory studies are the basis for establishing a specific diagnosis and assuring a favorable outcome.",Virus_Diseases
"CD4% is the best predictor of development of AIDS in a cohort of HIV-infected homosexual men. To determine the relationships between individuals' baseline T-cell subsets, their rates of change with time, and AIDS-free survival time, data were collected at 6-monthly intervals from 379 HIV-seropositive homosexual Sydney men, of whom 31 developed AIDS during the 3-year observation period. Both CD4% and rate of change of CD4% in an individual had significant prognostic value in determining AIDS-free survival time. Compared with subjects whose CD4% remained stable, subjects whose CD4% dropped by 7% or more in a year had a relative hazard of 35.1 (95% confidence interval = 11.7-105.6, P less than 0.001) of developing AIDS. Increasing CD4% had a significant protective effect, reducing the risk of developing AIDS. CD4%, CD4 cell count and CD4: CD8 ratios showed steeper declines in subjects who were later diagnosed with AIDS than in those who remained AIDS-free. The rates of immunological change in AIDS-free seroconverters and seropositives were similar, despite indeterminate differences in durations of infections. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, baseline CD4%, the rate of change of CD4%, and baseline lymphocyte count were associated with AIDS-free survival time. Baseline CD4% had greater prognostic value than baseline CD4 cell count. Baseline CD8%, baseline CD8 count, their rates of change and their mean square errors were not independently significant in this analysis. These findings are important for clinicians monitoring HIV infection in an individual and for entry criteria and monitoring procedures in clinical trials. They also have implications for resource-poor settings; prognosis based on CD4% can be made with a flow cytometer without a full blood count.",Virus_Diseases

"Predictive value of CD4 lymphocyte numbers for the development of opportunistic infections and malignancies in HIV-infected persons. Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in progressive depletion of the CD4 subset T-lymphocytes and the development of opportunistic infections and certain malignancies. Charts were reviewed for 185 HIV-infected individuals with 265 AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) who had T-lymphocyte subset analyses performed within 2 months prior to or 1 month following the diagnosis. Also included were 22 HIV-infected patients with oral candidiasis and 20 with asymptomatic infection. Significant differences in CD4 lymphocyte numbers were observed between the 12 ADIs, oral candidiasis, and asymptomatic infection, allowing them to be grouped into five general categories, based on mean CD4 count: (a) asymptomatic infection, CD4 greater than 500/mm3; (b) oral candidiasis and tuberculosis, range 250-500/mm3; (c) Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and cryptosporidiosis, range 150-200/mm3; (d) Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex, herpes simplex ulceration, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and esophageal candidiasis, range 75-125/mm3; (e) cytomegalovirus retinitis, less than 50/mm3.

"Evidence for the effects of a superantigen in rheumatoid arthritis. While studying the alpha beta T cell receptor repertoire in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, we found that the frequency of V beta 14+ T cells was significantly higher in the synovial fluid of affected joints than in the peripheral blood. In fact, V beta 14+ T cells were virtually undetectable in the peripheral blood of a majority of these RA patients. beta-chain sequences indicated that one or a few clones dominated the V beta 14+ population in the synovial fluid of individual RA patients, whereas oligoclonality was less marked for other V beta's and for V beta 14 in other types of inflammatory arthritis. These results implicate V beta 14-bearing T cells in the pathology of RA. They also suggest that the etiology of RA may involve initial activation of V beta 14+ T cells by a V beta 14-specific superantigen with subsequent recruitment of a few activated autoreactive v beta 14+ T cell clones to the joints while the majority of other V beta 14+ T cells disappear.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Free-tissue transfers for limb salvage utilizing in situ saphenous vein bypass conduit as the inflow. Using vein grafts to bypass sclerotic and occluded arterial segments is a well-established technique in vascular surgery. For infrapopliteal bypass, autogenous veins have better patency rates than synthetic grafts. Although not resolved, in situ bypasses seem to be better than reversed bypasses, especially for ""far away"" segments. Although the etiology is not understood, it is a well-known clinical finding that sclerosis affects arteries more than the veins and, as a whole, is more advanced in lower extremities compared with the trunk and upper extremities. Our experience with eight patients in whom critical soft-tissue defects were covered with free-tissue transfers in severely compromised lower extremities utilizing the in situ saphenous vein bypass as the inflow is presented. Simultaneous bypass and free-tissue transfers were performed in seven and delayed free-tissue transfer was done in one. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 3 years. To date, two patients underwent amputations. Five patients are able to maintain bipedal ambulation. One patient is wheelchair-bound with intact lower extremities. In well-selected patients, this procedure may offer an alternative treatment to amputation.

"High antigen reactivity in mononuclear cells from sites of chronic inflammation. Antigen-specific in-vitro responses of mononuclear cells from synovial fluid and peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis were compared with those of mononuclear cells from pleural exudate and peripheral blood of non-rheumatoid-arthritis patients with chronic pleuritis not caused by tuberculosis. The antigens tested were an acetone-precipitable fraction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (AP-Mt), an Escherichia coli lysate containing the 65 kD heat-shock protein of M bovis BCG (65 kD/E coli), the M bovis heat-shock protein alone (65 kD), and E coli alone. The mean proliferative responses to AP-Mt were higher in synovial-fluid than in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in rheumatoid arthritis patients (mean [SEM] stimulation index 10.5 [3.1] vs 2.6 [0.9]) and in pleural-exudate than in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in the pleuritic patients (7.5 [1.7] vs 3.5 [2.0]). The same pattern was seen for the other three antigens. Only 1 of 26 synovial-fluid mononuclear cell samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients showed a positive response (stimulation index 3 or more) to 65 kD compared with 5 of 22 pleural-exudate mononuclear cell samples, so 65 kD seems not to be the major antigen recognised by synovial-fluid T cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Enhanced reactivity against mycobacterial and other bacterial antigens is not restricted to mononuclear cells from chronically inflamed joints but seems to be a common feature of chronic inflammation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"HLA association with dermatitis herpetiformis is accounted for by a cis or transassociated DQ heterodimer. HLA-DR, DQ, and DP restriction fragment genotyping was undertaken in 23 dermatitis herpetiformis patients and 53 healthy control subjects. HLA-DQw2 was present in 100% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (23 of 23) versus 40% of control subjects (21 of 53). Significant secondary associations occurred with HLA-DR3 (91% of patients versus 28% of control subjects) and DPw1 (39% of patients versus 11% of control subjects). Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease thus share an identical HLA class II association. It is likely that HLA class II genes directly influence the immune responses leading to mucosal damage in both diseases. The strongest candidate for disease susceptibility to dermatitis herpetiformis is DQw2. The HLA molecule most likely to be involved in coeliac disease is a specific DQ alpha/DQ beta heterodimer, encoded in cis arrangement in DR3 haplotypes or in trans arrangement in a DR5, 7 genotype. Our data on dermatitis herpetiformis patients fits this model perfectly. All these patients are capable of expressing this molecule, which may be responsible for the gluten sensitive enteropathy seen in a subgroup of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Transmission of HIV-1 infections from mothers to infants in Haiti. Impact on childhood mortality and malnutrition. The CDS/JHU AIDS Project Team. Of 4588 pregnant women in a high-risk Haitian population, 443 (9.7%) were serologically positive for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Infants born to women who were HIV-1 seropositive were more likely to be premature, of low birth weight, and malnourished at 3 and 6 months of age than were infants born to women who were HIV-1 seronegative. Increased mortality was observed in infants born to women who were HIV-1 seropositive by 3 months of age. At 12 months of age, 23.4% of the infants born to women who were HIV-1 seropositive had died compared with 10.8% of the infants born to women who were HIV-1 seronegative; at 24 months of age, the mortality rates were 31.3% and 14.2%, respectively. Maternal HIV-1 infections resulted in an 11.7% increase in the overall infant mortality rate in this population.

"Arthritis and mast cell activation. The significance of the mast cell in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases continues to receive attention. Increased numbers of mast cells are found in the synovial tissue and fluid of patients with inflammatory arthritides, and these mast cells can be activated by many of the substances found in inflammatory synovial fluid. This activation results in the release of mediators that are capable of amplifying the inflammatory process within the joint space. Recent research has shown that mast cells also produce a variety of cytokines and hematopoietic growth factors that may have paracrine and autocrine functions that are important to the development of the inflammatory cell infiltrate. Increased numbers of mast cells are also found in many fibrotic conditions, including scleroderma. These mast cells, directly or through mediator generation, affect the function of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and growth factors important to the proliferation and function of these cells. A clearer understanding of mast cell involvement in the inflammatory arthritides and fibrotic processes should lead to new therapeutic strategies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"An evaluation of the polymerase chain reaction in HIV-1 seronegative men. The apparent detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seronegative individuals has been the subject of great concern. In this study, 324 seronegative participants in the San Francisco Men's Health Study were evaluated for evidence of infection using a PCR testing algorithm with multiple amplifications targeting different regions of the HIV-1 genome. While most PCR reactions were negative, 8.6% of the specimens showed weak reactivity with one or more primer sets. However, all were negative with at least one primer set and no definitively positive specimens were identified. This study addressed the possibility that some of these PCR reactions might represent latent infection or abortive exposure, leaving residual integrated DNA, rather than false-positive reactions. The frequency of such reactions was determined in homosexual men who have been at risk for HIV-1 infection and in exclusively heterosexual men who have little or no past exposure. The results demonstrate an identical frequency and distribution of equivocal PCR reactions in both populations. Assuming that there is minimal HIV-1 infection among seronegative heterosexual men in San Francisco, we conclude that PCR testing does not provide evidence for a reservoir of occult HIV-1 infection in seronegative homosexual men.",Virus_Diseases
"Immunochemical studies of ferrochelatase protein: characterization of the normal and mutant protein in bovine and human protoporphyria. Protoporphyria is a hereditary disorder characterized by a marked decrease in the activity of ferrochelatase, the terminal enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. We have prepared specific polyvalent antibodies against bovine ferrochelatase in rabbits. The specificity of the antibody preparation against ferrochelatase was demonstrated by western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation of ferrochelatase activity. The antibody also cross-reacted weakly with ferrochelatase from human mitochondria. To quantify immunoreactive ferrochelatase in tissue samples, a kinetic-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (k-ELISA) was developed. Ferrochelatase activity and the level of immunoreactive protein were measured in hepatic mitochondria isolated from six normal and nine protoporphyric (homozygous) cattle. Ferrochelatase activity was less than 10% of normal in mitochondria from protoporphyric animals; the amount of immunoreactive material was equivalent to that from normal animals. Similar studies were performed with samples from three normal and two protoporphyric (heterozygous) humans. Ferrochelatase activity was decreased in protoporphyric samples (about 17% of normal, but there was no concomitant decrease in immunoreactive material. These data demonstrate that a normal amount of ferrochelatase protein is present and suggest that bovine and human protoporphyria result from point mutations in the gene encoding ferrochelatase.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Substance p-induced cutaneous and bronchial reactions in children with bronchial asthma. We studied substance P-induced cutaneous and bronchial reactions in children with allergic disorders. Furthermore, inhibitory effects of lidocaine on these responses elicited by substance P were also studied. In the intradermal test, children with moderate or severe bronchial asthma showed significantly stronger reactions than controls. In bronchial challenge with substance P, children with bronchial asthma showed an increasing fall in FEV1 and V50 in proportion to the severity of their asthma. Concomitant use of lidocaine significantly inhibited not only substance P-induced intradermal erythema and wheal reactions but air flow limitations. It also inhibited histamine-induced erythema and house dust-induced wheal and erythema reactions. No adverse reactions to lidocaine were observed. These results suggest that substance P might play an important role in cutaneous and bronchial hypersensitivity reactions in humans and that lidocaine has an inhibitory effect on substance P-induced reactions.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Inhibition of Langerhans cell ATPase and contact sensitization by lanthanides--role of T-suppressor cells. Lanthanides are rare earths, elements 55-71 in the periodic table, that are of interest in biologic systems as isomorphic competitors for calcium binding sites. Lanthanides were tested for their inhibitory influence on the Ca++/Mg(++)-dependent ATPase of epidermal langerhans cells in vitro, and on the immunologic function of Langerhans cells in vivo. The trivalent ions of lanthanides, lanthanum, and cerium completely inhibited the ATPase staining of Langerhans cells in vitro. When mice were sensitized with dinitrofluorobenzene on skin sites pretreated with topical lanthanum chloride, and challenged on untreated ear skin, a markedly reduced contact hypersensitivity response was observed. This hyporesponsiveness was found to be antigen specific, and could be passively transferred to naive syngeneic animals recipients by CD4-CD8+ spleen cells. These results suggest that inhibition of the epidermal Langerhans cell surface ATPase by application of topical lanthanum and the induction of antigen-specific immunologic tolerance may be related events.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Recombinant human alpha-interferon in patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis: a multicenter randomized controlled trial from France  We have conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing two doses of recombinant human alpha-interferon for efficacy in 60 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. The source of infection appeared to be transfusion in 30 patients, intravenous drug abuse in 16 patients and was unknown in 14 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to no treatment or to treatment with either 1 or 3 MU of alpha-interferon given three times a week for 24 wk. Forty-five patients (75%) were positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus. During the 24-wk treatment period, mean serum ALT levels decreased in both treatment groups, but the decrease was statistically significant only in the 3 MU group. However, at 24 wk, the proportion of patients with normal ALT levels was similar in the 3 MU group (39%) and the 1 MU group (45%), and both were significantly higher than in controls (0%). Repeat liver biopsy specimens showed a significant decrease in the severity of histological changes in the 3 MU group but not in the 1 MU group or in controls. Responses to alpha-interferon did not correlate with patient's age, gender, source of infection, pretreatment serum ALT, presence of anti-hepatitis C virus or cirrhosis. After treatment, the mean ALT levels rose in both treated groups. The proportion of patients with normal ALT levels at wk 48 was 28% in the 3 MU group and 20% in the 1 MU group.

"High testosterone levels of ovarian origin affect adrenal steroidogenesis? Androgens of ovarian origin have been suggested to affect adrenal enzymatic activity. To investigate this possibility, the 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OH P) and cortisol (F) responses to an ACTH stimulation test (0.25 mg iv, bolus) were evaluated in 10 normal women and in 39 hyperandrogenic women with normal (14 subjects) or high (25 subjects) testosterone (T) levels. The 17-OH P release and the ratio between 17-OH P and F release in response to the ACTH stimulation test were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in hyperandrogenic women with high T levels than in normal subjects. Eight hyperandrogenic women with high T received intranasal GnRH agonist (Buserelin, 1200 micrograms/day) for 4 weeks, and the 17-OH P and F release in response to the ACTH stimulation was reassessed after agonist treatment. At the end of GnRH agonist administration the mean circulating levels of T were significantly reduced (P less than 0.05). The F response to the ACTH test was not modified by pretreatment with the GnRH agonist. The 17-OH P response to the ACTH stimulation test after the GnRH agonist was unchanged in comparison with control tests, as well as the ratio between 17-OH P and F responses to the ACTH test.

(40/690 subjects: 5.8%) were more common in younger age groups, in the allergic contact dermatitis group and in subjects who had used contact lens solutions. In the 40 thimerosal-positive patients, the minimum eliciting quantity of preservative was evaluated using different test concentrations: 0.05% and 0.01% pet.

The results of the investigation demonstrate that many of the reactions to 0.1% thimerosal are probably irritant, because only half the subjects studied had positive patch tests when allergen concentrations 5 to 10x lower than that conventionally used for patch testing, were utilized. In these subjects, the average strength of patch test reactions was higher, intradermal testing was more often positive and cross-reactions between mercurials more frequent.

"Adrenergic regulation of lipolysis in a patient with lipoatrophy of the upper body. A patient with lipoatrophy of the upper body had laboratory evidence of increased activity of the adrenergic nervous system. Because the adrenergic nervous system is important in the regulation of lipolysis, studies were performed to determine whether lipolysis of the upper body was ongoing in this patient and whether pharmacologic reduction of activity of the adrenergic nervous system would affect lipolysis of adipose tissue. Release of free fatty acids from systemic and forearm adipose tissue was measured before and after the administration of guanfacine hydrochloride. Forearm adipose tissue, although decreased in quantity, was found to release normal amounts of free fatty acids. Systemic and forearm release of free fatty acids decreased after 3 days of treatment with guanfacine.

In this report, an 11-year-old boy with diffuse tendinous and tuberous xanthomatosis and a plasma sterol concentration of 555 mg/dL, consisting primarily of cholesterol, is described. Three months after changing from an unrestricted diet to a cholesterol-lowering diet, his plasma sterol concentration decreased to 221 mg/dL. Because of the degree and rapidity of his response to diet, sitosterolemia was suspected. According to results of capillary gas-liquid chromatography of his plasma sterols, there was a sitosterol concentration of 31.3 mg/dL (normal less than 1.0 mg/dL), establishing the diagnosis of sitosterolemia. Addition of cholestyramine therapy (8 g/d) to a low sterol diet further lowered his plasma sterol concentration to 173 mg/dL and led to complete regression of all tuberous xanthomata. Tendinous xanthomata regressed at a slower rate. These findings show that the diagnosis of sitosterolemia should be suspected in severely hypercholesterolemic children (total cholesterol greater than 400 mg/dL) whose plasma cholesterol level is highly responsive to dietary manipulation. The rapid and sustained lowering of plasma cholesterol and regression of xanthomata after treatment with diet and cholestyramine suggest that sitosterolemia is a treatable cause of premature atherosclerosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Human parvovirus B19 and its associated diseases. From the point of view of obstetrics and pediatrics, the importance of B19 infection lies in the potential for intraueterine infection following maternal B19 infection. Ongoing prospective studies of B19 infection in pregnant women indicate a risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes considerably lower than previous estimates from retrospective studies and case reports. The occurrence, however, of severe nonimmune hydrops or stillbirths or both in even a small percentage of progeny of B19-infected pregnant women is a concern. It thus behooves physicians caring for pregnant women and their offspring to be thoroughly familiar with B19 and issues related to B19 infection in pregnancy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Cutaneous manifestations in patients with essential thrombocythemia. In a retrospective study of 268 patients with essential thrombocythemia, related cutaneous manifestations were found in 58 (22%). In 27 cases (10%) the related skin lesions were present at the time of the primary diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. Hematomas, ecchymoses, petechiae, or purpura occurred in 24 (41%) of the 58 patients. Fifteen patients (26%) had erythromelalgia, in 11 of whom it was the initial complaint. Livedo reticularis, recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis, ischemic complications with gangrene, leg ulcers, or ulcers on the toes were other manifestations. Urticaria occurred in two patients, and Raynaud's phenomenon and necrotizing vasculitis were each observed in one patient. Platelet function may be abnormal, and this was found in 13 of 19 patients studied, 9 of whom had spontaneous platelet aggregation. Knowledge of the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythemia may lead to its earlier detection. Prompt diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia is important because treatment may prevent severe hemorrhagic or thrombotic events.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Complement is activated in the upper respiratory tract during influenza virus infection. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether complement is activated in the upper respiratory tract during experimental influenza virus infection in human volunteers. Seven subjects were challenged with influenza A/Bethesda/1/85 (H3N2), and four subjects received placebo. C3a and C5a concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay in nasal lavage fluids before challenge and for 8 days after challenge. A significant increase (p less than 0.05) in C3a and C5a concentrations was demonstrated in lavage fluids from subjects who developed influenza illness as compared with uninfected control subjects and infected subjects who remained asymptomatic. Maximal levels of C3a and C5a were detected during the recovery phase of illness. These results suggest that complement is activated in the airway in response to influenza illness.",Virus_Diseases
Chronic fatigue syndrome: issues in the diagnosis and estimation of incidence. This article critiques the current working definition of chronic fatigue syndrome. The concerns raised about the current working definition are the following: prolonged or excessive exertion is not addressed explicitly; duration and quality of bed rest are not specified; a socioeconomic ascertainment bias is present; data from history and physical findings are not clearly separated and are relegated to minor criteria; and the rigor of neurologic and psychiatric evaluations is not specified. We propose a flow chart that addresses the possible modes of evolution of chronic fatigue syndrome for patients; this chart may yield more homogeneous subgroups of individuals with this syndrome or enable some patients to avert the syndrome.,Virus_Diseases
"Detection of human papillomaviruses in paraffin-embedded condylomata acuminata--comparison of immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used for detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in paraffin-embedded tissue sections of condylomata acuminata. Incorporation of biotinylated nucleotides during the amplification process allows a highly sensitive, fast, and non-isotopic detection of viral DNA in a subsequent Southern dot blot. In 100% (13 of 13) of histologically confirmed condylomata, HPV-6 or -11 could be detected by polymerase chain reaction. By in situ hybridization 77% (10 of 13) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 69% (nine of 13) positive results were obtained. Because HPV genital infection is linked to penile and cervical dysplasia, polymerase chain reaction provides a powerful and highly sensitive tool for epidemiologic studies on sexual transmission of HPV.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The case histories of 27 children with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) who were followed up in the AIDS Program at the Children's Hospital of New Jersey, Newark, are reviewed. The mean and median age at PCP diagnosis were 10.8 and 7.7 months, respectively. All of the children had other clinical evidence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus that was documented prior to the diagnosis of PCP or found at the time of PCP diagnosis. Most patients who presented to the hospital were acutely ill, and complications of treatment occurred in 70%. Overall, 89% of the patients died and 70% survived for less than 6 months after diagnosis of PCP. Median survival after the diagnosis of PCP was only 2.0 months and the median life span of children with PCP was only 14.4 months.

"Persistent airway hyperresponsiveness after neonatal viral bronchiolitis in rats. Viral bronchiolitis in human infants has been associated with permanent changes in small airways and gas exchange and an increased incidence of hyperresponsive airways later in life. Respiratory infection by Sendai virus in neonatal rats also has been reported to cause permanent changes in lung morphology and increased numbers of bronchiolar mast cells and eosinophils. We evaluated pulmonary mechanics, gas exchange, and airway responsiveness in rats at 7 and 13-16 wk after neonatal Sendai virus infection. Rats from the virus group had lower arterial PO2 and increased total lung resistance compared with controls. There were no significant differences between groups for arterial PCO2, dynamic lung compliance, quasi-static respiratory system compliance, or vital capacity. Rats from the infected group were significantly more sensitive to aerosolized methacholine than were controls, although both virus and control groups became less sensitive with age. We conclude that neonatal Sendai virus infection in rats results in persistent alterations in lung function and airway responsiveness. This phenomenon may be valuable for the study of the relationships among airway inflammation, lung morphology, and airway hyperresponsiveness, and it may be relevant to human airway disease.",Virus_Diseases

"Eosinophil activation in systemic sclerosis. Circulating levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were increased 4-fold in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) compared with those in healthy control subjects. There was no correlation between the ECP concentrations and laboratory indices of inflammatory activity or visceral involvement. Mean ECP levels were higher in patients with a history of occupational exposure to silica, even though patients who had no such history also had ECP levels higher than normal. The patients had increased bronchoalveolar levels of ECP, which correlated with impaired lung functioning. Skin infiltration with activated eosinophils and extracellular deposits of ECP were present in skin biopsy samples from the SSc patients.

"Incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis after screening blood donors for antibodies to hepatitis C virus and surrogate markers. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of screening blood donors for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) on the incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in recipients with that of screening blood donors for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and elevated alanine aminotransferase levels. DESIGN: Cohort analysis of serum samples from donors and recipients. Recipients were followed for 12 months to determine the occurrence of non-A, non-B hepatitis. SETTING: The blood-transmitted viruses unit and the liver unit of a university teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: A total of 250 patients who had open heart surgery and their 3142 blood donors. MEASUREMENTS: Donor sera were tested for anti-HCV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and, in the event of a positive result, by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). Antibodies to anti-HBc and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were also measured. Measurements of anti-HCV and ALT activity in recipients were done before transfusion and at regular intervals during follow-up. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 250 transfusion recipients, 40 developed non-A, non-B hepatitis. Of the 3142 donors, 70 were positive for anti-HCV by ELISA, 440 were positive for anti-HBc, and 177 had alanine aminotransferase levels between 0.67 and 1.33 mukat/L. The sensitivity (87%), specificity (89%), positive predictive value (59%), and negative predictive value (97%) of blood-donor screening were higher for anti-HCV than for anti-HBc (82%, 36%, 21%, and 91%, respectively) and 70%, 29%, and 91%, respectively). The expected number of donors excluded because of the presence of anti-HCV was considerably smaller than that of donors with positive results for surrogate markers of hepatitis. CONCLUSION: Screening blood donors for the presence of anti-HCV is more accurate than screening for surrogate markers (anti-HBc and ALT) and protects more effectively against post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis.",Virus_Diseases
"Cerebrospinal norepinephrine concentrations and the duration of epidural analgesia  This study was performed to determine whether the addition of norepinephrine to local anaesthetics prolongs epidural analgesia in man. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured. In the first part of the study, epidural catheters were inserted in 14 patients before herniotomy. Mepivacaine, 1.5 per cent (0.35 ml.kg-1), was administered and norepinephrine (5 micrograms.ml-1) was added in seven patients. The duration of anaesthesia was prolonged from 54 +/- 11 min to 83 +/- 12 min (P less than 0.05) and CSF NE concentrations increased from 68 +/- 12 pg.ml-1 to 336 +/- 85 pg.ml-1 in the NE group (P less than 0.01). In the second part, eight patients with herpetic neuralgia received epidural analgesia at the fourth to eighth thoracic interspace, using bupivacaine 0.25 per cent, with and without NE. The CSF NE concentrations in this group were greater than in the surgical patients before operation and increased from 254 +/- 58 to 406 +/- 58 pg.ml-1 30 min after administration of bupivacaine with NE. The duration of pain relief was prolonged with NE. These results suggest that adding NE to local anaesthetics prolongs epidural analgesia. Moreover, NE concentrations in surgical patients increased to levels similar to those found in patients suffering from herpetic analgesia. This suggests that the increase of CSF NE in chronic pain states has an antinociceptive effect.",Virus_Diseases
"Prospective evaluation of posttransfusion hepatitis. The incidence of posttransfusion hepatitis (PTH) was determined prospectively at our institution. An active surveillance program of transfused surgical patients was set up; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were determined before transfusion and at monthly intervals for 6 months after transfusion. Patients with confirmed ALT values greater than 2.5 times the upper reference values were referred to the out-patient clinics for diagnosis. Of 4051 surgical patients who underwent transfusion between January 1986 and December 1989, 2459 (60.7%) were enrolled in the surveillance program, and 1018 (25.1%) completed the follow-up; 238 patients received autologous blood only and were used as controls. No PTH was observed in the control patients, and the incidence of the disease in patients receiving homologous blood was 10.97 percent in 1986, 6.58 percent in 1987, 5.55 percent in 1988, and 4.29 percent in 1989; the decreasing trend is significant (p = 0.018).",Virus_Diseases

"Non-A, non-B hepatitis and anti-HCV antibodies in dialysis patients. To define the prevalence of non-A, non-B hepatitis, antibodies to HCV were detected in 193 patients on renal replacement therapy (52 transplant and 141 hemodialysis patients) and in 50 staff members of a Nephrology Department. Unequivocal seroconversion was documented in 5 transplant (9.6%) and in 26 dialysis patients (18.4%). In the dialysis population, the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was evaluated in patients grouped according to the number of blood transfusions and to the different sections of dialytic treatment. The most striking findings were the marked differences in the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies among patients treated in different sections (from 0% to 70%), and the presence of a significant increase in alanine-amino-transferase (ALT) concentrations in 14 anti-HCV negative patients. The results suggest that the diffusion of non-A, non-B hepatitis is mainly transfusion-related, with the possibility of significant environmental diffusion related to the violation of infection-control measures.

"Induction of encephalitis in SJL mice by intranasal infection with herpes simplex virus type 1: a possible model of herpes simplex encephalitis in humans. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is characterized by focal lesions of hemorrhage and necrosis, primarily in the inferior temporal lobe. Since immunosuppressed patients with HSE lack the focal inflammatory changes and temporal lobe localization, it has been suggested that the immune system participates in the pathogenesis of HSE. Evaluation of this hypothesis has been impeded by the lack of an immunologically defined animal model that resembles the human disease. Toward this end, 10 strains of inbred mice were infected intranasally with a neurovirulent clinical isolate of herpes simplex virus type 1. Most mice died without localizing signs of disease in the central nervous system. However, a significant number of SJL mice had a pattern of encephalitis highly reminiscent of that described in humans. To our knowledge, this is the first murine model that faithfully mimics this human disease, and thus it affords the opportunity to study the immunopathogenesis of HSE.",Virus_Diseases
"Specificity, sensitivity and diagnostic predictive value of selected laboratory generated autoantibody profiles in patients with connective tissue diseases. We tested the hypothesis that the application of 5 laboratory generated serologic profiles facilitates the interpretation of individual autoantibodies in connective tissue diseases without loss of specificity, sensitivity or diagnostic predictive value. The predetermined laboratory generated autoantibody profiles were analyzed in 423 sera from patients with clinically diagnosed connective tissue diseases. All sera positive for one or more autoantibodies to a selected panel of nuclear antigens could be segregated into one of 5 profiles. The distribution of individual autoantibodies and profiles in the sera of patients with various connective tissue diseases were compared in terms of their respective diagnostic predictive value and sensitivity. The application of these profiles improved the sensitivity and diagnostic predictive value of these tests when compared to individual autoantibodies without loss of specificity, thus aiding clinical interpretation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A tyrosinase gene missense mutation in temperature-sensitive type I oculocutaneous albinism. A human homologue to the Siamese cat and the Himalayan mouse. Type I oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder in which deficient synthesis of melanin pigment results from abnormal activity of melanocyte tyrosinase. A novel type I OCA phenotype in which hypopigmentation is related to local body temperature is associated with a missense substitution in tyrosinase, codon 422 CGG (Arg)----CAG (Gln). This substitution results in a tyrosinase polypeptide that is temperature-sensitive. This form of type I OCA thus is homologous to the temperature-related forms of albinism seen in the Siamese cat and the Himalayan mouse.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The authors report a case of Carney's complex (the complex of myxomas, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity) in a 32-year-old white man. Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma has recently been included as a component of this disorder. The complex was recognized after a psammomatous melanotic schwannoma was resected from the sacral canal. Subsequent echocardiography revealed ventricular cardiac myxomata. Resection of these lesions was successfully performed.

"Infection of cynomolgus monkeys with HIV-2 protects against pathogenic consequences of a subsequent simian immunodeficiency virus infection. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in cynomolgus macaques leads to severe immunodeficiency with a fatal outcome. In contrast, HIV-2 infects these primates without apparently causing any immunological abnormalities. In this study three cynomolgus monkeys were experimentally infected with HIV-2 strain SBL-K135 and 168 days later challenged with 10-100 animal infectious doses of the closely related SIV strain SM to study protective immunity. At the time of SIV challenge the HIV-2-infected monkeys had neutralizing antibodies against HIV-2, but virus could no longer be recovered from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and no clinical symptoms or decrease in CD4+ lymphocytes were observed. Follow-up for 9 months after challenge with SIV showed that the HIV-2-infected monkeys were protected against SIV-induced immunodeficiency (no decrease of CD4+ lymphocytes) and lymphadenopathy. However, they were not resistant to SIV infection since virus could be recovered from their PBMCs and they developed anamnestic antibody responses. Four naive control monkeys which were inoculated with the same dose of SIV became persistently infected and developed a decrease of the absolute numbers of CD4+ cells and showed a marked lymphadenopathy. Two out of four control animals died 58-265 days postinfection with an immunosuppressive disease. Immunohistochemical examination showed abundant viral antigen in lymph-node biopsies from the SIV-infected control monkeys but absence of SIV or HIV-2 antigens in the biopsies from the three HIV-2-preinfected and SIV-superinfected monkeys. The present study demonstrates possibilities for induction of immunity against immunodeficiency induced by a primate lentivirus, a concept with application also to HIV infection and AIDS in man.",Virus_Diseases
"Mumps outbreak in a highly vaccinated population. From October 1988 to April 1989, a large mumps outbreak occurred in Douglas County, Kansas. Of the 269 cases, 208 (77.3%) occurred among primary and secondary school students, of whom 203 (97.6%) had documentation of mumps vaccination. Attack rates were highest for students attending junior high school (8.0%), followed by high school (2.0%) and elementary school (0.7%). A retrospective cohort study conducted at one junior high school with an attack rate of 12.9% did not find age at vaccination or type of vaccine received (single or combined antigen) to be risk factors for vaccine failure. Students vaccinated more than 4 years before the outbreak appeared to have a higher attack rate than those vaccinated more recently (relative risk (RR) = 4.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6, 30.0); however, this association did not exist when risk was evaluated based on number of vaccine doses received. Students who had documentation of receiving only one dose of vaccine were at greater risk than those who had received two doses (RR = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.0, 206.2). Overall, vaccine effectiveness among Douglas County junior high school students was estimated to be 83% (95% CI = 57%, 94%). These data suggest that mumps vaccine failure and the failure to vaccinate have contributed to the relative resurgence of mumps observed in the United States since 1986. The recent change in immunization policy to recommend a two-dose schedule of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine should help reduce the occurrence of mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations.",Virus_Diseases
"The declining transmission of hepatitis A in Thailand. Hepatitis A antibody was almost universal among Thai children 10-15 years ago. To assess whether transmission of hepatitis A among Thai children had declined, contemporary antibody prevalence and seroconversion rates were determined.

Among 453 low-income urban schoolchildren, there were no seroconversions over a 10- to 12-month period (95% confidence interval [CI] for incidence, 0-0.8%). Antibody prevalence among rural children also declined between 1985 and 1989, though rates were higher than those in Bangkok. Antibody prevalence differed by community. The annual rural infection rate was 1.1% (CI, 0.8%-1.6%). The pattern of rural hepatitis A transmission was focal.

"Cellular localization of interleukin-8 and its inducer, tumor necrosis factor-alpha in psoriasis. The importance of immunologic mechanisms in psoriasis has been deduced from the ability of immunosuppressive therapies to ameliorate this common and chronic skin disease. Certainly the histology of psoriatic lesions suggests a dialogue between the hyperplastic keratinocytes and infiltrating T lymphocytes and macrophages. To begin dissecting the cytokine network involved in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, the location, in both epidermal and dermal compartments, of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and transforming growth factor-alpha at the protein and/or mRNA levels were identified. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was selected as a potentially key regulatory cytokine, first because it induces cultured keratinocyte interleukin-8, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and transforming growth factor-alpha production, and second because intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression by keratinocytes in psoriatic epidermis had been identified previously. Using immunohistochemical localization, tumor necrosis factor-alpha was identified in 12 psoriatic lesions as intense and diffuse expression by dermal dendrocytes (macrophages) in the papillary dermis (without significant staining of endothelial cells, mast cells, or dermal Langerhans cells), and focally by keratinocytes and intraepidermal Langerhans cells. Functional interaction between the dermal dendrocytes and keratinocytes was suggested by the presence of interleukin-8 expression of suprabasal keratinocytes immediately above the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-positive dermal dendrocytes. Interleukin-8 mRNA and transforming growth factor-alpha mRNA were detectable in the epidermal roof of psoriatic lesions, but neither was detectable at the protein or mRNA levels in any normal skin specimens. Treatment of cultured human keratinocytes with phorbol ester (which experimentally produces psoriasiform changes on mouse skin) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha also increased interleukin-8 and transforming growth factor-alpha mRNAs. Further elucidation of the cellular and molecular basis for the genesis and evolution of psoriasis will provide the framework for a better evaluation of the cause and treatment of this skin disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Cultured epidermal autografts and allografts: a study of differentiation and allograft survival. Cultured epidermal sheets were examined before and at various times after grafting on skin ulcer beds. Before grafting, the sheet consisted of four to five layers of keratinocytes with incomplete differentiation. Ten days after grafting, graft recipient sites showed compact hyperkeratosis, a normal-appearing epidermis, and a flat dermoepidermal junction. At 6 months, the stratum corneum had a basket-weave appearance but the dermoepidermal junction remained flat. Monoclonal antibodies to keratins 14 and 10 showed normal basal and suprabasal localization, respectively. Electron microscopy showed a normal basement membrane with anchoring fibrils. LH7:2, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the type VII collagen molecule, stained the dermoepidermal junction in all biopsy specimens. AE-1, an antibody that stains suprabasal cells in hyperproliferative skin, was expressed suprabasally for up to 12 weeks after healing (16 weeks after grafting), but expression was confined to the basal layer at 18 weeks after healing (6 months after grafting). Anti-involucrin staining was found in the deeper layers of the epidermis up to 12 weeks after healing (16 weeks after grafting) but had receded to a normal distribution in upper spinous and granular layers at 18 weeks (6 months after grafting). Overall, the histologic patterns observed in recipient sites during the first 4 months after grafting resembled those observed for 10 to 14 days in newly healed epidermis and in hyperproliferative states such as psoriasis. In four sex-mismatched graft sites, specimens were reacted with a biotinylated probe to the Y chromosome by in situ hybridization. Lack of Y chromosome-positive cells suggested that host keratinocytes had replaced the allografts. Multilocus DNA analysis in one patient confirmed this observation. Our data suggest that an altered state of epithelial maturation persists for several months after culture grafting, with restoration of the normal pattern by 6 months. No differences were detected between autografted and allografted sites.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Biochemical diagnosis of systemic mast cell disorders. Systemic mastocytosis is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of tissue mast cells. Symptoms of mastocytosis are primarily attributed to the release of mast cell mediators during episodes of systemic activation of the excessive numbers of mast cells. Thus, biochemical evidence for the release of increased quantities of mast cell secretory products can suggest or confirm, depending on the clinical situation, a diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis. A major advantage of the biochemical approach to the diagnosis of systemic mast cell disease is that it has allowed the recognition of a class of patients in whom episodes of systemic mastocytes activation can be unequivocally documented biochemically but in whom clear-cut evidence of abnormal mast cell proliferation is lacking by current histologic criteria. Although the release of increased quantities of mast cell mediators can be demonstrated during episodes of mast cell activation in such patients, mediator levels are usually normal at quiescent times. By contrast, patients with proliferative mast cell disease (mastocytosis) usually exhibit chronic overproduction of mast cell mediators. Mast cell secretory products that can be measured in an attempt to obtain biochemical evidence of systemic mast cell activation include histamine, prostaglandin D2, tryptase, and heparin. The analytical approaches to assessing release of those individual mast cell products are evaluated. In general, the diagnosis and investigation of patients with systemic mast cell activation can best be accomplished by concerted use of histologic examination of key tissues together with analysis of chemical markers of the mast cell.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The impact of respiratory viral infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. Respiratory viruses have been implicated in pulmonary exacerbations of CF and in the long-term course of pulmonary dysfunction in these patients. However, the data are by no means complete and there is the clear need for more intensive evaluations of the role of viral pathogens in this population. Further controlled prospective studies assessing the impact of viral infections in large cohorts of patients with CF are still necessary. Placebo-controlled, antiviral treatment protocols also should be initiated. In clinical practice at the present time, patients with CF should be assessed for respiratory viral infections, at least at the time of hospitalizations for pulmonary deterioration. This assessment should include obtaining specimens from the respiratory tract for viral cultures and rapid respiratory viral antigen detection. Identifying a respiratory viral infection may alter clinical care. The patient can be isolated appropriately, and it may be possible to reduce the intensive use of expensive and potentially toxic parenteral antibiotics. The role of antiviral therapy in these patients must await further evaluations. The mechanisms of the short- and long-term effects of respiratory viruses in patients with CF have not been defined. However, pathophysiologic studies conducted in normal children and adults allow the development of several plausible hypotheses. The definition of mechanisms of injury in this population must be a priority, since it may influence clinical practice. If airway obstruction is the principal mechanism of viral-induced injury, therapeutic approaches designed to relieve the obstruction would be most appropriate. For example, if the obstruction resulted from induced or aggravated reactive airway disease, the current common practice of prescribing chronic bronchodilator therapy would be appropriate. This therapy might be especially suited to those experiencing frequent viral infections. In addition, the administration of bronchodilators to patients during acute exacerbations of pulmonary disease caused by viruses might be of clinical benefit. If, on the other hand, the principal mechanism of viral-induced injury is found to be through synergistic interaction with bacteria, the current practice of aggressive antimicrobial therapy would remain appropriate.",Virus_Diseases

To evaluate the occurrence of infections in asymptomatic and symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children we performed a prospective comparative cohort study. Twenty-seven HIV-infected children were individually matched with paired immunocompetent controls and followed up for a total of 543 months (mean per child, 19.4 +/- 11 months). Collected data were evaluated considering HIV-infected children both as a whole and as P1 and P2 patients according to the Centers for Disease Control classification. Twenty-seven HIV-infected children had 185 infectious episodes vs. 27 matched controls who experienced 118 infections. P1 children had a number of infections similar to those of normal controls (99 vs. 86) whereas P2 children had a significantly higher number of infections than did controls (86 vs. 32). Pneumonia and oral candidiasis occurred significantly more frequently in symptomatic HIV-infected children than in normal controls. Severe infections occurred almost exclusively in HIV-infected symptomatic children.",Virus_Diseases
"Spontaneous splenic rupture following infectious mononucleosis. Four cases of spontaneous splenic rupture after infectious mononucleosis (IM) have been treated at this institution since 1978. The condition is rare, occurring in 0.1-0.5 per cent of patients with proven infectious mononucleosis. Splenectomy is considered the treatment of choice for these patients. However, because recent trends in the management of traumatic splenic rupture are moving towards nonoperative treatment with selected patients, a similar approach has been considered for the patient with spontaneous splenic rupture following IM. The major reason for avoiding splenectomy is the increased incidence of sepsis in splenectomized patients. Yet, splenic rupture is accompanied by hemorrhage and the risks associated with blood transfusion for ongoing hemorrhage are of similar magnitude as those of sepsis following splenectomy. In addition, the grossly abnormal spleens seen at operation tend to include large, contained hematomas that may also be prone to rupture. Therefore, operative management still appears to be the preferred treatment for spontaneous splenic rupture following IM. Splenectomy is curative, safe, and obviates the need for transfusion, extended hospitalization, and activity restriction.",Virus_Diseases
"Estrogen receptor localization in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix. To investigate the estrogen receptor (ER) status of cells during carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix, the immunohistochemical reactivity for a monoclonal anti-ER antibody (H 222) was studied in 26 normal cervical specimens, 21 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and 21 cases of invasive cervical carcinoma. In addition, the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA (types 6/11, 16/18, or 31/33/35) was analyzed by in situ hybridization. In the normal cervix, basal cells of the squamous epithelium, metaplastic cells, and endocervical glandular cells were ER positive. In contrast, neoplastic cells of CIN (17 of 21 cases) and invasive carcinoma (19 of 21 cases) were ER negative. The remaining four cases of CIN and two cases of invasive carcinoma were focally ER positive. The HPV DNA analysis revealed that HPV DNA in ER-negative cases was either types 16/18 or undetectable, but all ER-positive neoplasms contained HPV DNA types 31/33/35. These results suggest that most neoplastic cells in CIN and invasive cervical carcinoma lose their ER expression and that this may be related to the HPV DNA types which they possess.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Methylsulphasalazine in rheumatoid arthritis. Methylsulphasalazine, which differs from sulphasalazine by the addition of one methyl group, may provide the benefits of the parent drug with fewer side-effects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We describe the outcome of its use in RA. Of 21 patients entered into the study, 10 successfully completed 6 months of therapy; five developed adverse effects, four withdrew for reasons unrelated to drug treatment and two stopped because of inefficacy. No serious adverse effects were reported. A statistically significant improvement in most clinical assessments was observed from weeks 8-12 onwards. Significant improvement in plasma viscosity was observed and there was a trend towards improvement in serum CRP, histidine and IgM concentrations. There was a good correlation between mean serial changes in clinical and biochemical assessments indicating that the drug may exhibit the properties of a second-line agent. Median steady-state serum concentrations of methylsulphasalazine and methylsulphapyridine were 26.6 micrograms/ml and 2.85 micrograms/ml respectively.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Articular disease severity in rheumatoid subjects with and without Felty's syndrome. Articular disease severity as measured by a radiographic score of hands and feet was compared in rheumatoid subjects with (21) and without (170) Felty's syndrome. Disease duration was a major determinant of joint destruction. When this was taken into consideration radiographic scores were no higher in the Felty's group than in rheumatoid subjects without Felty's syndrome. Immunogenetic associations previously described in Felty's syndrome are unlikely therefore to represent non-specific markers of disease severity and more likely to represent markers of extra-articular disease.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The clinical and health status of patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis. This study was designed to document the clinical and health status of patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Three groups were studied: 108 patients who had had RA for greater than 1 year (established RA group), 313 patients who had had RA for less than or equal to 1 year (recent-onset RA group), and 188 healthy friend of the patients with recent-onset RA (no RA group). Clinical status was measured using tender joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and overall physician assessment. Health status was measured using the physical, psychological, pain, and arthritis impact scores of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales. Scores on all clinical and health status measures indicated substantial disease effects in the group with recent-onset RA. For most of these measures, effect size analysis indicated that clinical and health status impacts in the recent-onset RA group were similar in magnitude to those found in the groups with more established disease, with scores in both groups being substantially different from those found in the no RA group. These results document the magnitude of the clinical and health status impacts in recent-onset RA. They lend support to recent arguments advocating aggressive therapy earlier in the course of this frequently disabling disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Somatosensory and magnetic evoked potentials in a postoperative paraparetic patient: case report. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) testing is increasingly being used to test for spinal cord injuries and to monitor spinal surgery to reduce the risk of paraplegia. It is a sensory test, but it is assumed that any process severe enough to affect the motor tracts will also affect the sensory tracts and, therefore, be identified. Increasingly, however, isolated motor-tract involvement has been reported. A new technique, magnetic coil stimulation of the cortex, directly monitors the motor tracts. We report a case where the SSEP was normal although the magnetic motor-evoked potential was abnormal, supporting the hypothesis that direct testing of motor tracts may be advantageous.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Mechanisms of action of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and potential use in autoimmune connective tissue diseases. It has been almost 10 years since the observations on the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Over the next decade, IVIG was used in other types of autoimmune diseases. Much work has also been done on gaining a better understanding of the mechanism(s) by which IVIG exerts its effects in these autoimmune diseases. This review examines the proposed mechanisms of action of IVIG and establishes a rationale for the use of this type of therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune connective tissue disorders. Currently, only anecdotal reports are available on the treatment of SLE with IVIG. Nevertheless, studies thus far suggest that IVIG may be useful in selected SLE patients with cytopenias and cutaneous vasculitis and may have a steroid-sparing effect in patients with SLE and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In SLE patients with renal disease, it should be used cautiously because some patients have worsening of their renal function with IVIG infusions. These preliminary experiences suggest that multicenter controlled trials on the therapeutic use of IVIG in SLE and other connective tissue disorders would be important.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Peptide containing nerves in human synovium: immunohistochemical evidence for decreased innervation in rheumatoid arthritis. The innervation of normal and rheumatoid human synovium was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibodies against the general neuronal marker protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 and specific neuropeptides were used. We observed sensory nerves containing substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) as well as autonomic sympathetic fibers immunoreactive for neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY), its C terminal peptide (C-PON) and the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Three subpopulations of nerve fibers labelled with SP and CGRP were identified: some stained for SP or CGRP only and others contained both peptides. NPY/C-PON and TH labelled predominantly perivascular nerves. Quantification of immunostained nerves revealed a significantly decreased innervation of rheumatoid synovia. The densities of both PGP 9.5 and neuropeptide containing nerves were lower in all rheumatoid samples. Our results are compatible with a local release of neuropeptides into joint fluid and point to a disturbed neuronal control of rheumatoid synovial tissue.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Interleukin-1 in human skin: dysregulation in psoriasis. Cytokine dysregulation is an attractive concept to explain many of the observed abnormalities in psoriasis. IL-1, in particular, can potentiate immune cellular activation, activate fibroblasts, and increase endothelial cell adhesiveness to leukocytes. Here, we review IL-1 regulation in normal and psoriatic skin in vivo in relation to normal skin and cultured keratinocytes. Contrary to expectations, IL-1 functional activity in psoriatic lesions is reduced, not increased, relative to normal skin. The reduction is attributable to the presence of IL-1 inhibitors, reduced IL-1 alpha levels, and an IL-1 beta that lacked function in T-cell assays. IL-1 beta protein is actually significantly increased in psoriatic lesions, but the mechanism of its non-functionality remains unclear. Unlike cultured keratinocytes, which accumulate large, inactive IL-1 beta precursors, both normal and psoriatic skin process IL-1 beta to a mature form. Novel mechanisms of post-translational processing by epidermis in vivo may generate a novel form of IL-1 beta with unknown functions. The marked abnormalities of IL-1 regulation in psoriatic skin suggest that this molecule may be important in normal skin homeostasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Differential synthesis of 5-lipoxygenase in peripheral blood and synovial fluid neutrophils in rheumatoid arthritis. In order to investigate 5-lipoxygenase enzyme regulation in neutrophils during an inflammatory reaction, we studied 5-lipoxygenase mRNA levels, as well as de novo enzyme synthesis, in resting and activated neutrophils isolated from normal individuals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The approach used was to analyze these activities in resting peripheral blood neutrophils of normal individuals on the one hand and in peripheral blood and matched synovial fluid neutrophils isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis on the other hand. Our first observation was that resting peripheral blood neutrophils of either normal individuals or patients show detectable levels of 5-lipoxygenase mRNA and are able to synthesize the enzyme de novo. Our second observation was that inflammatory activated neutrophils from synovial fluid reveal lower 5-lipoxygenase mRNA levels and enzyme synthesis than do the patient-matched peripheral blood cells. This is in spite of the fact that, for other proteins, synovial fluid neutrophils are equally or more active than their peripheral blood counterparts. We conclude that peripheral blood neutrophils are capable of synthesizing the enzyme, thus ensuring the turnover of the protein. Furthermore, complex regulatory mechanisms appear to take place in response to inflammation as it occurs in synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, leading to decreased mRNA levels and enzyme synthesis. Possible mechanisms of regulation are discussed and are presently under investigation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Studies on the transmission of viral disease via the CO2 laser plume and ejecta. While recent reports have noted the presence of viral DNA sequences in the laser plume, no significant effort has been made to study transmission of the virus in vivo via airborne laser debris. Studies were undertaken to identify potential hazards to operating room occupants in gynecologic laser surgery. ACO2 laser in the continuous wave mode using a power density of 666 W/cm2 was fired through a 5-cm metal cylinder at virus-infected tissues. Airborne particulate debris, 100-200 microns, was removed from the cylinder's inner surfaces. In one instance, deposition of the debris was found on the surgeon's eyeglasses 1 m from the site of impact despite the use of a smoke evacuator. The first set of studies involved confirmed human papillomavirus (HPV) lesions of the human female lower genital tract. Specimens were collected for electron microscopy and Southern Blot viral hybridization. Additional cervical electron microscopy specimens were recovered from the speculum during pulsed CO2 laser treatment at 13 W average power during conization. Electron microscopy of the vulvar debris revealed only anucleate keratinized squamous epithelial cells. Cervical specimens demonstrated similar cells with nearly instantaneous vaporization of intracellular water and apparent condensation of cellular carbon. HPV Southern Blot testing revealed insufficient quantities of DNA for that technique. The second set of studies involved bovine papillomavirus lesions from dairy cattle. The debris was transmitted to susceptible animals. The bovine studies failed to demonstrate the transmission of disease in vivo.",Virus_Diseases
"Topical silicone gel for the prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scar. We studied the effects of a silicone gel bandage that was worn for at least 12 hours daily on the resolution of hypertrophic burn scar. In a second cohort, the prevention of hypertrophic scar formation in fresh surgical incisions by this bandage was also evaluated. In 19 patients with hypertrophic burn scars, elasticity of the scars was quantitated serially with the use of an elastometer. An adjacent or mirror-image hypertrophic burn scar served as a control. Scar elasticity was increased after both 1 and 2 months compared with that in controls. There was corresponding improvement clinically that persisted for at least 6 months. In the other cohort, scar volume changes in 21 surgical incisions were measured before and after 1 and 2 months. Gel-treated incisions gained less volume than control incisions after both intervals. Clinical assessment corroborated this quantitative demonstration of a decrement in scar volume. We concluded that topical silicone gel is efficacious, both in the prevention and in the treatment of hypertrophic scar.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Neutralizing antibodies to interferon-alpha: relative frequency in patients treated with different interferon preparations. The frequencies of antibody development so far reported in patients treated with different interferons (IFNs) are not readily comparable because of differences in treatment regimens and assay methods. Thus the frequency of neutralizing antibody development was analyzed in a large sample of sera derived from a relatively homogeneous group of patients treated with different IFN-alpha preparations. The frequency of developing neutralizing antibody to IFN varied according to the IFN given. Particularly, the seroconversion frequency was significantly higher in patients treated with recombinant IFN-alpha 2a (20.2%) than in patients treated with either recombinant IFN-alpha 2b (6.9%) or IFN-alpha N1 (1.2%), a lymphoblastoid IFN-alpha. Furthermore, sera obtained from patients treated with either recombinant IFN neutralized both types of recombinant IFNs but failed to neutralize IFN-alpha N1.",Virus_Diseases

Patients with Herpes simplex encephalitis often are considered to be poor rehabilitation candidates because of their multiple deficits and grave prognosis. This report presents case reports on three patients with biopsy-proven Herpes simplex encephalitis, all of whom were treated with acyclovir in acute care and then admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation program. All had multiple brain lesions with minimal motor findings but cognitive and communication deficits.

The other two made useful functional gains and were discharged home in two weeks and 10 weeks, suggesting that a trial of rehabilitation may be warranted after Herpes simplex encephalitis.",Virus_Diseases
"A coproporphyria-like syndrome induced by glipizide. A 49-year-old man with a 1-month history of episodic, severe abdominal pain sought medical attention. The patient's history was remarkable for type II diabetes, for which glipizide therapy had been initiated 2 months earlier. No other medications were being taken at the time the paroxysms of pain began. During the episodes of pain, both examination of the abdomen and abdominal roentgenograms revealed normal findings. Initial assessment, including ultrasonography and computed tomographic scanning of the abdomen, upper gastrointestinal and colon roentgenograms, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, revealed no cause of the pain. Empiric trials of famotidine, sucralfate, and antacids failed to relieve the pain. Both urine and fecal specimens collected after an attack demonstrated substantially increased coproporphyrins. The glipizide regimen was discontinued; 2 months later, the stool coproporphyrins had decreased to normal levels. At follow-up more than 1 year later, the patient had had no recurrence of abdominal pain. Although other orally administered hypoglycemic agents and other sulfa compounds have been reported to precipitate acute attacks of porphyria, to our knowledge this is the first such case associated with glipizide. We suggest that glipizide be added to the list of medications to be avoided in patients with porphyria.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Therapeutic use of cytokines in dermatology. Cytokines are glycoproteins produced by many different cells. Via binding to specific receptors on target cells they regulate the activation, differentiation, and proliferation of immune and nonimmune cells. After injury keratinocytes synthesize and release cytokines such as interleukins, colony stimulating factors, and growth factors. In addition, a network of interacting cytokines appears to be crucial to maintain proper balance. Dysregulation may contribute to certain diseases, particularly those of infectious and autoimmune origin. Therefore many of these mediators appear to be promising candidates to treat infectious and malignant diseases. This article briefly discusses the most important cytokines. Newly developed regimens with cytokines to treat cutaneous disorders will be reviewed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

A double-blind controlled study was performed on a patient with long-standing yellow nail syndrome to investigate the potential beneficial role of topical vitamin E solution for the nail changes seen in this disorder. Three nails received active solution containing DL-alpha-tocopherol in dimethyl sulfoxide; three nails received dimethyl sulfoxide only; and the remainder were untreated. After 6 months of therapy, the three nails treated with active solution showed marked clinical improvement and a corresponding increase in nail growth rates. Dimethyl sulfoxide alone produced a small increase in nail growth rate and slight clinical improvement. Active solution was then applied to all of the nails for a further 6 months, resulting in clinical improvement and increased nail growth rates in the remaining nails.

"Isolation of dengue virus with a human promonocyte cell line. In October-November, 1988 there was an outbreak of dengue fever in the Kaoshiung area of southern Taiwan. We collected 100 serum samples from 96 patients at the onset of their fever for virus cultures and identification. A human promonocyte cell line (HL-CZ) established in our laboratory was used and proved to be susceptible for dengue virus propagation. Type 1 dengue virus in the HL-CZ cell culture was identified by immunofluorescence tests using monoclonal antibodies, and also by hemagglutination tests with goose red blood cells. The density of the virus particles, as measured by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, ranged from 1.186 to 1.224 g/ml. The virus yield from this cell culture is comparable with that from the C6/36 mosquito cell line.

"Bullous pemphigoid antigen: cDNA cloning, cellular expression, and evidence for polymorphism of the human gene. A human epidermal keratinocyte lambda gt11 recombinant cDNA library was screened with a 0.45-kb cDNA that was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a segment of human bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen mRNA. The screen yielded five clones, the largest one, pcBPA-4, being 2.3 kb in size. The pcBPA-4 cDNA hybridized in Northern analyses with an approximately 9-kb mRNA from cultured keratinocytes, whereas no hybridization signal was detected with RNA from human skin fibroblast, fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells, or amniotic epithelial WISH cell cultures. Nucleotide sequencing of pcBPA-4 revealed an open reading frame encoding a putative polypeptide of 447 amino acids. This polypeptide showed 88% homology with corresponding mouse BP antigen sequences, and a region of it was identical to a segment in previously published human BP antigen sequences. The 2.3-kb cDNA isolated here was different from a previously published human BP antigen cDNA, in that the open reading frame coded for 264 additional amino acids at the carboxyl end of the putative polypeptide. Known human BP antigen amino acid sequences, compared with mouse sequences, were predicted to be moderately divergent with a unit of evolutionary period (UEP) of 4.5 millions of years (MY). Southern hybridizations suggested that the BP antigen gene (BPAG1) is present as a single copy in the human genome. Southern analyses also revealed the presence of a StuI restriction fragment length polymorphism that can be used for linkage analyses to study the inheritance of a particular BPAG1 allele and a heritable cutaneous disorder affecting the basement membrane zone, such as epidermolysis bullosa.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Suppressed serum erythropoietin response to anemia and the efficacy of recombinant erythropoietin in the anemia of rheumatoid arthritis. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) was measured by radioimmunoassay in 67 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Twenty of these patients judged to have iron deficiency anemia, based on reduced serum ferritin levels, had higher serum EPO levels than did the 24 other anemic patients with normal or elevated serum ferritin levels. A significant negative correlation between serum EPO and hemoglobin concentrations was noted in the former group, but not in the latter. Human recombinant erythropoietin (r-EPO) was administered to 6 anemic patients with RA, resulting in improvement of anemia in 4 patients, 2 of whom showed no change in RA activity.

"Application of beta-interferon in virus-induced papillomas. Eighty patients with bilateral common warts of the extremities were treated at weekly intervals with intralesional injections of either human fibroblast interferon or placebo. Lyophilized interferon (3 X 10(6) units) was diluted with 3 ml of normal sterile saline matched with identical vials of placebo. Eighty sets of three vials of human fibroblast interferon or placebo were labeled either A or B by a controller who maintained the code until the experiment was completed. Each patient received 0.1 X 10(6) units of interferon into the warts on one side and placebo injections into those on the matching extremity. Warts were measured each week and the progress or lack thereof was scored on a scale of -1 (worse) to 3 (cured). Therapy continued until either at least one extremity had cleared or the patient had received 10 weekly injections. A final evaluation was scored by measuring the total progress of each patient during the study. Sixty-four patients were treated to completion. More than 81% of the interferon-treated extremities were either cured or responded effectively to therapy. Only 17% of the placebo-treated lesions responded in this fashion. A statistical analysis of these data confirms the effectiveness of intralesional interferon therapy. The average number of interferon injections until cure was 5.9 +/- 1.7. No adverse effects were observed. The applications of interferon in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis and flat warts were also studied. Intralesional interferon beta was, to a certain degree, effective for benign lesions of epidermodysplasia verruciformis, but systemic treatments were not effective.

"Eosinophilic fasciitis is clinically distinguishable from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and is not associated with L-tryptophan use. Induration of the skin develops in a majority of patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan, and bears striking clinical and histopathological resemblance to eosinophilic fasciitis (EF). These similarities have led to the suggestion that eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and EF are the same disease. To study the relationship of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and EF, we ascertained the prevalence of L-tryptophan use in a cohort of patients with EF, and compared their clinical and laboratory findings to those of patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated cutaneous involvement. None of 11 patients who were diagnosed as having EF between 1970 and 1989 used L-tryptophan containing preparations prior to the onset of their illness. Marked clinical and laboratory test differences were observed between patients with EF and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome had a more acute onset, more severe symptoms, higher frequency of rash and of pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, neurologic, myopathic and thyroid involvement compared to patients with EF. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in improvement of cutaneous involvement in 88% of patients with EF but it was only partially successful in patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Hospitalization and fatalities occurred only among patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. These observations demonstrate that eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a more severe disease with multisystemic involvement that can be clinically distinguished from EF. In contrast to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, EF is not associated with L-tryptophan ingestion.",Virus_Diseases
"Macrophage-tropic variants of SIV are associated with specific AIDS-related lesions but are not essential for the development of AIDS. The importance of macrophage infection for the development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was investigated. Molecularly cloned simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)mac239 replicates very poorly in cultured macrophages yet it causes AIDS in rhesus monkeys. Three of five rhesus monkeys that died with AIDS following SIVmac239 infection showed no disease manifestations directly associated with macrophage infection, such as encephalitis and granulomatous interstitial pneumonia. Simian immunodeficiency virus recovered from the peripheral blood of these three animals at or near the time of death replicated very poorly if at all in cultured macrophages, and tissues taken at autopsy showed little or no infection of macrophages by immunohistochemical staining. However two of the five rhesus monkeys that died with AIDS following SIVmac239 infection displayed a characteristic SIV-related meningoencephalitis and/or granulomatous pneumonia, lesions associated with macrophage infection. Simian immunodeficiency virus recovered from the peripheral blood of these two animals near the time of death replicated extremely well in cultured macrophages, indicating the emergency of macrophage-tropic variants in vivo. Furthermore tissues taken at autopsy from these two showed many infected macrophages by immunohistochemical staining. These results indicate that AIDS and death can occur without obvious involvement of macrophage infection. However the presence of macrophage-tropic viral strains appears to influence the disease course and disease manifestations.",Virus_Diseases

"Quantitative assessment of the age of fibrotic lesions using polarized light microscopy and digital image analysis. Reliable histologic methods for gauging the maturity of fibrotic lesions are limited, making interventions in the healing process difficult to assess. As collagen ages there is enhanced birefringence due to increased molecular and fibrillar organization. The purpose of this study was to develop a microscopal technique to quantify this process and to determine its ability to distinguish scars of varying ages. Fibrosis in the rat gracilis muscle was studied 5 to 63 days after superficial injury. Sections were stained with picrosirius red and illuminated with monochromatic, polarized light. The microscope fields were digitized using a computer-video system yielding an image in which noncollagenous material was dark (gray level 0) and collagen was depicted by grey levels 1 to 255. In the fibrosis model used, the collagen area fraction plateaued at 80% by day 21. The median collagen grey level increased progressively as the scar aged. It is concluded that this histologic, nondestructive technique can reliably quantify age-related optical properties of fibrotic collagen and that this could be used to determine the maturity of fibrotic lesions.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Medical and laboratory aspects. The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is largely dependent on the existence of a characteristic pattern of clinical symptoms and signs that must be present for at least six weeks. Early morning joint stiffness and symmetric polyarticular inflammation, particularly in the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, wrist, and metatarsophalangeal joints, are typical of the disease. Extraarticular disease, including rheumatoid nodules, is usually associated with severe and well-established arthritis, and occular, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, and vasculitic involvement can be a considerable source of morbidity. Serologic testing for rheumatoid factor (RF) is helpful in confirming the diagnosis since 80% of patients are seropositive, but RFs are expressed in many other disease states. Expression of multiple RF isotypes differentiates RA from other populations. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein levels, circulating immune complexes, and platelet counts are often elevated in RA and serve as indicators of disease activity.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Molecular analysis of IgM rheumatoid factor binding to chimeric IgG. To localize regions on IgG bound by rheumatoid factors (RF), we studied IgM RF binding to chimeric IgG antibodies consisting of murine V regions fused to human constant regions. Using a modified RF ELISA, we showed that polyclonal RF from rheumatoid arthritis patients bound IgG1, 2, and 4 strongly; IgG3 was also bound, although less well. The majority of 18 monoclonal RF from patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia bound IgG1, 2, and 4 only. In contrast to RF from RA, 14 of 18 monoclonal RF did not react with IgG3. Only 3 of 18 monoclonal RF bound IgG3 well. By shuffling C region domains between IgG3 and IgG4, we showed that sequence variation in the CH3 domain is responsible for the differential binding of monoclonal RF to IgG3 and IgG4. Hybrid IgG3/IgG4 antibodies containing the CH3 domain of IgG4 were bound by monoclonal RF, whereas those containing the CH3 domain of IgG3 were not. To evaluate the contribution of the N-linked carbohydrate moiety at Asn-297 to RF binding sites on IgG, we measured RF binding to aglycosylated IgG antibodies produced by mutating Asn-297 to another amino acid. Glycosylated and aglycosylated IgG1, 2, and 4 were bound identically by monoclonal and polyclonal RF. Aglycosylated IgG3, however, was bound better than glycosylated IgG3 by polyclonal RF and by IgG3-reactive monoclonal RF.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Allergic contact dermatitis to two antioxidants in latex gloves: 4,4'-thiobis(6-tert-butyl-meta-cresol) (Lowinox 44S36) and butylhydroxyanisole. Allergen alternatives for glove-allergic patients. Allergic contact dermatitis developed on the hands and/or face of two patients after exposure to latex examination gloves. Both patients were patch test negative to the usual rubber allergens, but both had a positive patch test reaction to 4,4'-thiobis(6-tert-butyl-m-cresol) (Lowinox 44S36). Patient 2 was also patch test positive to butylhydroxyanisole. The patients were tested with other gloves, to find gloves that they could safely use. Glove manufacturers were queried to ascertain the occurrence of Lowinox 44S36 and butylhydroxyanisole in different brands of latex and vinyl examination gloves. A list of gloves and their associated allergens was generated and is provided to assist dermatologists in helping patients choose gloves free of specific allergens.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Malignant lymphomas in cynomolgus monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus. Malignant lymphomas were observed in 38% (9 of 24) of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) 5 to 15 months after inoculation with SIV strain SMM3. Lymphomagenesis in the SIV-infected monkeys was not related directly to the SIV-infectious dose given. All SIV-infected animals developed severe immunodeficiency. No significant difference in immunodeficiency was observed between tumor-bearing and non-tumor-bearing animals. In contrast, no lymphomas were observed in a comparable group of HIV-2-infected monkeys, which did not develop immunodeficiency; nor did the noninfected control monkeys. All 9 SIV-related tumors were high-grade B-cell lymphoblastic or pleomorphic lymphomas with extranodal, disseminated growth. Most tumors showed marked infiltration by monocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Occasional tumor infiltrating cells showed immunohistochemical reaction for SIV. The cells of two tumors were established in vitro and shown to be of B-cell phenotype. The tumor cell cultures showed no reverse transcriptase activity and no evidence of virus infection by electron microscopy. Our observations indicate that SIV-induced immunodeficiency in cynomolgus monkeys also mimics HIV infection and AIDS in humans with regard to increased lymphomagenesis and type of lymphomas.",Virus_Diseases
"Immunoblot assay as an aid to the diagnoses of unclassified cases of pemphigus. With use of an immunoblot assay for both the normal human epidermal extracts and the bovine desmosome preparation, we investigated sera from 18 patients with pemphigus, who exhibited atypical clinical or histologic features and whose diagnoses were difficult to identify. Four sera yielded a 130-kd protein band in the epidermal extracts, which is characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris. A 150-kd protein was identified by nine sera in the epidermal extracts and/or the desmosome preparation, which is known as a pemphigus foliaceus antigen. Five sera demonstrated neither antigen. These results suggest that the immunoblot technique is useful to distinguish pemphigus vulgaris from pemphigus foliaceus and can be a good tool for the diagnosis of pemphigus, especially unclassified cases.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Human type VII collagen: genetic linkage of the gene (COL7A1) on chromosome 3 to dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a heterogeneous group of heritable blistering disorders affecting the skin and the mucous membranes. Previous ultrastructural studies on the dystrophic (scarring) forms of EB have demonstrated abnormalities in the anchoring fibrils, morphologically distinct structures below the basal lamina at the dermal/epidermal basement membrane zone. Type VII collagen is the major collagenous component of the anchoring fibrils, and it is therefore a candidate gene for mutations in some families with dystrophic forms of EB. In this study, we performed genetic linkage analyses in a large kindred with dominant dystrophic EB. A 1.9-kb type VII collagen cDNA clone was used to identify a PvuII RFLP to follow the inheritance of the gene. This RFLP cosegregated with the EB phenotype in this family, strongly supporting genetic linkage (Z = 5.37; theta = .0). In addition, we assigned the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) to chromosome 3 by hybridization to a panel of human x rodent somatic cell hybrids. These data demonstrate very close genetic linkage between the clinical phenotype in this family and the polymorphism in the type VII collagen gene mapped to chromosome 3. The absence of recombination between EB and the type VII collagen gene locus, as well as the observed abnormalities in the anchoring fibrils, strongly suggest that this collagen gene is the mutant locus in this kindred.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

A 43-year-old man with xeroderma pigmentosum, XP97TO, was allocated to complementation group D. He had had moderate photosensitivity at age 1 year and freckles by age 6 but no neurologic abnormalities. Nevertheless, his fibroblasts in culture had the XP-D phenotype. They showed a sevenfold hypersensitivity to killing by 254 nm ultraviolet radiation and a diminished level (29%) of unscheduled DNA synthesis. Phototesting revealed delayed maximum erythema at 72 hours after UVB exposure and a lowered minimal erythema dose. Lentigo maligna developed on the patient's face, and a rapidly growing malignant schwannoma was found on the left trigeminal nerve.

"CD8+ cell anti-HIV activity correlates with the clinical state of the infected individual. The extent of antiviral activity exhibited in vitro by CD8+lymphocytes from individuals infected by HIV-1 correlates significantly with their clinical status. CD8+ lymphocytes from asymptomatic subjects were found to inhibit HIV-1 replication by 90% or greater at effector/target (E/T) ratios ranging from as low as 0.05 to 0.25. CD8+ cells from 17 of 19 (89%) of these subjects suppressed replication at an E/T ratio of 0.10 or less. CD8+ lymphocytes from symptomatic patients (non-AIDS) inhibited HIV-1 replication at E/T ratios ranging from 0.05 to 1.0, and CD8+ cells from 8 of 13 (62%) required ratios greater than 0.10. As a group, patients with AIDS exhibited the lowest degree of anti-HIV activity with their CD8+ lymphocytes. The effective range of E/T ratios from AIDS patients was 0.10-2.0, and 9 of 10 (90%) required E/T ratios greater than 0.25. This anti-HIV activity exhibited by CD8+ cells also correlated significantly with the subject's peripheral blood CD4+ cell count. The relative extent of CD8+ cell anti-HIV-1 activity was not found dependent on variations in the CD4+ target cells and viruses used. These findings suggest that the decreased CD8+ cell antiviral activity is related to progression to disease in HIV-infected individuals.",Virus_Diseases

International Registry of Seroconverters [published erratum appears in AIDS 1991 Feb;5(2):245] This study compares AIDS incubation in different geographic areas, calendar time of infection, exposure group and age at exposure. Investigators from North America, Europe and Australia contributed data from 1891 people for whom dates of HIV seroconversion were known. We excluded subjects not enrolled in prospective studies at entry and those with more than 25 months between last negative and first positive sera; we also censored subjects at the time last seen and excluded all follow-up after 1987 in order to minimize the impact of newly developed prophylactic therapies. The final analysis cohort contained 1171 subjects. Using actuarial methods, no differences in incubation times were found among homosexual men infected in different continents or in different years (prior to and after 1 January 1985). Among hemophilic people, children developed AIDS more slowly than adults (P = 0.02), and hemophilic adults developed AIDS more slowly than homosexual men (P less than 0.05), mainly because homosexual men had an added risk of Kaposi's sarcoma. Progression time to AIDS was significantly faster in older hemophilic men, but not in older homosexual men. These data illustrate that AIDS incubation may differ in different exposure groups, probably because of different exposures to potential opportunistic pathogens.",Virus_Diseases

"N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids, a class of antiinflammatory agents with a different mechanism of action [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Mar 15;88(6):2612] Several members of a series of N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids were found to possess a broad spectrum of antiinflammatory activity. The compounds were active against oxazolone dermatitis in mice and adjuvant arthritis in rats, models in which activated T lymphocytes are implicated. The compounds also inhibited T-lymphocyte activation in vitro, assessed by using the mixed lymphocyte reaction. The compounds inhibited the reversed passive Arthus reaction in rats and arachidonic acid-induced dermatitis in mice, models in which leukocyte infiltration is responsible for the inflammatory reaction. More complete evaluation was made of one compound, N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl)leucine (NPC 15199). On histologic examination after arachidonic acid administration, NPC 15199 was found to block recruitment of neutrophils into the inflammatory site. The compound was not a general myelotoxin. Prolonged treatment of animals did not alter bone-marrow progenitor number or the numbers of circulating white blood cells. Further, several white cell functions were not inhibited in vitro, including neutrophil respiratory burst and macrophage phagocytosis. NPC 15199 was effective in blocking antigen arthritis in rabbits and was effective in a therapeutic protocol, reversing oxazolone edema.

"Predictive factors for hand eczema. Factors related to hand eczema were studied. Their relative importance as predictors was ranked by multiple logistic regression analysis. Questionnaires were sent to 20,000 individuals aged 20-65 years, randomly selected from the population register. Those subjects (1385) considering themselves to have had hand eczema within the previous 12 months were invited to a dermatological examination. It was found that a history of childhood eczema was the most important predictive factor for hand eczema. Second was female sex, followed by occupational exposure, a history of asthma and/or hay fever, and a service occupation. A small decrease in risk with advancing age was also found. The difference in the probability of having had eczema in a 1-year period, between individuals having the most important risk factors studied and those having none of them, proved to be for females 48% compared to 8%, and for males 34% compared to 4%. A history of childhood eczema was found to be more common among young persons, indicating an increase in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis.

"Atlantoaxial stabilization in rheumatoid arthritis. Atlantoaxial subluxation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is common. Operative stabilization is clearly indicated when signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression occur. However, many recommend early operative fusion before evidence of appreciable neural compression occurs because 1) the myelopathy in these patients may be irreversible; 2) the overall prognosis is poor once symptoms of cord compression are present; and 3) the risk of sudden death associated with atlantoaxial subluxation is increased even in asymptomatic patients. The authors believe that rheumatoid arthritis patients in relatively good health without advanced multisystem disease and less than 65 years of age should be considered for operative stabilization if mobile atlantoaxial subluxation is greater than 6 mm. Seventeen patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis and atlantoaxial subluxation treated with a posterior arthrodesis are presented. A new method of fusion, devised by the senior author (V.K.H.S.), was utilized in all cases. Indications for operative therapy in these patients included evidence of spinal cord compression in 11 patients (65%) and mobile atlantoaxial subluxation greater than 6 mm but no signs or symptoms of cord compression in six patients (35%). Thirteen patients developed a stable osseous fusion, two patients a well-aligned fibrous union, one patient a malaligned fibrous union, and one patient died prior to evaluation of fusion stability. The details of the operative technique and management strategies are presented. Several technical advantages of this method of fusion make this approach particularly useful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Because of multisystem involvement of this disease, a high rate of osseous fusion is often difficult to achieve.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"AIDS awareness among rural Utah physicians. Studies of physicians' attitudes and knowledge of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the clinical precautions they take against exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have focused on urban physicians. To determine rural physicians' knowledge and attitudes about AIDS, a questionnaire was mailed to 321 physicians practicing in rural Utah. Of the 169 physicians who completed questionnaires, 96% thought that their community or area of service had only a minor or no problem with AIDS; 89%, however, thought that their chance of seeing a patient who was HIV-positive was fair to moderate. Of the 169 respondents, 3% were not sure whether they would even treat a patient who had AIDS, 67% said they would, and 30% said they would not. Although all physicians are at risk of seeing a patient who has had exposure to HIV and other blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis B, only 55% of the respondents felt a need to take clinical precautions to prevent their exposure to the virus.

"Increased phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol content in psoriatic involved compared to uninvolved and normal epidermis. Evidence suggests that the phospholipase C/protein kinase C signal transduction system participates in the regulation of epidermal cell growth and differentiation. Psoriatic epidermis is characterized by hyperproliferation, defective differentiation, and inflammation. In this report, we have determined the activity of phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and 1,2-diacylglycerol content in normal and psoriatic involved and uninvolved epidermis. 1,2-diacylglycerol is formed from phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2 and is the physiologic activator of protein kinase C. PIP2 hydrolysis was assayed in soluble and particulate fractions prepared from keratome biopsies of normal and psoriatic skin. Total lipids were extracted from normal and psoriatic epidermis and 1,2-diradylglycerol (a mixture of 1,2-diacylglycerol and 1-ether, 2-acyl-glycerol) quantitated by enzyme assay. Because 1,2-diacylglycerol is a more potent activator of protein kinase C, the relative proportions of 1,2-diacyl and 1-ether, 2-acylglycerol in uninvolved and involved psoriatic epidermis were determined. This was accomplished by separation of acetate derivatives of 1,2-diacylglycerol and 1-ether, 2-acyl-glycerol by thin layer chromatography. Soluble and membrane-associated phospholipase C-catalyzed PIP2 hydrolysis were increased 3.7 times (p less than 0.001) and 3 times (p less than 0.004), respectively, in psoriatic involved compared to uninvolved and normal epidermis. 1,2-diradylglycerol content was also significantly elevated (3 times, p less than 0.01) in psoriatic involved versus uninvolved and normal epidermis. Analysis of the acetate derivatives of 1,2-diradylglycerol in psoriatic uninvolved and involved epidermis revealed that 1,2-diacylglycerol was the major species (86% and 95%, respectively). There were no significant differences in either phospholipase C-catalyzed PIP2 hydrolysis or 1,2-diacylglycerol content between uninvolved and normal epidermis. 1,2-diacylglycerol purified from normal and involved psoriatic epidermis was capable of activating protein kinase C from normal epidermis in vitro. In epidermal slices, activation of protein kinase C by addition of 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol) resulted in subsequently decreased protein kinase C activity, a process termed down-regulation. These data are consistent with the possibility that the elevation in lesional 1,2-diacylglycerol content may account, in part, for the previously reported reduction of protein kinase C activity in psoriasis (Horn, Marks, Fisher, et al: J Invest Dermatol 88:220-222, 1987).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Efficiency of white cell filtration and a freeze-thaw procedure for removal of HIV-infected cells from blood. Strategies for diminishing the risk of blood transfusion-associated transmission of HIV-1 were evaluated. HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells were added to blood that was subsequently filtered by using different white cell (WBC) filters (cellulose acetate and polyester). The average log reduction of infected cells with polyester filters was at least 2.5 as measured by ID50 titration and polymerase chain reaction. In two WBC filtration experiments with blood from seropositive donors diluted 1:4 with seronegative blood, log reductions of 2.4 and greater than 2.5 were observed. No cell-free virus was retained by the filter used. A freeze-thaw procedure applied to HIV-1-contaminated blood resulted in a minimal log reduction. These results indicate that the reduction of HIV-1 infectivity as a result of filtration is mainly due to the removal of HIV-1-infected WBCs, and that complete removal of infected WBCs cannot be achieved by the current filtration or freeze-thaw procedures. However, the development of filters with enhanced ability to remove (possibly infected) WBCs may have the added benefit of improving the safety of donor blood, especially in multiply transfused patients.",Virus_Diseases

"No linkage between D2 dopamine receptor gene region and schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis is one of the major etiological hypotheses of schizophrenia. The well-established role of genetic factors in schizophrenia together with reports of increased D2 dopamine receptor densities in untreated schizophrenic patients support the D2 dopamine receptor gene as a strong candidate gene for schizophrenia. The recent cloning of the D2 dopamine receptor gene made it possible to test the involvement of the D2 dopamine receptor locus (DRD2) in a large Swedish and a smaller Californian schizophrenia pedigree. Using multipoint linkage analysis between schizophrenia and a genetic map that includes the DRD2 locus and assuming a dominant mode of inheritance, we were able to exclude the DRD2 locus with a lod score of -4.14 for the penetrance of 0.72 and with a lod score of -3.05 for the lower bound penetrance of 0.56. The area of exclusion (lod score, less than -2.00) extended 27 centimorgans. These results provide strong evidence against linkage of the D2 dopamine receptor gene region to schizophrenia in the two pedigrees investigated. We conclude that the genetic predisposition to schizophrenia in these pedigrees is not due to aberrations in the DRD2 locus or the porphobilinogen deaminase locus. Our results do not support the D2 dopamine receptor hypothesis of schizophrenia. However, they cannot exclude the possibility that other genes regulating aspects of D2 dopamine expression might be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia, such as the expression of two D2 dopamine receptor subtypes by alternative RNA splicing.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Central nervous system vasculitis after chickenpox--cause or coincidence? A 7.5 year old boy, known to have a seizure disorder, presented with an infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory, 10 weeks after severe chickenpox. Immunofluorescent antibody titre to the varicella zoster virus in the cerebrospinal fluid was 1:32. Cerebral angiography showed evidence of focal vasculitis. He presented again seven months later with an acute exacerbation of seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed an old posterior extension of the infarct, but a repeated angiography demonstrated an improvement in the vasculitic process. Cerebrospinal fluid antibody titre was again 1:32. Although this may have been an unfortunate coincidence, a possible association between chickenpox and vasculitis, similar to that reported with herpes zoster, and with potentially significant clinical implications, should be considered. As a definite proof can be obtained only by a brain biopsy, however, which is generally not indicated in such cases, only additional clinical reports can lead to delineation of this association as a definite entity.",Virus_Diseases
"Intensive liver care and management of acute hepatic failure. In describing acute liver failure, the term fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is used to denote patients with the most rapid progression, normally defined as the onset of encephalopathy within eight weeks of the onset of symptoms. For patients with a slower onset of encephalopathy, ranging from eight weeks to six months after the onset of symptoms, late-onset hepatic failure is the term used to reflect the overlap in clinical features with some patients with FHF. The importance of accurately determining the type of acute liver failure results from increasing evidence of an inverse relationship between the tempo of disease progression and the chances of recovery. Prognosis is also dependent on the underlying etiology. Principles of management are as follows: (1) an accurate recognition of the tempo of the hepatic failure--fulminant, late onset, acute on chronic--and the establishment of a likely etiology; (2) early detection and treatment of complications, particularly metabolic acidosis (early), renal failure, cerebral edema, and infection (late); (3) optimization of conditions for regeneration by maintenance of a near normal metabolic milieu (with removal of toxins by various methods of artificial liver support if necessary); and (4) early consideration of an orthotopic liver transplant for those patients in the poor prognosis group. Variations in the natural history and clinical features of acute liver failure (ALF) have led to a number of different classifications and subgroupings. Knowledge of these is important in relation to the assessment of prognosis and is even more important now that transplantation is a therapeutic option.",Virus_Diseases

Sixteen of 29 (55%) GBS patients were HIV-seropositive, a higher frequency of HIV infection than in blood donors drawn from the population served by these hospitals. All three chronic IDP patients were HIV-seronegative. In all HIV-seropositive patients, GBS was the initial illness that brought the patient to medical attention and led to the diagnosis of HIV infection. Compared with seronegative patients, the HIV-seropositive GBS patients were more likely to have generalized lymphadenopathy, CSF pleocytosis, coexistent CNS disturbance, and prior sexually transmitted disease. GBS in this region of Africa is frequently associated with HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases

"Phosgene (chlorophenyl)hydrazones, strong sensitizers found in yellow sweaters bleached with sodium hypochlorite, defined as causative allergens for contact dermatitis by an experimental screening method in animals [published erratum appears in Contact Dermatitis 1990 Nov;23(5):383] 12 young men developed allergic contact dermatitis from wearing yellow cotton sweaters. We attempted to identify the causative agents by an experimental screening method in animals. Guinea pigs were sensitized with an acetone extract of the sweater material, by means of the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Active ingredients were then separated from the extract, by step-by-step patch test screening of chromatographic fractions in the guinea pigs, and finally analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Although there were 2 allergens with important activity (1 in the fraction eluted from the silica gel column with hexane, and 1 in the methanol fraction), the present study is focussed on the fat-soluble allergens in the hexane fraction. GC-MS analysis revealed that 4 kinds of phosgene (chlorophenyl)hydrazones (PCPHs) were present in the hexane fraction. PCPHs prepared in our laboratory showed strong eliciting activities, not only in the guinea pigs sensitized with the extract, but also in a male volunteer sensitized by exposure to a yellow sweater during irritancy testing. Phosgene (2,5-dichlorophenyl)hydrazone, which was the main component among the PCPHs found in the sweater, sensitized guinea pigs even at the 1 ppm level. From these results, we conclude that PCPHs were one of the allergens responsible for the cases.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Delayed endolymphatic hydrops and its relationship to Meniere's disease. Delayed endolymphatic hydrops (EH) can be characterized as having ipsilateral and contralateral types. They are similar in that both have early and late phases of otologic symptoms and that the early phase is a profound hearing loss in one ear. The late phases differ, however, in that the ipsilateral type develops the symptoms of EH (episodic vertigo) in the deaf ear and the contralateral type develops the symptoms of EH (fluctuating hearing loss and/or episodic vertigo) in the hearing ear. In more than half the cases of both types of delayed EH, the profound hearing losses in the early phase are simply discovered to be present in early childhood without a known time of onset. The temporal bones of two patients with contralateral delayed EH show pathologic changes in the deaf ears that are similar to those known to occur in mumps and measles labyrinthitis, whereas the pathologic changes in the hearing ears are similar to those known to occur in Meniere's disease. These observations support the proposition that Meniere's disease may occur as a delayed sequela of inner ear damage sustained during an attack of subclinical viral labyrinthitis occurring in childhood.",Virus_Diseases
"Characterization of pemphigus foliaceus antigen from human epidermis. Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) and its endemic form, Fogo Selvagem (FS), are characterized by subcorneal vesicles and pathogenic IgG autoantibodies directed against keratinocyte surface antigens. A major pool of FS antigen(s) remains bound to the insoluble epidermal envelope fraction. In this paper we demonstrate that this antigen(s) can be released from the envelope fraction by sonication. By immune precipitation four components can be detected, having molecular weights (MW) of 260, 80, 62, and 45 kD. The 260-kD component is lost by boiling or extraction with glycine HCl at pH 2.8. The major components appear to be the 80- and 62-kD poly-peptides. They chromatograph as a unit by gel filtration in 0.1% SDS, in the MW range of 115-120 kD. The FS antigen(s) appears to be cationic, forming insoluble complexes at low pH with SDS, and is labile to ammonium sulfate and freezing and thawing. It is unaffected by positive pressure concentration, 50% acetone precipitation, and reduction/alkylation. The FS antigen(s) is precipitated by all FS and nonendemic PF sera except those in complete clinical and serologic remission. The FS antigen(s) is also precipitated by 50% of pemphigus vulgaris but none of the bullous pemphigoid sera tested. All FS antigenic components are immunoprecipitated by IgG4 autoantibodies, but the IgG1 subclass from the same patients appear to immunoprecipitate only the 62-kD polypeptide. The FS antigen(s) is able to adsorb human autoantibodies against human desmoglein 1 (DG1), but not rabbit antisera against bovine DG1 or 2. This paper shows that physical stress, i.e., sonication, may be able to solubilize sufficient FS antigen(s) from the epidermal envelope fractions for further chemical characterization. The relationship of these FS antigen(s) to other reported FS antigens is presently unknown.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Frequency, spectrum and occupational relevance of type IV allergies to rubber chemicals. 3851 consecutive patients patch tested between January 1985 and March 1990 have been analysed for rubber allergies. The incidence of rubber allergy was 3.8% (n = 145). In 80/145 patients (55%), the source of rubber sensitization was occupational, 67 of whom (84%) had acquired allergy from wearing rubber gloves at work. Most of them (36%) were employed in the health services. The most commonly positive rubber-mix in this group was thiuram-mix (72%) followed by carba-mix (25%). 13/80 patients (16%) had occupational rubber allergy from industrial rubber products other than gloves. Patch tests revealed thiuram-mix (62%) as the most commonly positive rubber-mix but, in contrast to the group with glove-induced rubber allergy, black-rubber-mix came second (38%). In 47/145 patients (32%), the source of rubber sensitization was non-occupational; in 18/145 (13%) the origin remained unknown.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Dengue-1 virus envelope glycoprotein gene expressed in recombinant baculovirus elicits virus-neutralizing antibody in mice and protects them from virus challenge. In order to test the feasibility of baculovirus (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, AcNPV) expression vectors for making immunogens against dengue-1 (DEN-1) virus, a portion of the envelope (E) glycoprotein gene of DEN-1 virus was cloned and expressed. The recombinant baculovirus contains 107 nucleotides from the 3' terminus of the DEN-1 matrix (M) gene, which encodes a hydrophobic signal peptide and extends through the first 1, 245 nucleotides of E, terminating 243 nucleotides before the 3' terminus of E. When the recombinant virus was grown in Spodoptera frugiperda cells, about 1 mg of E antigen was made per 10(9) cells. Recombinant E antigen reacted with E protein-specific monoclonal antibodies and stimulated production of DEN-1 virus neutralizing antibody in BALB/c mice. Mice immunized with recombinant E antigen or with heat-inactivated DEN-1 virus were protected significantly against lethal DEN-1 virus challenge. A dose/response effect was observed, with increasing amounts of recombinant antigen leading to increased survival. These results demonstrate the utility of baculovirus for producing immunogens against DEN-1 virus.",Virus_Diseases
"Cellular immune response toward human articular chondrocytes. T cell reactivities against chondrocyte and fibroblast membranes in destructive joint diseases. Articular cartilage is one of the major targets in destructive joint diseases in humans. We studied cellular immune reactions against cartilage cell-surface membranes, because it has recently been suggested that these represent possible antigenic structures, based upon the observation of autoantibodies with this specificity in certain joint diseases. A striking T cell reactivity toward chondrocyte membranes was found both in blood and synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This reactivity was strongly dependent on the presence of monocytes and had all the characteristics of an antigen-driven process. Clonal analysis demonstrated high precursor frequencies in peripheral blood T cells that were reactive against chondrocyte membranes. This response to chondrocyte membranes greatly exceeded the T cell stimulation induced by membranes from other sources such as fibroblasts or epithelial cells. In contrast to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, individuals with osteoarthritis showed a strong peripheral blood and synovial fluid T cell response not only to chondrocyte membranes, but also to fibroblast membrane material. However, there was no reactivity to epithelial cell membranes. Normal donors generally did not show significant responses to any membrane preparation. These data indicate that there is a strong T cell reactivity toward chondrocyte membranes in destructive joint disorders, and this may significantly contribute to the pathogenetic processes that occur in these diseases.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Marjolin's ulcer: a review and reevaluation of a difficult problem. The formation of an epidermoid carcinoma in nonhealing scar tissue, a Marjolin's ulcer, is a well described neoplasm. These lesions are, however, frequently overlooked and often inadequately treated. This paper reviews six cases of scar-tissue carcinoma. All lesions were secondary to various kinds of burns. Four of the Marjolin's ulcers were well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. One was a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and one was a malignant melanoma. The average age at presentation was 59 years, and the mean interval from time of burn injury to appearance of neoplasm was 36.8 years. The lesions varied in anatomic location and involved the upper extremities, lower extremities, and scalp. In addition to the case studies, this paper reviews the literature and provides a logical treatment plan for a patient with a Marjolin's ulcer. Because these lesions can be very aggressive, a well thought-out treatment plan is necessary to optimize care and assure patient survival.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The two groups were compared to determine the effect of mode of stabilization on outcome. Outcome was measured by time to union, development of complications, and clinical follow-up result. The groups were similar in regards to gender, age, and preoperative diagnosis. The external fixation group had a significantly higher prevalence of complications, including non-union, delayed union, and infection, than the internal fixation group. It was concluded that ankle arthrodesis with internal fixation is better tolerated and has fewer complications than techniques that use external fixation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Gastrointestinal motor dysfunction in acquired selective cholinergic dysautonomia associated with infectious mononucleosis. This report documents the disturbance in gastrointestinal motor function in a patient with selective cholinergic dysautonomia that occurred following acute infectious mononucleosis. Apart from the gut, other organs affected included the pupils, sweat glands, lacrimal and salivary glands, and urinary bladder. Autonomic function tests showed the preservation of sympathetic adrenergic functions in contrast to the generalized involvement of postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic cholinergic nerves, including denervation hypersensitivity of the pupil and urinary bladder to exogenous cholinergic agonists. Cardiac and abdominal vagal responses were abnormal. Colon myenteric plexus ganglion cells were normal by morphological and immunohistochemical studies, suggesting that the selective cholinergic dysautonomia was the most likely pathophysiologic process responsible for the observed motility disorder. This study documents the occurrence of selective cholinergic dysautonomia following a viral illness, the importance of the extrinsic neural control on the motor function of the gastrointestinal tract, and the usefulness of combined motility and autonomic function testing in the evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of gut dysmotility.",Virus_Diseases

"Glucocorticoid level and neuropsychiatric symptoms in homosexual men with HIV infection. OBJECTIVE: There is a controversial literature suggesting that stress, anxiety, and depression are harmful to the immune system and therefore to health. Preclinical studies indicate that activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by stress may be responsible for immunocompromise. The goal of this study was to assess this phenomenon in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHOD: Homosexual men in the community who did not meet modified Centers for Disease Control criteria for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were recruited for the study; 113 of the men were HIV positive and 77 were HIV negative. Very few of the men studied suffered from depression or anxiety disorder at the time of the first assessment. Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol levels were obtained from the 112 HIV-positive and 75 HIV-negative men whose 24-hour urine volumes were 500 ml or more. Cortisol levels were correlated with measures of medical, immunological, neurological, and psychiatric status. RESULTS: Small but significant correlations between 24-hour urinary free cortisol and medical status, level of depression, and level of anxiety were found in the HIV-positive group. There was no relationship between cortisol level and the number of CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes or the CD4-CD8 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Although HPA activation may be associated with stress in cases of HIV infection, it does not seem to be associated with further loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Subjects with HIV infection with the most evidence of medical complications may also be the most anxious and depressed.",Virus_Diseases
"Efficiency of opaque photoprotective agents in the visible light range. ""Opaque"" physical sunscreens are important for photoprotection of individuals with visible light and UV-A photosensitivity such as those with porphyria, drug photoallergy, and polymorphous light eruption. Diffuse spectral transmittance of various thicknesses of opaque sunscreen formulations were measured from 350- to 800-nm range using a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Transmission through 20% zinc oxide paste was high and decreased minimally despite large increases in the sunscreen layer thickness. Adding a visible light absorber such as iron oxide to scattering sunscreens, however, substantially lowered transmittance below that predicted by the product of the transmittances for each component alone. Opaque sunscreens protected against hematoporphyrin derivative photosensitization of albino guinea pig skin; these results were quantitatively consistent with the in vitro findings. Poor photoprotection against visible light is obtained with white paste sunscreens, even if thick layers are applied. The addition of pigments to such sunscreens, however, greatly enhances photoprotection and cosmetic acceptability.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Renal failure in patients with AIDS-related complex. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC) can be associated with nephropathy and renal failure.

Eight patients with ARC and renal failure were recently evaluated. Renal biopsies in 4 patients revealed focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis while 2 others showed proliferative and necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents. The implications of this study are that ARC patients with renal failure should be fully evaluated and be considered for long-term dialysis.

"Evidence from Zaire that breast-feeding by HIV-1-seropositive mothers is not a major route for perinatal HIV-1 transmission but does decrease morbidity. Breast-feeding as a route of HIV-1 transmission during infancy but also as a protective measure against early childhood morbidity has been investigated prospectively in children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and control children born to age- and parity-matched HIV-1-seronegative women. The mothers of all study children had been enrolled antenatally at a maternity hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire, which served a relatively affluent group of women who sometimes chose not to breast-feed their infants. In 106 children born to HIV-1-seropositive women, the rate of HIV-1 transmission was 21% in 28 infants exclusively breast-fed, 19% in 68 infants both breast- and bottle-fed and 0% in 10 infants who were bottle-fed only (P = 0.35). In contrast, non-HIV-1-infected children of both HIV-1-seropositive and HIV-1-seronegative mothers who were exclusively breast-fed compared with uninfected children who were not exclusively breast-fed had significantly lower incidence rates of acute diarrhea, fever and lower respiratory tract infection. The lack of a dose-response effect between breast-feeding and perinatal HIV-1 transmission and the presence of a protective effect of breast-feeding against common causes of early childhood morbidity and mortality support the current World Health Organization recommendation that breast-feeding should continue to be promoted in all developing countries, including those with high HIV-1 prevalence rates in women of childbearing age.",Virus_Diseases

The patient exhibited features characteristic of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, such as fragility, hyperextensibility, and bruisability of the skin and large veins were readily seen, but no hypermobility of any joint was detectable. Biochemical studies of the connective tissue confirmed that the apparent synthesis of collagens was within normal limits, but the deposition of the major proteoglycan in the skin of this patient was markedly reduced, mainly because the synthesis of core protein of dermatan sulphate proteoglycan was defective.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Growth factor and proto-oncogene expression in psoriasis. The expression of several proto-oncogenes and growth factors was analyzed in normal skin and psoriatic lesions by RNA blot hybridization. Isolation of intact RNA from frozen biopsy samples required immediate exposure to denaturants during tissue homogenization. Lipocortin II and cyclophilin transcripts were used as internal controls. These transcripts were abundant and slightly but significantly elevated in psoriatic lesions. When results were normalized according to these reference transcripts, there was no increase in the expression of c-myc, c-Ha-ras, c-erbB (EGF receptor), c-jun, or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) transcripts in psoriatic lesions, and lesional c-fos transcripts were decreased relative to normal skin. In contrast, expression of TGF-alpha mRNA transcripts were markedly increased in psoriatic lesions even after normalization. Placement of normal or psoriatic tissue in organ culture for 2 to 4 h resulted in strong induction of c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc transcripts, but not of the other genes studied. Thus, overexpression of proto-oncogenes may be more characteristic of the epidermal response to acute injury than of the steady-state hyperplasia characteristic of psoriasis. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) increased TGF-alpha mRNA levels in cultured human KC at long time intervals (24-48 h). However, of various cytokines tested, only EGF and TGF-alpha induced TGF-alpha mRNA after short time intervals (2-4 h). These results as well as the selective overabundance of TGF-alpha mRNA in psoriatic lesions among various cytokines tested suggest that activation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase by TGF-alpha is important in the pathogenesis of psoriatic epidermal hyperplasia.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Cholesterol and wax ester fractions were similar in all four groups but triglycerides and squalene were significantly increased and free fatty acids significantly decreased in HIV-positive patients, regardless of the presence of seborrheic dermatitis. In addition, a strong negative correlation was found between free fatty acid and triglyceride levels.

Blood examination included white cell count and estimations of haemoglobin, urea, glucose, and electrolyte concentrations and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. A firm diagnosis was established in 278 patients (38%). Pyogenic meningitis (n = 134), measles encephalopathy (n = 38), and electrolyte imbalance (n = 23) were important causes in this group, cerebral malaria (n = 4) was uncommon and there were no cases of Reye's syndrome. The diagnoses of the remaining 462 were combined under the heading 'acute unexplained encephalopathy'. Altogether 394 of the 462 patients underwent virological investigations for arboviruses and 92 (23%) had one or more indicators of Japanese encephalitis. No other arboviruses could be isolated. Throat swabs from 187 patients with acute unexplained encephalopathy were studied on monkey kidney tissue cell lines of which 14 were positive (8%). These were identified as adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, poliomyelitis, Coxsackie, and echovirus; in two cases the virus was untypable.

"A controlled study of inhaled pentamidine for primary prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. BACKGROUND. Current recommendations for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) are based on data from patients who have had at least one episode of PCP (secondary prevention). We designed a study to determine the efficacy and side effects of inhaled pentamidine in the primary prevention of PCP. METHODS. Two hundred twenty-three patients sero-positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) but not PCP, who had advanced AIDS-related complex, or who had less than 0.2 x 10(9) CD4-positive lymphocytes per liter received either 300 mg of pentamidine isethionate or 300 mg of sodium isethionate every 28 days by inhaler. The proportion of patients surviving without PCP was analyzed with the log-rank test as a function of time spent in the trial, according to the intention to treat with either placebo or pentamidine. RESULTS. The third of five planned interim analyses showed a significant difference in the occurrence of PCP, with 8 cases in pentamidine group and 23 in the placebo group (nominal P value = 0.0021). There were no deaths within 60 days of the diagnosis of PCP and no significant differences in survival between groups. Approximately 53 inhalations were needed to prevent one episode of pneumonia. Thirty-eight of 114 patients given pentamidine (33 percent) and 7 of 109 given placebo (6 percent) had moderate-to-severe coughing during inhalations (two-tailed P less than 0.00001), which caused 4 patients given pentamidine (3.5 percent) to discontinue taking it. CONCLUSIONS. A dose of 300 mg of aerosolized pentamidine given every four weeks was well tolerated and 60 to 70 percent effective in preventing a first episode of PCP in patients with HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases

We studied the impact of disease severity and medication in a group of nine RA patients with proven septic arthritis, excluding those occurring as a complication of orthopaedic surgery. Two control groups were used for comparison. The septic arthritis patients were functionally more incapacitated and more often treated with cytotoxic drugs. Six of the nine septic arthritis patients had received an intra-articular injection into the infected joint within 3 months prior to the onset of the septic arthritis. Only one of these occurred immediately after arthrocentesis. The annual frequency of septic arthritis was approximately 0.2%. During the 4-year period studied the frequency was 0.5%. When related to the number of glucocorticosteroid injections, a frequency of 1 per 2000 injections was found when late septic arthritis was included.

Plasma was separated by first filtration; a second filtration separated the plasma components. Three liters of plasma were treated in each PP session. With each PP treatment, total protein (TP) removed was 20 +/- 5% and serum albumin removed was +/- 6%. Serum Al rose significantly (p less than 0.01 from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 2.8 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl post-PP. Serum Zn, Cu, and Fe decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) from 86.2 +/- 7.4 micrograms/dl, 126 +/- 18 micrograms/dl, and 108 +/- 14 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 58.4 +/- 10.2 micrograms/dl, 104 +/- 6 micrograms/dl, and 82 +/- 16 micrograms/dl post-PP, respectively. Two days after the end of the six-month PP treatment, serum Al levels rose significantly (p less than 0.01), from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl to 3.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl.

Although only focal necrosis of the tumor was seen in the one day SW exposure, wider and deeper tumor necrosis was observed in the tumors following serial SW (2000 to 6000 shots, for two to three days). Eight to 10 day serial SW exposure (6000 to 8000 shots) decreased the tumor growth in comparison with that of the control. Lung metastases examined by periodic chest X-ray after SW treatment revealed that SW did not promote lung metastases. Pathological findings were also in accord with the X-ray examinations. Polyclonal antibody type 4 collagen was used for immunohistochemical staining of vascular wall in bladder cancer. Vascular wall destruction, not found in spontaneous necrotic tumor, were clearly visible in SW induced necrotic area.

"Impact of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 on tuberculosis in rural Haiti. We conducted a case-control study to determine the relative and attributable risk of HIV seropositivity for bacillary-positive (smear and/or culture) pulmonary tuberculosis in Haiti. There were 274 patients with tuberculosis and an equal number of control subjects. Antibodies to HIV were present in 67 (24%) patients and eight (3%) control subjects. Odds ratios suggested that the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis was 15.7 times as great (95% confidence interval, 4.8 to 5.0; p less than 0.05) in patients 20 to 39 yr of age who were HIV-seropositive than in HIV-seronegative patients. In contrast, the relative risk in those 40 to 59 yr of age was elevated (3.0 times), though not significantly (lower 95% confidence interval, 0.8). In the 20- to 39-yr age group, 31% of tuberculosis was attributable to HIV infection (95% confidence interval between 23 and 39%). HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients did not differ with respect to sputum smear positivity. HIV-seronegative patients were twice as likely to be infected with resistant organisms, though this was not significant. We conclude that HIV infection is a major risk factor for pulmonary tuberculosis in young adult residents of Haiti. This, together with the fact that similar proportions of HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients were potentially infectious, suggests that without vigorous counteraction tuberculosis will become a greater problem for Haiti.",Virus_Diseases

Iron can be taken up by the liver in several forms and by several pathways including: (1) receptor-mediated endocytosis of diferric or monoferric transferrin or ferritin, (2) reduction and carrier-facilitated internalization of iron from transferrin without internalization of the protein moiety of transferrin, (3) electrogenic uptake of low molecular weight, non-protein bound forms of iron, and (4) uptake of heme from heme-albumin, heme-hemopexin, or hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. Normally, pathway 2 is probably the major one for uptake of iron by hepatocytes. Iron is stored in the liver in the cores of ferritin shells and as hemosiderin, an insoluble product derived from iron-rich ferritin. Iron in hepatocytes stimulates translation of ferritin mRNA and represses transcription of DNA for transferrin and transferrin receptors. The major pathologic effects of chronic hepatic iron overload are: (1) fibrosis and cirrhosis, (2) porphyria cutanea tarda, and (3) hepatocellular carcinoma. Although precise pathogenetic mechanisms remain unknown, iron probably produces these and other toxic effects by increasing oxidative stress and lysosomal lability. Vigorous efforts at diagnosis and treatment of iron overload are essential since the pathologic effects of iron are totally preventable by early vigorous iron removal and prevention of iron re-accumulation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"HIV-positive women: reasons they are tested for HIV and their clinical characteristics on entry into the health care system  STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the reasons for the HIV testing of HIV-positive women and their clinical presentation and to make specific laboratory comparisons between women intravenous drug users (IVDUs) and non-IVDUs who were heterosexually infected (HTs). DESIGN: Consecutive case series. SETTING: Four primary care sites associated with the Brown University AIDS Program. PARTICIPANTS: 140 consecutive HIV-seropositive women. RESULTS: The most common reason for HIV testing in both groups was self-perception of risk. Presenting T-helper lymphocyte counts, leukocyte counts, and hematocrits did not differ significantly between the groups. Intravenous drug users were significantly more likely than HTs to have evidence of hepatitis B virus exposure (p less than 0.0001) and to report the history of a sexually transmitted disease (p = 0.005). Twenty percent of HTs versus 10% of IVDUs were tested only after they had HIV-related symptoms. The most frequent clinical presentation for both groups was Centers for Disease Control Group IV/A constitutional symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Many HIV-seropositive women do not enter the health care system until they are symptomatic, but those infected heterosexually and those using parenteral drugs have similar laboratory indices at presentation. AIDS education strategies toward all women at risk must include information about manifestations of HIV disease in women, as well as preventive measures, to ensure early access to the health care system.",Virus_Diseases
"Red tattoo reactions: X-ray microanalysis and patch-test studies. Eighteen patients who developed cutaneous reactions to red tattoos were studied to identify the chemicals responsible for the reactions to modern red tattoo pigments. Biopsies from the tattoos were examined histologically and the chemical composition of the red pigments was analysed by X-ray microanalysis. A variety of metallic elements including aluminium, iron, calcium, titanium, silicon, mercury and cadmium were detected. Patch tests were performed to the relevant chemicals in nine cases, and only one patient reacted to mercury. This study demonstrates that although reactions to mercury still occur, other red dyes containing a variety of inorganic pigments may provoke a cutaneous inflammatory response.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"HIV-associated myocarditis. Pathology and immunopathology. Autopsy studies of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) patients showed a high incidence of myocarditis. To attain a better understanding of the pathogenesis, the pathology and immunopathology of nine endomyocardial biopsies with active myocarditis from 18 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients were systematically characterized. These were compared with 17 biopsies with active myocarditis from patients without AIDS risk factors. In both groups, the myocarditis consisted of either multifocal or interstitial infiltrates of small lymphocytes and isolated myocyte necrosis. The lymphocytes consisted of T cells (CD2+, CD3+) and cells not identified by the usual markers. B cells, monocytes, CD4+ cells, and natural killer (NK) cells were only rarely observed. All of the HIV-positive patients but only 7 of 17 non-HIV patients had CD8+ lymphocytes in the infiltrates (P less than 0.01). The arteriolar endothelium demonstrated induced class I (HLA-A, B, C) and II (HLA-DR) antigens in both groups. In situ hybridization for HIV-1 failed to identify the virus in the specimens. The immunopathology is consistent with a cell-mediated injury to the myocytes in HIV-positive patients and is similar to a subgroup of myocarditis in the non-HIV group.",Virus_Diseases
"Susceptibility to Coxsackievirus B3-induced chronic myocarditis maps near the murine Tcr alpha and Myhc alpha loci on chromosome 14. This study was undertaken to determine the genetic control of host susceptibility to coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced chronic myocarditis in a mouse model. An autosomal recessive autoimmune myocardial disease (amd) gene (possibly more than one gene), which determined susceptibility to CVB3-induced chronic myocarditis in the A/J and DBA/2J inbred mouse strains, was mapped to a segment of chromosome 14. Data from both the AXB/BXA recombinant inbred (RI) strains and the B10.D2(57N) H-8b congenic mice supported this linkage relationship. Analysis of the AXB/BXA RI strain distribution patterns suggested that amd maps distal to the Np-2, Tcr alpha, and Myhc alpha loci.",Virus_Diseases
"Molecular pathologic study of human papillomavirus infection in inverted papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. Nasal inverted papilloma is a rare benign tumor occasionally associated with squamous cell carcinoma. To determine the etiological role of human papillomavirus in inverted papilloma, and to clarify the relationship between human papillomavirus and malignant transformation of this benign tumor, we retrospectively analyzed inverted papillomas from 26 patients, 7 of whom had squamous cell carcinoma. We used an immunohistochemical method and molecular pathologic techniques, or dot-blot hybridization of DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction. Human papillomavirus was detected in 5 of 26 patients (19%), 3 patients with human papillomavirus 11 and 2 patients with human papillomavirus 16. The latter 2 patients had inverted papillomas associated with squamous cell carcinoma. We speculate that human papillomavirus may be related to the malignant transformation of inverted papillomas.",Virus_Diseases
"Immunogenetic heterogeneity in rheumatoid disease as illustrated by different MHC associations (DQ, Dw and C4) in articular and extra-articular subsets. Genetic variants at DRB1 (Dw subtypes), DQB, and C4 loci were compared in rheumatoid disease subjects with or without the extra-articular feature of Felty's syndrome or major vasculitis. DR4 positive subjects with rheumatoid arthritis alone showed no preferential associations with DQB or Dw variants or with C4 null alleles. Felty's subjects showed associations with the DQB encoded DQw7 allele and with the C4B null allele but no preferential associations with any Dw subtype of DR4. By contrast DR4 +ve rheumatoid-vasculitic subjects showed associations with the Dw14 as well as with DQw7 and the C4A null allele. These different MHC associations in different clinical disease subsets show that rheumatoid disease is immunogenetically heterogeneous and suggest that MHC genes outside the DRB1 locus may also influence susceptibility or modify expression of the rheumatoid disease process.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Mastoid surgery at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital 1986-1988. Eighty-three children between ages 0-12 years had mastoid surgery in the three year period 1986-88. The indications were acute mastoiditis (30 children), uncontrolled chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) (24 children), cholesteatoma (22 children) and a miscellaneous group (7 children). Forty-seven per cent of those with acute mastoiditis were under one year but the 27 per cent with cholesteatoma as the precipitating cause were 4-12 years. Twenty-three per cent had significant complications. Typmano-mastoid surgery was employed to resolve uncontrolled CSOM. Children were between 2-12 years and 62 per cent were below the 25th centile for weight. Seventy-nine per cent of the tympanic membrane grafts were successful. The children with cholesteatoma were between 3-12 years and 76 per cent were below the 25th centile for weight. Eight of them only presented after the onset of acute mastoiditis. One child had a definite congenital cholesteatoma. Only one had a pars flaccida origin of the cholesteatoma sac and only eight an origin from the postero-superior pars tensa.

All the adherent synovial cells from patients without RA did not release interleukin 1 (IL-1) beta and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) spontaneously, while those cells released comparable amounts of IL-1 beta, but not PGE2 to RA cells after type II collagen stimulation. Only the synovial cells from RA, irrespective of morphology and cloning, released IL-1 beta and PGE2 without stimulation.

"The cutaneous manifestations in children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis). A six-year study. In a six-year study of 46 children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis), 20 children (43 per cent) developed cutaneous manifestations. Ten children had 18 episodes of erysipelas-like erythema which proved to be specific for the disease. Twelve children (26 per cent) had 31 episodes of non-specific purpuric rash and six children (13 per cent) had nine episodes of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Other manifestations included diffuse erythema of the face, and/or trunk, angioneurotic oedema, diffuse erythema of the palms and soles followed by mild desquamation of the skin, Raynaud's phenomenon and a subcutaneous nodule. The mean frequency of the cutaneous lesions was 1.6/patient/year before colchicine therapy and 0.4/patient/year after colchicine therapy (p = 0.0005). The high incidence of cutaneous manifestations and their response to colchicine strongly suggest that skin involvement is an integral part familial Mediterranean fever.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Quantitative neurologic and neurobehavioral testing of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Assessment of neurobehavioral and peripheral neurologic performance among homosexual men was made on two occasions, using a computer-administered neurobehavioral instrument and quantitative vibration threshold testing, respectively. Persons studied included high-risk human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative men (n = 13), asymptomatic HIV-positive men (n = 30), and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex of AIDS (n = 17). In addition, subjects were characterized immunologically at the time of neurologic and neuropsychologic assessment via determination of circulating lymphocyte counts (total lymphocytes, helper T cells, suppressor T cells, total T cells, activated T cells) and markers of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection. At the first cycle of testing, the results of asymptomatic HIV-positive men were indistinguishable from those of HIV-negative men, while persons with AIDS-related complex or AIDS tended to have lower mean performance. These differences did not achieve statistical significance on any single test, but the group with AIDS-related complex or AIDS had the worst mean performance on 12 of 13 individual performance tests. Thirty-seven men underwent repeated testing after a mean interval of approximately 4.5 months. There was little change in mean neurobehavioral performance and vibratory thresholds among all three groups. Measures of neurobehavioral performance and vibrotactile thresholds were not correlated with measures of immunological status. These results are consistent with the concept that asymptomatic infection with HIV-1 does not imply the presence of measurable or significant neurologic or neurobehavioral impairment.",Virus_Diseases
"Genital human papillomavirus infection in men. Diagnosis and treatment with a laser and 5-fluorouracil. One hundred twenty-eight consecutive men, sexual partners (for more than six months) of women treated for genital condylomata acuminata, were evaluated with colposcopy to assess the percentage of infected men among the couples. Ninety-three (73%) of the men were found to have a genital human papillomavirus infection on colposcopically directed biopsies. All but one patient were treated with outpatient colposcopically guided laser vaporization under local anesthesia (one patient with extensive condylomata required general anesthesia). Two weeks after laser surgery, 5% 5-fluorouracil cream, used in the genital area, was initiated on a weekly basis for two months and every other week for two more months. Patients were followed in the clinic with colposcopy performed every eight weeks for six months to evaluate the regimen's results. Thirty-seven (40%) of the 93 men had ""clinically"" apparent genital HPV infection, and 56 (60%) of the 93 had ""subclinical"" disease (as determined with colposcopy). The majority of the patients (87 of 93, or 94%) responded to one laser treatment followed by 5-fluorouracil cream and had no visible lesions at six months. Colposcopic evaluation of the male partners of infected women and laser surgery followed by topical 5-fluorouracil therapy appear to be safe and effective in controlling genital HPV infection.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Clinical significance of small-intestinal microsporidiosis in HIV-1-infected individuals  To assess the importance of microsporidiosis of the small intestine in the pathogenesis of chronic diarrhoea in HIV-1-infected individuals, duodenal biopsy samples from the following three patient groups were prospectively evaluated for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens by standard methods, and for microsporidia by light microscopy: 55 consecutive HIV-1-antibody-positive subjects with unexplained diarrhoea of at least 3 weeks duration (group A); 38 HIV-1-seropositive subjects without diarrhoea (group B) who consecutively underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for various reasons; and 7 patients without known risk factors for HIV infection with chronic unexplained diarrhoea (group C). In groups A and B most subjects had had previous AIDS-defining opportunistic infections and the median peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte count was less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l. Microsporidia were detected as the single pathogen in 15 of the group A compared with 1 (in whom diarrhoea subsequently developed) of the group B patients (p = 0.001) and none of the group C patients. With the exception of 4 of the group A patients, no other intestinal pathogens were identified in any of the patients. The median peripheral blood CD4 count was significantly lower in patients with detectable microsporidia than in those without microsporidiosis (0.03 x 10(9)/l vs 0.06 x 10(9)/l; p = 0.03); in all patients with microsporidiosis, the CD4 count was equal to or less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l. 13 patients with microsporidiosis were treated with metronidazole, in 10 of whom treatment led to a substantial improvement or disappearance of diarrhoea within days of starting therapy, but did not result in eradication of the parasite in the 5 patients who underwent repeat biopsy. The findings suggest that small-intestinal microsporidiosis is an important cause of chronic unexplained diarrhoea in HIV-1-infected individuals with pronounced cellular immune deficiency. This infection should therefore be added to the list of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections.",Virus_Diseases

Sixty-two consecutive patients, with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who received D-penicillamine were studied retrospectively to identify predictive risk factors for D-penicillamine toxicity. Thirty-two developed side effects, while 30 did not. The clinical picture in both groups was similar, but the group with D-penicillamine toxicity was characterized by a high incidence of anti-Ro(SSA) antibodies (p less than 0.01) or circulating cryoglobulins (p less than 0.001). The presence of anti-Ro(SSA) antibodies was not correlated with the presence of circulating cryoglobulins (p greater than 0.5), while the coefficient of contingency (C) between anti-Ro(SSA) and cryoglobulins was 0.131. Men were predisposed to express more renal pathology (p less than 0.025), while anti-Ro(SSA) positive patients with RA more often expressed rashes (p less than 0.0001) and acute febrile reactions (p less than 0.05) than anti-Ro(SSA) negative patients.

"Isolation and direct characterization of resident microglial cells from the normal and inflamed central nervous system. In addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (CNS), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen CD45, many cells were coisolated that were MRC OX42+ (complement receptor 3/CD11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of CD45 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Most cells from normal CNS, in contrast, lay within this latter, CD45low population. From previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated CD45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. Using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating CD45, CD4, and MHC class I molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of MHC class II molecules. A 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed CNS provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. In normal CNS, a very small population of blood-derived CD45high-expressing cells are present; most MHC class II expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia.",Virus_Diseases

In addition to previously presented patients with allergic contact dermatitis from cycloaliphatic epoxy resins (ERs), during 1974-1990, we have seen 4 patients with allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) caused by products containing uncured non-diglycidyl-ether-of-bisphenol-A ER. The patients were negative on patch testing with the standard ER based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA-ER). The following non-DGEBA-ERs were included in the causative agents: heterocyclic dimethylhydantoin ER, phenol novolak ER, and brominated ER. We were unable to specify the type of ER in an epoxy primer used by the 4th patient. Apart from the ACD caused by the brominated ER, 1 of the patients also had IgE-mediated occupational rhinitis caused by methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA), an epoxy hardener. The diagnosis was verified by positive prick tests and specific IgE determinations with MHHPA. Intense rhinitis evoked by a bronchial challenge with MHHPA confirmed the diagnosis.

"Predicting progression to AIDS: combined usefulness of CD4 lymphocyte counts and p24 antigenemia  PURPOSE: To investigate the combined usefulness of CD4 lymphocyte counts and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen in predicting progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: CD4 lymphocyte counts and HIV-1 p24 antigen status were evaluated over a 4-year period in 518 HIV-1-seropositive men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study in Chicago. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent (134 of 518) of the HIV-1-seropositive cohort had detectable p24 antigen during the study period. Men with p24 antigenemia experienced a more rapid decline in CD4 lymphocyte counts than men who were persistently p24 antigen-negative (p less than 0.01). Mean CD4 lymphocyte counts at first detection of p24 antigen were 406 and 455 cells/microL for men with incident and prevalent antigenemia, respectively. Antigen was detected in 61% (63 of 103) of the men who progressed to AIDS and in only 17% (71 of 415) of the men who did not (p less than 0.0001). The 4-year estimated cumulative AIDS incidence was 86%, 63%, and 21% for men with entry CD4 counts less than 200, 200 to 399, and 400 or more cells/microL, respectively. Presence of p24 antigenemia was strongly associated with more rapid disease progression within each of these CD4 groupings (p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that p24 antigenemia can first be detected with moderate CD4 cell depletion, is associated with a more rapid decline in the CD4 lymphocyte population, and combined with CD4 lymphocyte counts is useful in identifying individuals at significantly greater risk of disease progression. Our findings provide important information for assessing HIV-1 disease prognosis over a 4-year period.",Virus_Diseases
"Descartes before the horse: I clone, therefore I am: the hepatitis C virus in current perspective. In an unprecedented approach to viral discovery, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) was cloned before it was established by conventional methods of viral detection or by genomic characterization. Hepatitis C virus is a small (10-kb), single-stranded RNA virus with a genomic organization that places it in the family Flaviviridae. The virus is global in distribution, with a prevalence between 0.3% and 1.5%. The same agent causes parenterally acquired and sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Nonparenteral modes of spread are poorly defined, but low-level sexual transmission is probable. There is a strong association between the presence of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) and hepatocellular carcinoma; a causal role for HCV is suspected but has not been proved. Hepatitis C virus accounts for at least 85% of the cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis; an anti-HCV-reactive donor was retrospectively identified in nearly 90% of cases. Among donors confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) to be anti-HCV positive, 80% to 90% are infectious. Hepatitis C virus RNA can be detected within 1 to 2 weeks of exposure and persists throughout the course of infection. Generally, the presence of anti-HCV cannot be confirmed until 9 to 20 weeks after exposure, creating a window period of seronegativity and potential infectivity. It is anticipated that the anti-HCV assay will reduce the number of cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis by 50% in the United States; a 70% reduction has been documented in Spain.",Virus_Diseases
"Increased plasma histamine levels in uraemic pruritus. 1. We determined plasma levels of histamine in uraemic patients and examined their correlation with the presence of pruritus. 2. In 27 patients with chronic renal failure, plasma histamine levels were analysed by radioimmunoassay and were compared with those of 40 healthy adult subjects. The control population showed plasma histamine concentrations of 185 +/- 33 pg/ml, which were significantly lower than those of the patients with renal insufficiency. The highest levels (552 +/- 116 pg of histamine/ml) were found in 16 patients with chronic renal failure (mean serum creatinine 5.1 +/- 1.0 mg/dl) and severe itching. 3. Twelve patients with pronounced pruritus who were on maintenance haemodialysis (serum creatinine 9.2 +/- 1.2 mg/dl) had a mean plasma histamine concentration of 515 +/- 81 pg/ml. Fifteen patients on regular haemodialysis (serum creatinine 9.0 +/- 1.5 mg/dl) and who experienced itching had plasma histamine levels (322 +/- 40 pg/ml) which were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than those of the patients with pruritus but which were elevated compared with those of the control population (P less than 0.01). 4. No correlation could be found between increased plasma histamine levels and the type of dialysis membrane used or the method of sterilization of the membrane. 5. Haemodialysis alone did not reduce plasma histamine concentrations, although high concentrations could be detected in the ultrafiltrate.

"Role of T lymphocyte subsets in the pathogenesis of primary infection and rechallenge with respiratory syncytial virus in mice. The role of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in terminating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication, causing disease, and protecting from reinfection was investigated using a BALB/c mouse model in which CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes or both were depleted by injections of Mab directed against the respective mouse lymphocyte determinants. Kinetics of RSV replication, illness, and pathology were assessed after primary infection and rechallenge. Both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte subsets were involved in terminating RSV replication after primary infection. When both T lymphocyte subsets were depleted RSV replication was markedly prolonged, yet no illness was evident, suggesting that host immune response rather than viral cytocidal effect was the primary determinant of disease in mice. Both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes contributed to illness, although CD8+ lymphocytes appeared to play the dominant role in this particular system. Analysis of histological responses suggested that CD4+ lymphocytes were required for the appearance of peribronchovascular lymphocytic aggregates seen in normal mice after rechallenge, and that the presence of alveolar lymphocytes was correlated with illness. It is postulated that antibody is an illness-sparing mechanism for protecting mice from RSV infection, and that T lymphocytes are an important determinant of illness. Further delineation of RSV-induced immunopathogenesis in primary infection and reinfection will provide important information for the development of vaccine strategies.",Virus_Diseases
"Surgical management of palmar hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis is an idiopathic pathologic condition characterized by excessive sweating beyond that required to cool the body. Disturbance of the central nervous system, endocrine system, or obesity has been associated with this condition. Patients have a history of several years of occupational or social embarrassment. Individuals of Japanese ancestry and Jews of Northern African, Yemeni, or Balkan descent are predisposed to the condition. Nonoperative therapy is merely temporizing and unacceptable because of lack of efficacy or side effects. Surgical intervention provides effective and permanent control. The key to surgical correction appears to be the division of the sympathetic chain above the T-2 ganglion and below the T-3 ganglion of the involved side with removal of the entire T2-3 segment with its corresponding spinal nerves. This paper presents our experience with the dorsal thoracic approach for interruption of sympathetic innervation for severe palmar hyperhidrosis.

"Acute and chronic symptoms of mononucleosis. BACKGROUND. The clinical symptoms and durations of illness of patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) are variable and are poorly documented in the scientific literature. METHODS. Patients who presented for care at the Student Health Service of a Canadian university between September 1985 and May 1988 and had been diagnosed as having IM were surveyed. Health experience during the acute and convalescent phases of IM was compared with that of a group of patients matched for age, sex, date of diagnosis, and year of study, who had suffered acute upper respiratory tract infections (URI), other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced, during the same period. RESULTS. Students were sicker for longer after IM than after non-EBV-induced URI. During the acute phase of illness, the symptoms of fatigue (P = less than .000001), night sweats (P = .000001), and painful neck swelling (P = .00003) were seen significantly more often in the IM group. The severity and duration of these symptoms were also significantly worse in IM patients. Getting tired easily (P = .002), diurnal somnolence (P = .002), and depression (P = .002) were significantly more common postacute symptoms. Eleven percent of IM patients reported persistence of symptoms longer than 100 days, and in 6% of patients the symptoms had persisted after 1 year. Convalescent cases showed a trend toward reduced alcohol intake and, perhaps, reduced alcohol tolerance. CONCLUSIONS. IM involves excessive morbidity in a student community compared with URI that was other than EBV-induced, during both the acute and the postacute phases of infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Psoriasis vulgaris: a genetic approach. Evidence for a genetic contribution in psoriasis comes from direct examination of a large segment of the population in an isolated island environment, epidemiologic and questionnaire studies presented to psoriatic patients, twin studies collected from the literature and from twin registries, and splitsibship analysis. The concordance of psoriasis in monozygotic twins was 65-72%, whereas psoriasis in dizygotic twins was 15-30%. Determination of concordance in older twin pairs from a national twin registry in Denmark revealed nearly 90-100% heritability. In order to link psoriasis with known markers within the human genome, serologic studies have been carried out with a variety of blood group and polymorphic protein antigens. A weak association with the MNS and Lewis Blood Groups Systems (relative risk, 3.5) has been identified. Stronger associations with class I B locus and class II D locus genes (relative risk, 8-12) have also been determined by studies of the human lymphocyte-antigen system. Finally, a strong association with HLA Cw6 has been determined; this marker is thought to be in linkage disequilibrium with B and D locus genes previously associated with psoriasis. The relative risk of developing psoriasis in HLA Cw6 positive individuals is about 24. A few large kindred have been reported in the dermatology literature. These support the hypothesis of autosomal dominant inheritance with penetrance of approximately 60%. In cooperation with The National Psoriasis Foundation, we have now identified over 90 families with psoriasis in three generations. We have begun the process of ascertainment, the construction of family trees, and the collection of leukocyte DNA for linkage analysis with established restriction fragment polymorphisms (RFLP). Our initial assessment is being directed to four RFLP that span approximately 30 centiMorgans of the short arm of human chromosome 6. Although karyotyping is uncommonly done in patients because of psoriasis, we now seek evidence of translocations of chromosome 6 in association with psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients with advanced HIV infection treated with zidovudine. We wished to determine the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus-related high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and identify factors associated with the development of NHL in patients receiving zidovudine. Data are from a 2-year prospective, observational, multisite study of 1030 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and advanced AIDS-related complex who received zidovudine. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma developed in 24 (2.3%) of 1030 patients who received zidovudine during 1463 person-years of follow-up (rate, 1.6 per 100 person-years of therapy). The relative hazard for development of NHL was stable throughout 2 years of therapy, with the risk of developing NHL 0.8% for each additional 6 months of therapy. Factors associated with development of NHL were a prior diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, herpes simplex virus infection, or lower mean neutrophil count. Less strongly associated was a prior diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia or homosexual transmission of HIV. By Cox proportional hazards analysis, a prior diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, cytomegalovirus disease, or oral hairy leukoplakia was most strongly associated with development of NHL. Our study demonstrates a relatively high incidence of NHL in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease who are undergoing antiretroviral therapy and suggests possible risk factors for development of NHL.",Virus_Diseases
"Tissue kallikrein and kininogen in human sweat glands and psoriatic skin. The cellular localization of immunoreactive tissue kallikrein and kininogen was studied in normal and psoriatic human skin. Immunoreactivity to both enzyme and substrate was observed in secretory granules of the dark cells in the secretory fundus (acinus) of the sweat glands. Double immunostaining revealed a segmental distribution of the two antigens. Each acinar section contained either tissue kallikrein or kininogen. However, there appeared to be a junctional zone in which both were present, but in separate dark cells. Immunoreactivity for both antigens was also observed in close apposition to the luminal microvilli of the duct cells. No specific immunostaining was seen in sebaceous glands, hair follicles, keratinocytes and other cells of the secretory unit such as myoepithelial or clear cells. In psoriatic skin there were in addition many neutrophils immunoreactive for tissue kallikrein in the epidermis and psoriatic scales. Mitogenic action of kinins may account to some extent for the characteristic accelerated turnover of epidermal cells in psoriasis and locally applied kinin antagonists may prove of value in the treatment of this disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"An influenza A virus containing influenza B virus 5' and 3' noncoding regions on the neuraminidase gene is attenuated in mice. Influenza A and B viruses have not been shown to form reassortants. It had been assumed that the lack of genotypic mixing between influenza virus types reflected differences in polymerase and packaging specificity. In this study, we show that an influenza A virus polymerase transcribes and replicates a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene flanked by the nontranslated sequences of an influenza B virus gene. Although the transcription level of this CAT gene was several times lower than that of a CAT gene flanked by the homologous nontranslated sequences of an influenza A virus, we proceeded to construct a chimeric type A/B influenza virus. Using recombinant DNA techniques, a chimeric neuraminidase gene was introduced into the genome of influenza A/WSN/33 virus. The hybrid influenza A/B virus gene contained the coding region of the A/WSN neuraminidase and the 3' and 5' nontranslated sequences of the nonstructural gene of influenza B/Lee virus. The resulting chimeric virus formed plaques in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells but replicated more slowly and achieved lower titers than wild-type influenza A/WSN/33 virus. The chimeric virus was attenuated for mice as indicated by a 400-fold increase in its LD50. Interestingly, the virus was greatly restricted in replication in the upper respiratory tract and partially restricted in the lungs. Animals infected with the transfectant virus were highly resistant to influenza virus challenge. It appears that this chimeric virus has many of the properties desirable for a live attenuated virus vaccine.",Virus_Diseases
"Amputation prevention in an independently reviewed at-risk diabetic population using a comprehensive wound care protocol. An independent review panel composed of an orthopedic surgeon, a vascular surgeon, and an endocrinologist was convened to conduct a case history review. The 71 patients reviewed had 124 wounds on 81 limbs and participated in the comprehensive wound management program of the University of Minnesota. Based on their expertise, the review panel classified the wounds by severity and identified the limb's risk for amputation. The resulting scores were then compared with the patient's actual outcome. The review panel predicted 65 (80%) of the limbs would be salvaged and 16 (20%) would be amputated. The actual outcome was that 75 (93%) of the limbs were salvaged and 6 (7%) were amputated (p less than 0.005). The university's wound management program was highly successful, compared with the predictions of the reviewers.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Cellular basis for rheumatoid inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic idiopathic disease characterized by persistent inflammation of the synovium, local destruction of bone and cartilage, and a variety of systemic manifestations. Although the etiologic stimulus has not been identified, rheumatoid synovitis is characterized by persistent immunologic activity, with CD4(+)/CD29(+) memory T cells prominently involved. Many of the local and systemic manifestations of RA appear to result from the production of a variety of cytokines within the inflamed synovium. A number of other inflammatory mediators produced in the rheumatoid synovium, including arachidonic acid metabolites, vasoactive amines, platelet-activating factor, and complement cleavage products contribute to the inflammatory process. In addition, the local production of immunoglobulin and the autoantibody, rheumatoid factor, along with the local production of immune complexes and complement activation, play a major role in the destructive potential of rheumatoid synovitis. The driving force behind rheumatoid inflammation, however, is likely to be CD4(+) T cells responding to an antigenic epitope in the synovium in an HLA-DR restricted manner. Understanding the immunopathogenic process underlying rheumatoid inflammation should provide insight into approaches to control the disease effectively and specifically.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Reducing HIV sexual risk behaviors among runaway adolescents. OBJECTIVE. Reductions in runaways' sexual risk behaviors were evaluated in response to an intensive program to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN. In a nonrandomized control trial, sexual risk behaviors among 78 runaways at one residential shelter who received up to 30 HIV/AIDS intervention sessions were compared with 67 runaways at a nonintervention shelter with sexual behaviors assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months. SETTING. Runaways were recruited from the only two publicly funded shelters in New York, NY. PARTICIPANTS. The runaways were aged 11 to 18 years, 64% female, and predominantly black or Hispanic. INTERVENTION. The intervention addressed general knowledge about HIV/AIDS, coping skills, access to health care and other resources, and individual barriers to safer sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Consistent condom use, a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior, and sexual abstinence over a 3-month time frame were assessed. MAIN RESULTS. As the number of intervention sessions increased, runaways' reports of consistent condom use increased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .06, P less than .05; at 6 months, unique R2 = .09, P less than .05), and their reports of engaging in a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior decreased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .03, P = .06; at 6 months, unique R2 = .04, P less than .05). Abstinence did not change. CONCLUSIONS. The demonstrated effectiveness of the intensive HIV/AIDS program highlights the importance of enlarging the scope of most current HIV/AIDS prevention programs.",Virus_Diseases

"HTLV-I-associated myelopathy endemic in Texas-born residents and isolation of virus from CSF cells. We report three Texas-born patients with spastic paraparesis and well-documented infection with HTLV-I. CSF examination showed moderate pleocytosis, protein elevation, and elevated IgG index. Oligoclonal bands were present in two patients. On MRI, one patient had frontal lobe lesions that were low intensity on T1- and high intensity on T2-weighted images. HTLV-I immunoblot studies of serum and CSF revealed reactivity to p19, p24, p53, gp46, or gp68 from all three patients. Titration studies of serum and CSF antibodies on ELISA and immunoblot assays indicated an intrathecal virus-specific response. HTLV-I-specific p19 antigen capture assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated HTLV-I in lymphocyte cultures derived from each patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or CSF cells. Using HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-specific pol and gag primers, PCR studies of PBMC cells obtained directly from the patients demonstrated that the patients were infected with HTLV-I and not HTLV-II. These three cases are to our knowledge the only US cases in whom virus isolation from the CSF has been accomplished. Importantly, two patients may be the first US cases of myelopathy arising from endemic infection.",Virus_Diseases

"Vascular and nonvascular expression of INCAM-110. A target for mononuclear leukocyte adhesion in normal and inflamed human tissues. Inducible cell adhesion molecule 110 (INCAM-110), is a 110-kd adhesion receptor for lymphocytes and monocytes identified on cytokine-activated endothelium. Using immunoperoxidase techniques, little or no INCAM-110 was detected on endothelium in normal human tissues. In contrast, INCAM-110 was expressed in postcapillary venules in a variety of active inflammatory processes. In acute appendicitis, INCAM-110 was found coincident with strong expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1), a cytokine-inducible molecule that functions in neutrophil adhesion. However, in certain chronic inflammatory processes (eg, sarcoidosis), INCAM-110 was observed without simultaneous ELAM-1 expression. Anti-INCAM-110 antibody E1/6 also marked several extravascular cell types, including lymphoid dendritic cells, some tissue macrophages, synovial lining cells, and reactive mesothelial cells. These data suggest a role for endothelial INCAM-110 in the pathophysiology of both acute and chronic inflammatory reactions. Furthermore INCAM-110 may function as an adhesion molecule for mononuclear leukocytes in a variety of extravascular sites.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis presenting as ulcerodestructive gastrointestinal tract lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. A new association. We describe cases of severe odynophagia, extensive oral ulcerations, and bowel perforation in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection that were caused by lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Such presentations in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals are usually ascribed to other causes and may be incorrectly treated on an empiric basis. In addition, deep tissue specimens obtained at the margin of ulcerative lesions are often necessary for definitive diagnosis. We review our limited treatment experience with zidovudine, interferon alfa, and H2 blockers in our patients. Based on the markedly increased frequency in which lymphomatoid granulomatosis is being diagnosed at our institution in the post-human immunodeficiency virus era, we postulated an association between these two entities.",Virus_Diseases
"Induction of lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis by autologous serum. In the present study various factors which contribute to the initiation of lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) were examined. Thirty-one patients with DH, seven with bullous pemphigoid, two with linear IgA disease and two healthy subjects were studied either before starting treatment or after stopping dapsone for up to 5 days. Intradermal inoculation of freshly prepared autologous serum was followed after 18-24 h by the formation of DH-like lesions in 24/31 DH patients. The lesions were erythematous papules, often with vesicles and microscopically showed papillary tip microabscesses. Serum-induced formation of lesions only occurred in patients with active DH with some spontaneous lesion formation: it did not occur in any of the non-DH controls. The formation of lesions was dose-related, declining proportionately with dilution of the serum down to 1/16. Plasma prepared by various methods of anticoagulation (heparin, citrate, EDTA) caused lesser reactions, while addition of heparin or epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA), but not citrate, to serum substantially inhibited the formation of lesions. This suggested the responsible factor might be a protease. Other vasoactive agents including histamine (1-4 micrograms) and compound 48/80 (1-5 micrograms) caused normal immediate wealing. DH-like lesions occurred in only one of 13 subjects challenged with histamine and two of nine challenged with 48/80. In all these, autologous serum elicited large vesicular responses. There is a factor(s) in serum in DH which can initiate the formation of lesions. This factor appears to be activated by clotting and can be inhibited by heparin and EACA, suggesting it may be a protease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Comparison of quantitative sensory-threshold measures for their association with foot ulceration in diabetic patients. We compared the accuracy of cutaneous pressure perception-threshold measurements with that of other sensory-threshold measurements for detecting diabetic foot ulcer patients. Three hundred fourteen non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients were studied, of whom 91 had either a current foot ulcer or a history of foot ulceration. Foot ulcer patients had much higher pressure perception thresholds at the hallux than those without foot ulcers (mean +/- SE 4.63 +/- 0.05 vs. 3.54 +/- 0.04 U, P less than 0.001). The magnitude of association was higher than that for vibration thresholds and markedly greater than those for cool and warm thresholds. Pressure thresholds were highly accurate for identifying foot ulcer patients. At a threshold level of 4.21 U, the sensitivity was 0.84, with a specificity of 0.96. At similar sensitivities for vibration and thermal thresholds, specificities were lower. Foot ulceration and cutaneous pressure perception threshold are strongly associated. Pressure-threshold measurements are extremely accurate and perform at least as well as other quantitative sensory tests in identifying foot ulcer patients. Assessment of the foot pressure threshold may have promise as a simple and inexpensive method for detecting diabetic patients at risk for foot ulcers.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Total knee arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis. A comparison of the polycentric and total condylar prostheses. From 1971 to 1985, 393 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were performed in patients for rheumatoid arthritis. Of these, 112 used polycentric prostheses and 131 used total condylar prostheses. One hundred seven of the patients with polycentric prostheses and 102 of the patients with total condylar prostheses were followed for a minimum of two years (average, 61 and 55 months, respectively). At the time of the latest examination, nine knees with polycentric prostheses required revision surgery: six for tibial component loosening and instability and three for patellofemoral pain. Five knees with total condylar prostheses required revision: one for chronic instability, one for a late posttraumatic patellar fracture, and three for late hematogenous infections. The total condylar prostheses with patellar resurfacing had better scores for pain (8.5 points) than the polycentric prosthesis without patellofemoral resurfacing (7.0 points). The total condylar prosthesis appeared more durable in terms of fixation, with no evidence of aseptic loosening of femoral or tibial components noted in this series thus far.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: relation to liver fibrosis and arthritis. Levels of serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen were measured in 170 patients with psoriasis (49% with coexistent psoriatic arthritis) who had liver biopsies performed during or before treatment with methotrexate or, in some cases, with retinoids. Psoriasis patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis in their liver biopsy specimens had a significantly higher mean serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen than did patients without fibrosis and without arthritis. Only 4% of patients without cirrhosis or fibrosis and no arthritis had an elevated serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen. In contrast, 38% of patients with psoriatic arthritis had an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of detectable liver fibrosis. It is concluded that the number of liver biopsies performed on methotrexate-treated psoriasis patients with or without arthritis may be reduced to a minimum as long as serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen is normal. Increased serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of arthritis is a strong indicator of liver fibrogenesis and suggests the need for liver biopsy to monitor possible methotrexate-induced toxicity. In patients with psoriatic arthritis an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen may be related to the joint disease. Patients with psoriatic arthritis and increased levels of aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen should therefore follow the established guidelines for the use of methotrexate in psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Direct immunofluorescence microscopy of 1 mol/L sodium chloride-treated patient skin. Patients with bullous pemphigoid and those with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita often demonstrate virtually identical clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic features. Although some patients can be distinguished by their pattern of circulating IgG anti-basement membrane zone antibody binding to 1 mol/L sodium chloride-split human skin, approximately 20% and 50% of bullous pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita patients, respectively, do not possess such antibodies. Hence this study sought to determine whether these patients can be distinguished by mapping the distribution of basement membrane zone immunoreactants in patient skin split in vitro by 1 mol/L sodium chloride. All sodium chloride-treated samples from patients with bullous pemphigoid (n = 8), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (n = 4), or other bullous skin diseases (n = 6) contained a lamina lucida cleavage plane bounded by bullous pemphigoid antigen and laminin; moreover, treatment of patient samples was performed without loss of tissue substrate or in situ immunoreactants. Deposits of IgG were found on the epidermal side of sodium chloride-treated skin from 13 of 14 bullous pemphigoid samples; IgG deposits in bullous pemphigoid samples were exclusively epidermal in eight, epidermal and dermal in five, and solely dermal in one. In contrast, IgG was found exclusively on the dermal side of sodium chloride-treated samples from patients with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Although IgG mapping distinguished bullous pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita patients in 94% of these samples, the distribution of C3 in sodium chloride-treated patient skin was more variable and less predictive diagnostically.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Circulating Epstein-Barr virus-carrying B cells in acute malaria. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and Plasmodium falciparum malaria are two known cofactors in the aetiology of endemic Burkitt's lymphoma. To assess the relation between these factors, limiting dilution analysis was used to assess the number of EBV-carrying B cells in the circulation of Gambian children during and after acute malaria. Numbers of virus-carrying cells were five times higher in acute malaria patients and in UK patients with infectious mononucleosis than in convalescent malaria patients and in healthy control adults from the UK. Spontaneous outgrowth in limiting dilution cultures from acute malaria samples was inhibited by acyclovir, a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor. The mechanism of outgrowth, therefore, was virus release from the in-vivo infected cell, which led to infection and immortalisation of co-cultured normal B cells. The findings provide evidence that acute malaria is associated with an increase in the number of EBV-carrying B cells in the circulation. Because of this increase, there is a greater chance of a cytogenetic abnormality occurring in such a cell, with consequent evolution of Burkitt's lymphoma.",Virus_Diseases
"Primary central nervous system lymphoma in patients with and without the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A retrospective analysis and review of the literature. Twenty-two cases of PCL were reviewed, in which 9 patients had AIDS and 13 did not. A review of the literature identified 247 cases of AIDS-related PCL. Differences between patients with AIDS and immunocompetent PCL were noted in our series. AIDS-related PCL when compared to non-AIDS PCL in our series has the following notable clinical features: 1) significantly younger age at presentation, median age 34 versus 59 years; 2) significantly higher incidence of B symptoms, 44% versus 8%; 3) worse median performance status at presentation, 3 versus 1; and, 4) shorter median survival, 3 versus 10 months. Differences in performance status and survival, however, were not significant. AIDS-related PCL is further characterized by frequent (44%) ring-enhancing mass lesions on head CT scan, a finding that makes it clinically difficult to distinguish from toxoplasmosis. Median survival appears to be improved in the absence of opportunistic infection at time of diagnosis of PCL, 6 versus 2 months. The therapeutic approach to patients with PCL, with and without AIDS, is variable. Combined modality therapy may improve the survival in patients with non-AIDS PCL. Therapy for patients with AIDS-related PCL is tailored to the status of the individual and it is, therefore, difficult to make comparisons to non-AIDS PCL patients. AIDS patients are often too ill to tolerate aggressive surgery or systemic treatment and in this instance, radiotherapy alone may be an acceptable alternative. Nonetheless, overall survival for patients with AIDS-related and non-AIDS PCL remains poor.",Virus_Diseases
"Influence of host genotype on progression to AIDS among HIV-infected men. To evaluate whether host genotype influences disease progression among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), molecular techniques were used to determine genotypes at immune response loci for 114 HIV-1-infected homosexual/bisexual white men in the San Francisco Men's Health Study. Candidate genes evaluated were HLA-DQA1 and -DRB1, complement C4A and C4B, alpha- and beta-interferons, and the heavy chain of immunoglobulin gamma 1. Of the 114 men, 29 were asymptomatic, 21 were symptomatic men and AIDS patients (p = 0.02). Specifically, the HLA haplotype DRB1*0702-DQA1*0201 was associated with absence of symptoms (p = 0.003). Conversely, the frequency of the complement C4B-L allele was higher among patients with symptoms or with AIDS than among asymptomatic subjects (p = 0.02). These results suggest that genes in or near the major histocompatibility complex may influence the rate of disease progression among HIV-1-infected men.",Virus_Diseases
"Comparison of 1 or 3 MU of interferon alfa-2b and placebo in patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Ninety patients with histologically documented chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis were randomly allocated to receive SC injections of placebo or of 1 or 3 MU of recombinant interferon alfa-2b three times weekly for 24 weeks. Complete normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels occurred posttreatment in 43.3% of patients receiving 3 MU, in 20% of those receiving 1 MU, and in 6.7% of untreated patients (P less than 0.0005 vs. those treated with 3 MU). Alanine aminotransferase normalization was sustained for 6 months after therapy in 13.3% of the patients treated with 3 MU and in 3.3% of those given 1 MU or placebo. The decline of alanine aminotransferase levels following interferon therapy showed independent, positive correlations with female sex (P less than 0.03) and younger age (P less than 0.05). The Knodell's fibrosis score was strongly positively correlated with age (P less than 0.0001). It is concluded that 3 MU of interferon is a more effective dose than 1 MU for controlling disease activity in non-A, non-B chronic hepatitis patients.

"Infection of Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with dengue parent and progeny candidate vaccine viruses: a possible marker of human attenuation. Dengue (DEN-1) and DEN-4 parent (P) and progeny candidate vaccine (CV) viruses were compared in their abilities to infect and to replicate in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The DEN CV clones were temperature sensitive (ts) and had small plaque morphology. The DEN-1 and DEN-4 CV viruses differed in their ability to infect, to replicate in, and to be transmitted by mosquitoes. The DEN-1 CV virus was not attenuated for the vector mosquitoes; oral infection rates with the CV virus were as high as or higher than the P virus, and the CV virus replicated efficiently in mosquitoes after oral infection. The DEN-4 CV virus was attenuated; it was less efficient than its P virus in infection and replication in mosquitoes. Thus, the ts phenotype and small plaque morphology are not reliable biological markers for prediction of vector attenuation. Similar results were reported by others for attenuation in man and monkeys. These studies with DEN-1 and DEN-4 viruses, and previously reported studies with DEN-2 virus and with DEN-3 virus suggest that vector and vertebrate host attenuation are genetically linked. Thus, vector attenuation may be a biological marker for human attenuation.",Virus_Diseases

"Use of polymerase chain reaction for successful identification of asymptomatic genital infection with herpes simplex virus in pregnant women at delivery. The polymerase chain reaction was adapted to the amplification of a herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA sequence, common to HSV types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2). The amplified product was detectable by ethidium-bromide staining or Southern hybridization of gels and by dot hybridization. The HSV polymerase chain reaction detected HSV DNA in samples obtained from eight patients with genital lesions from which HSV-2 was isolated in tissue culture and from four patients with labial lesions from which HSV-1 was isolated. The HSV polymerase chain reaction identified HSV in clinical specimens obtained from 11 women who had asymptomatic genital HSV infections at delivery. None of 11 samples obtained at delivery from women who had antibodies to HSV-2, but whose delivery cultures were negative, were positive by polymerase chain reaction and no false-positive reactions were obtained when the reaction mixture contained human cell DNA or varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, or human papillomavirus DNA.",Virus_Diseases
"Hypophospholipasemia A2 in systemic sclerosis. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), total and pancreatic, were quantitated in 91 sera of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The mean total PLA2 of 216 +/- 161 U/ml (SD) was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than in controls (317 +/- 128 U/ml). In 55 of 91 patients (60%) PLA2 was more than 1 SD and in 6 (7%) more than 2 SD below the normal mean. Serum pancreatic PLA2 was also significantly lower in SSc. The prevalence of low serum total PLA2 was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) than in healthy adults, or in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis. Repeat assays of PLA2 activity in 10 patients with SSc documented persistence of low PLA2. Among 76 patients with SSc with complete clinical and laboratory assessment, there were 48 with low and 28 with normal (or slightly elevated) PLA2. These 2 groups showed no differences in disease manifestation or therapy. The group with low serum PLA2 had lower erythrocyte sedimentation rates (p less than 0.0005) and lower neutrophil (p less than 0.05) and monocyte counts (p less than 0.025) in the peripheral blood. The finding of low serum PLA2 activity adds to the spectrum of arachidonic acid pathway abnormalities associated with SSc, and may in part be related to the paucity of inflammatory changes observed in this disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Urticaria: current therapy. Although the ideal treatment for urticaria is identification and removal of its cause, no underlying cause can be discerned in the majority of instances. The chief clinical problem is the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. H1-receptor antagonists are the major class of therapeutic agents used in the management of chronic idiopathic urticaria. The H1 antagonists have been divided into subgroups based on their chemical structure. The second-generation H1 antagonists now available are particularly advantageous for individuals who must remain alert while working. Terbutaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, is of occasional benefit as an adjunct therapy in combination with an H1 antagonist. The oral administration of disodium cromoglycate is ineffective in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, although a few individuals with urticaria caused by food allergy may respond to this drug. It is best to avoid repeated injections of epinephrine and the systemic administration of corticosteroids. Urticaria has a capricious course: it may respond to the administration of placebos or it may resolve spontaneously. About 50% of the patients with urticaria are free of lesions within 1 year, but 20% continue to have episodes for more than 20 years.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Cytokines in chronic inflammatory arthritis. V. Mutual antagonism between interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha on HLA-DR expression, proliferation, collagenase production, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor production by rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytes. The effects of a broad array of cytokines, individually and in combination, were determined on separate functions (proliferation, collagenase production, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] production) and phenotype (expression of class II MHC antigens) of cultured fibroblast-like RA synoviocytes. The following recombinant cytokines were used: IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, GM-CSF, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Only IFN-gamma induced HLA-DR (but not HLA-DQ) expression. TNF-alpha inhibited IFN-gamma-mediated HLA-DR expression (46.7 +/- 4.1% inhibition) and HLA-DR mRNA accumulation. This inhibitory effect was also observed in osteoarthritis synoviocytes. Only TNF-alpha and IL-1 increased synoviocyte proliferation (stimulation index 3.60 +/- 1.03 and 2.31 +/- 0.46, respectively). IFN-gamma (but none of the other cytokines) inhibited TNF-alpha-induced proliferation (70 +/- 14% inhibition) without affecting the activity of IL-1. Only IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha induced collagenase production (from less than 0.10 U/ml to 1.10 +/- 0.15 and 0.72 +/- 0.24, respectively). IFN-gamma decreased TNF-alpha-mediated collagenase production (69 +/- 19% inhibition) and GM-CSF production but had no effect on the action of IL-1. These data demonstrate mutual antagonism between IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha on fibroblast-like synoviocytes and suggest a novel homeostatic control mechanism that might be defective in RA where very little IFN-gamma is produced.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Immunopathology of cicatricial pemphigoid affecting the conjunctiva. Conjunctival biopsy specimens from 13 patients with cicatricial pemphigoid and from 13 age-matched healthy individuals undergoing cataract surgery were analyzed by light microscopy and immunohistochemical techniques, including a panel of monoclonal antibodies used to characterize inflammatory mononuclear cell phenotypes. Results of histologic examination of cicatricial pemphigoid specimens showed typical squamous metaplasia, vasculopathy, increased numbers of mast cells, and abundant plasma cells. All cicatricial pemphigoid specimens demonstrated immunoreactants at the epithelial basement membrane zone (BMZ). Epithelium of cicatricial pemphigoid conjunctiva showed significantly more T-helper cells (CD4+), dendritic cells (CD1+), and macrophages (CD14+), and a significantly higher helper/suppressor ratio than did controls. In the substantia propria, pemphigoid specimens showed dramatically increased inflammatory infiltrate with significantly more cells staining, in order of frequency, for T cells (CD3+, CD5+), T-helper cells (CD4+), T-suppressor cells (CD8+), macrophages (CD14+, Mac-1+), and dendritic cells (CD1+, HLA-DR+).

"Hepatocellular carcinoma in Italian patients with cirrhosis  BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are recognized as being at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. The magnitude of the risk, the natural history of this disease, and the possibilities for detecting potentially curable tumors in patients in the Western world are unknown. To address these questions, we examined 447 Italian patients with well-compensated cirrhosis (which was of viral origin in 62 percent of them) from 1985 through 1990, performing serum alpha-fetoprotein assays and real-time ultrasonography every 3 to 12 months. RESULTS. Hepatocellular carcinoma was found in 30 patients (7 percent) at base line and in another 29 patients (7 percent of 417 patients free of tumor at base line) during follow-up periods averaging 33 months (range, 1 to 48). The cumulative hazard of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up was higher among patients with persistently elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (12 with tumors among 42 with such levels) than among those with fluctuating levels (11 among 82) or those with consistently normal levels (6 among 255). Only 17 patients had potentially operable tumors. The proportion of potentially operable tumors among those detected during follow-up was significantly lower than the proportion at enrollment (4 of 29 vs. 13 of 30, P = 0.027). The survival at one year of the 12 patients who underwent surgery was 67 percent, and the tumor-recurrence rate was 60 percent. Outcome was not appreciably different for the five patients who refused surgery. CONCLUSIONS. In the West, as in Asia, patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at substantial risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, with a yearly incidence rate of 3 percent. Our screening program did not appreciably increase the rate of detection of potentially curable tumors.",Virus_Diseases

"Protection from chemotherapy-induced alopecia in a rat model. Alopecia (hair loss) is among the most distressing side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Little progress has been made, however, in its prevention or treatment, partly because of the lack of suitable experimental model. In recent work on the treatment of myelogenous leukemia in the rat, the following observations were made: (i) treatment of 8-day-old rats with cytosine arabinoside consistently produced alopecia, and (ii) ImuVert, a biologic response modifier derived from the bacterium Serratia marcescens, uniformly produced complete protection against the alopecia. In subsequent experiments, both cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin also produced alopecia in this model, and the doxorubicin-induced alopecia was prevented by treatment with ImuVert. The potential relevance of these observations to chemotherapy-induced alopecia in the clinical setting should be examined.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Cyclosporin A suppresses ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelium in healing psoriatic plaques. To analyze the mode of action of Cyclosporin A (CsA) in psoriasis, we examined the phenotypic profile of resident and passenger skin cells in seven psoriatic patients before and after 2 weeks of CsA treatment using a large panel of monoclonal antibodies in a three-step immunoperoxidase technique. For comparison, skin biopsies from psoriatic patients receiving psoralen + UVA (PUVA) therapy were examined. Although both treatment protocols were equally effective in inducing resolution of psoriatic lesions, the phenotypic changes induced by CsA differed greatly from those seen after PUVA. In CsA-treated patients there was a dramatic reduction in the ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelial cells, but density, pattern, and phenotype of infiltrating inflammatory cells remained essentially unchanged. In contrast, PUVA therapy had no visible effect on ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelial cells, but resulted in a significant reduction of the hemopoietic resident and infiltrating mononuclear cells within the epidermis. These results favor, but do not prove, the assumption that the CsA regimen chosen in this study exerts its anti-psoriatic effect primarily at the level of the keratinocyte, i.e., by inhibiting events leading to keratinocyte proliferation as well as by interfering with the secretion of mediators responsible for ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelial cells.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Autoantibodies to nucleolar antigens in systemic scleroderma: clinical correlations.

Forty-nine of the sera were from 296 patients with systemic scleroderma (SSc) and 15 sera were from 214 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A homogeneous nucleolar staining pattern was found in 45 of the 64 sera (70.3%), a clumpy fluorescence associated with fibrillarin antibody in 14 (21.8%) and a speckled pattern was found in five of the sera (7.8%). There was a clear correlation between the sera which showed a homogeneous nucleolar staining pattern with symptoms of the polymyositis/scleroderma overlap syndrome that differed from SSc with concomitant myositis. The clumpy pattern was mainly associated with diffuse scleroderma and the speckled pattern with limited scleroderma (previously called acrosclerosis).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hereditary coproporphyria: an imitator of multiple sclerosis. Hereditary coproporphyria can cause both peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system abnormalities. There are several similarities between multiple sclerosis and hereditary coproporphyria that are probably due to the central nervous system dysfunction present in both. This report describes a 62-year-old man with a five-year history of progressive paraparesis initially diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. Supporting evidence for the diagnosis of a demyelinating disease included three oligoclonal bands in the patient's cerebral spinal fluid, a prolonged visual evoked response bilaterally, abnormal sensory evoked potentials, and an area of increased signal in the posterior cervical cord suggestive of demyelination that was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Features atypical for multiple sclerosis were hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes, electromyographic evidence of peripheral neuropathy, and severe constipation. Elevated urine porphyrins and decreased levels of coproporphyrinogen oxidase confirmed the correct diagnosis of hereditary coproporphyria. The patient improved after being placed on a high-carbohydrate diet.

"Human T cell lymphotropic virus infection in Guaymi Indians from Panama. Preliminary studies found that 9% of Guaymi Indians from Bocas del Toro province have antibody to human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I/II). The present study enrolled 317 (21% of the population) Guaymi Indians from Changuinola, the capital of Bocas del Toro province and 333 (70% of the population) from Canquintu, an isolated rural village. Demographic information and family relationships were ascertained and subjects were screened for neurologic diseases. Serum specimens were screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HTLV-I/II antibody and positives were confirmed according to U.S. Public Health Service criteria. Twenty-five (8%) Guaymi residing in Changuinola and 7 (2.1%) from Canquintu were confirmed seropositive. In Changuinola, antibody was virtually limited to residents greater than or equal to 15 years of age (24 [16%] of 153) and rates were slightly higher in males than in females; in Canquintu, antibody rates did not increase significantly with age and appeared higher in females than in males. In Changuinola, there was no evidence for household clustering of infection. In contrast, HTLV antibody among Canquintu residents clustered significantly by household. HTLV-associated neurologic disease was not detected in either population. The atypical seroepidemiology observed in both locations might be explained if the virus endemic to the Guaymi differed from HTLV-I previously described in the Caribbean basin and Japan.",Virus_Diseases
"Effectiveness of histopathological diagnoses in dysfunction of hepatic transplantation. Review of 146 histopathological studies from 53 transplants. In 47 patients who underwent 53 liver transplantations and immunosuppression with cyclosporine (cyclosporin A), methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and antithymocyte globulin, 146 histopathological studies were performed (138 biopsies, six hepatectomies, and two autopsies). The following microscopical diagnoses were made: 43 acute rejections (29.4%), six chronic rejections (4.1%), 18 liver blood perfusion changes (12.3%), 15 biliary changes (10.2%), 10 cases of functional cholestasis (6.8%), two drug reactions (1.3%), two hepatitis B virus recurrences (1.3%), 11 opportunistic viral infections (7.5%), 18 minimal changes (12.3%), two nonclassifiable changes (1.3%), and 19 plurietiological changes (13%). A histopathological diagnosis of acute rejection was made in 31 transplants (58.4%). In 22 (71%) of them, acute rejection was diagnosed with the protocol biopsy specimen that was obtained during the second posttransplant week. Leukocyte counts and serum bilirubin and enzyme levels were obtained on the same day that the hepatic biopsy specimens were taken. There was no significant statistical difference between the mean serum data that accompanied each histopathological diagnosis, allowing identification of a characteristic biochemical profile for the causes of graft dysfunction. We report a detailed description of the microscopical findings of each diagnosis and the following conclusions: (1) Acute rejection is the most frequent cause of hepatic dysfunction and has an early appearance during the posttransplant period. (2) Histopathological findings can identify the causes of the dysfunction. (3) There is no specific biochemical pattern to differentiate these causes. This may be due to the frequent combination of etiological factors in every dysfunction episode.",Virus_Diseases

"Experience with a transfusion recipient education program about hepatitis C. Shortly after test kits for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) were licensed in May of 1990, our medical community undertook a public education program encouraging previous transfusion recipients to see their physicians about the wisdom of being tested for anti-HCV. In response, 1034 samples were received for testing. All samples repeatably reactive (RR) with anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) were tested further with a research recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). Overall, 76 of the 1034 (7.4%) recipient samples were RR and 64 of these (84.2%) were reactive with RIBA. Recipients transfused prior to surrogate testing (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and anti-hepatitis B core [anti-HBc]) in 1986 showed a 8.6 percent reactivity with RIBA and those transfused after surrogate testing showed a 4.8 percent reactivity, a 44 percent reduction. Of the 57 recipient samples reactive with RIBA and suitable for assay, 11 (19.3%) had an elevated ALT. Among 76 randomly selected blood donors with RR EIAs studied for comparison with recipients, 20 (26.3%) were reactive with RIBA, 9 of which had an abnormal surrogate test that would have disqualified them. ALT concentrations were abnormal in 6 (30%) of the donors who were reactive on RIBA. We conclude that an education program that encourages previous transfusion recipients to seek medical advice about anti-HCV testing is practical from the standpoint of the blood center. We believe more widespread implementation of similar programs should be considered.",Virus_Diseases
"Topical nitrogen mustard: an effective treatment for cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis. In 16 children with multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (mean age 22 months, range 5 to 36 months) severe symptomatic skin involvement was treated with topical nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine hydrochloride). In each case, rapid clinical improvement occurred within 10 days; subsequent complete healing was observed in 14 children, and partial healing in 2 others in whom treatment was a component of palliative care. Mean duration of treatment was 3.5 months (range 2 to 6 months). Systemic treatment was averted in 11 patients because response to topical therapy was so favorable, but bone marrow or respiratory failure led to a fatal outcome in 5 other patients. Adverse effects were minimal. One patient developed contact allergy to topical nitrogen mustard after 2 years of intermittent therapy, but was successfully desensitized and was then able to continue treatment.

"Atopic dermatitis: new therapeutic considerations. Atopic dermatitis is a genetically determined inflammatory condition in which the primary defect is expressed in one or more hematopoietic cells that infiltrate the skin. It is a multifactorial disease with inflammation triggered by a variety of factors. Among these, atopic dermatitis has been experimentally induced and reproduced by emotional-stress interviews and food challenges only. The inflammatory events of atopic dermatitis appear to initiated by mast cells, but eosinophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes (predominantly CD4) also are present in lesions. The secondary effects of inflammation are a dry, brittle stratum corneum and pruritus, causing excoriation and a lichenified epidermal layer resulting from chronic rubbing. Therapeutic approaches to atopic dermatitis may be directed at several points in the evolution of the disease. Agents including emollients are needed to preserve and restore the stratum corneum barrier, and effective antipruritics are required to reduce the self-inflicted damage to the involved skin. Various other agents may be needed to antagonize mediators or cytokines and to inhibit cytokine expression and release from lesional, immune-effector cells. Likewise, new phosphodiesterase inhibitors, calcium-active agents, and antiallergic drugs may be used to reduce the quantity and pathologic functioning of inflammatory infiltrating cells in the skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Predictors of survival in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). We conducted followup of 264 patients with definite systemic sclerosis (SSc) who were entered into the multicenter Scleroderma Criteria Cooperative Study (SCCS) during 1973-1977. At the end of the study (average 5.2 years of followup), 38% were known to be alive, 50% were dead (68% of these deaths definitely related to SSc), and 12% were lost to followup. Survival analyses of 484 demographic, clinical, and laboratory items recorded at entry into the SCCS (within 2 years of physician diagnosis of SSc) were performed. Survival declined linearly, and the cumulative survival rate was less than 80% at 2 years, 50% at 8.5 years, and 30% at 12 years after entry. Analysis using combinations of entry variables identifying organ system involvement confirmed that renal, cardiac, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal involvement in SSc predicted reduced survival; however, data on organ system involvement at study entry could not be used to consistently predict which organ system would ultimately be involved as the primary cause of death. By survival tree analysis, the individual entry variables best predicting reduced survival included older age (greater than 64 years), reduced renal function (blood urea nitrogen greater than 16 mg/dl), anemia (hemoglobin less than or equal to 11 gm/dl), reduced pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (less than or equal to 50% of predicted), reduced total serum protein level (less than or equal to 6 gm/dl), and reduced pulmonary reserve (forced vital capacity less than 80% with hemoglobin greater than 14 gm/dl or forced vital capacity less than 65% with hemoglobin less than or equal to 14 gm/dl). Cox proportional hazards model analysis confirmed these results. Different combinations of variables led to markedly different survival rates. The poorest prospects for survival were in patients with SSc who were less than or equal to 64 years old with a hemoglobin level less than or equal to 11 gm/dl, and in those greater than 64 years old with a blood urea nitrogen level greater than 16 mg/dl.

"Pearly penile papules: absence of human papillomavirus DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Pearly penile papules clinically resemble the sexually transmitted papular variant of genital condylomata. Histologically, however, pearly penile papules consist of fibropapillomata that lack the characteristic morphologic features of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. To study the possible association of HPV infections with pearly penile papules, we examined tissue specimens from 13 men with pearly penile papules with and without associated penile condylomata. Biopsy specimens were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. None of the pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA sequences, whereas four of seven cases clinically suspected of being condylomata associated with pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA. These results confirm that pearly penile papule lesions do not contain HPV DNA; therefore, the distinction between pearly penile papules and penile condylomata is clinically significant.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

A quantitative analysis of T cells and T-cell subsets, B cells, natural killer cells, interleukin-2 receptor-positive cells, and macrophages was performed on serial sections from all the specimens. Localization of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and -II antigens, alpha and gamma interferon, and HIV antigens (p24, gp120, and gp41) was performed using specific antisera. In specimens from HIV-positive and seronegative patients, the predominant cell population was CD8+ cells and macrophages invading or surrounding healthy muscle fibers that expressed MHC-I antigen on their surface. The endomysial infiltrates in specimens from HIV-positive patients differed from those seen in specimens from the seronegative patients only by a significant reduction of the CD4+ cells (12.6 +/- 3.2% versus 21.1 +/- 4.2%). HIV antigens were seen in occasional interstitial mononuclear cells (but not in muscle fibers) in 6 of the 21 specimens from HIV-positive patients. Interferon was not localized. We conclude that the development of HIV-associated polymyositis does not appear to be related to direct infection of the muscle fibers by HIV but rather is due to a T-cell-mediated and MHC-I-restricted cytotoxic process, perhaps triggered by HIV. Because this immunopathological mechanism is common in both HIV-associated polymyositis and polymyositis alone, it is suggested that viruses may also be responsible in triggering polymyositis.",Virus_Diseases
"Intramuscular gold therapy is associated with long survival in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To investigate whether the premature death of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was associated with intramuscular (im) gold treatment or side effects due to gold, a sample of 573 adult patients with RA treated at hospital for the first time during 1961-66 was retrospectively studied for the duration and side effects of im gold treatment as well as death and causes of death. By 1989 a total of 251 patients had died. Gold treatment was not associated with premature death. On the contrary, longterm gold treatment was associated with a high survival rate. Secondary amyloidosis was diagnosed in 28 out of 63 patients, who had gold associated renal disease and who died.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Perinatal transmission of HIV-1: lack of impact of maternal HIV infection on characteristics of livebirths and on neonatal mortality in Kigali, Rwanda. We present the baseline results of a prospective cohort study on the perinatal transmission of HIV-1 in Kigali, Rwanda. HIV-1-antibody testing was offered to all women of urban origin delivering a live newborn at the maternity ward of the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali from November 1988 to June 1989; 218 newborns of 215 HIV-positive mothers were matched to 218 newborns of 216 HIV-negative mothers. The matching criteria were maternal age and parity. No differences in socioeconomic characteristics were observed between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. HIV-positive mothers more frequently reported a history of at least one death of a previously born child (P less than 0.01) and a history of abortion (P less than 0.001). Most of the HIV-positive women were asymptomatic, but 72.4% of them had a CD4; CD8 ratio less than 1 versus 10.1% in the HIV-negative group (P less than 0.001). The frequency of signs and symptoms was not statistically different in the two groups, except for a history of herpes zoster or chronic cough, which was more frequent among HIV-positive women. The rates of prematurity, low birth weight, congenital malformations and neonatal mortality were comparable in the two groups. However, infants of HIV-positive mothers had a mean birth weight 130 g lower than the infants of HIV-negative mothers (P less than 0.01). The impact of maternal HIV-1 infection on the infant seems limited during the neonatal period.",Virus_Diseases
"Detection of HIV-1 DNA in crude cell lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the polymerase chain reaction and nonradioactive oligonucleotide probes. The aim of this study was to detect HIV-1 proviral DNA in lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization with a nonradioactive probe. PBMCs were lysed in 1% Triton X-100. PCR was then carried out using primers complementary to a conserved region of the HIV-1 pol gene. Bracket and nested amplification protocols were used. Products were identified by dot-blot hybridization or agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization, using an alkaline phosphatase-linked oligonucleotide probe specific for amplified sequences. Colorimetric and chemiluminescent substrates were used. HIV-1 DNA was detected in PBMCs of 57/59 HIV-1-seropositive individuals, 8 of which were positive only following the use of nested primers. Of 12 seropositive samples that were negative by other HIV-1 diagnostic tests (PBMC coculture and serum p24 antigen detection), 11 were positive by PCR. PCR using PBMC lysates is a very sensitive method of detecting HIV-1 proviral sequences. The use of nested primers appears to increase the sensitivity of the procedure.",Virus_Diseases
"Definition of an epitope and MHC class I molecule recognized by gag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys. Infection of macaque monkeys with the simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac) results in disease similar to human AIDS. Therefore, the macaque monkey is proving to be an important model for testing the effectiveness of various AIDS vaccine approaches. A detailed analysis of the cellular immune responses is necessary for the evaluation of candidate vaccines. However, this has not been possible in macaques, due, in part, to the unknown nature of the MHC molecules that restrict their T lymphocytes. In our report we demonstrate that a particular MHC class I molecule involved in the rhesus monkey's effector T lymphocyte response to SIVmac is expressed at a high frequency in a colony of rhesus monkeys. SIVmac-infected monkeys that express this MHC class I molecule all develop CTL that are restricted by that molecule and recognize an identical nine amino acid epitope of the SIVmac gag protein. This MHC class I molecule has been defined as an HLA-A homolog by cDNA cloning and sequencing. It has also been expressed in an MHC class I-deficient cell line to demonstrate directly the cloned molecule's capacity to bind and present peptide Ag to CTL. These studies illustrate that AIDS virus-specific CTL can be characterized in detail in the rhesus monkey and lay the foundation for exploring novel approaches to AIDS virus vaccination in this species.",Virus_Diseases
"Systemic hydrocortisone/cortisol induces allergic skin reactions in presensitized subjects. To determine whether systemic hydrocortisone can elicit allergic skin reactions in patients with contact hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone, we studied four patients with contact hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate and two patients with contact hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone-17-butyrate but not to hydrocortisone. Open oral provocation with 100 or 250 mg hydrocortisone in patients with hydrocortisone contact hypersensitivity elicited cutaneous reactions at sites of previous allergic dermatitis caused by hydrocortisone in two patients and at sites of earlier allergic patch test reactions caused by hydrocortisone in the other two patients. Provocations in two patients with contact hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone-17-butyrate but not to hydrocortisone remained negative. To determine whether the adrenal cortical hormone cortisol, which is identical to hydrocortisone, could induce similar skin reactions, one patient with hydrocortisone contact hypersensitivity underwent adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tests; as a control, one hydrocortisone-sensitive patient underwent analogous provocations with placebo. After an 8-hour infusion with the adrenocorticotropic hormone analog tetracosactide, a similar skin reaction to that seen with oral hydrocortisone was observed, whereas provocations with placebo remained negative. We conclude that both oral hydrocortisone and intrinsic cortisol are able to induce allergic skin reactions in presensitized subjects.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Neocortical damage during HIV infection. Clinical and pathological evidence of subcortical central nervous system (CNS) damage is observed commonly in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis. Whether other CNS regions are also affected has not been well studied. We report neocortical damage in patients with HIV encephalitis. Using quantitative techniques, we demonstrate statistically significant thinning of the neocortex, with a loss of large cortical neurons. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of neocortical neuropil reveal a loss of synaptic density and vacuolation of dendritic processes. Failure to demonstrate an association of these changes with the presence of HIV antigens suggests that neocortical damage may be an indirect effect of HIV infection of the CNS.",Virus_Diseases

"Recombinant virus vaccine-induced SIV-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Evidence indicates that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may be important in containing the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the infected host. Although the use of recombinant viruses has been proposed as an approach to elicit protective immunity against HIV, the ability of recombinant viral constructs to elicit CD8+ CTL responses in higher primates has never been demonstrated. A live recombinant virus, vaccinia-simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac), was used to determine whether such a genetically restricted, T lymphocyte-mediated antiviral response could be generated in a primate. Vaccinia-SIVmac vaccination elicited an SIVmac Gag-specific, CD8+ CTL response in rhesus monkeys. These CTLs recognized a peptide fragment that spans residues 171 to 195 of the Gag protein. The rhesus monkey major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene product restricting this CTL response was defined. Both the vaccinated and SIVmac-infected monkeys that shared this MHC class I gene product developed CTLs with the same Gag epitope specificity. These findings support the use of recombinant virus vaccines for the prevention of HIV infections in humans.",Virus_Diseases

"Simultaneous development of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and alopecia areata universalis. Alopecia areata universalis developed gradually over nine months in a 25-year-old woman. When her scalp hairs were totally lost and other body hair began to fall out, the symptoms of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, an organ-specific autoimmune disease, developed rapidly and progressed to diabetic coma. Alopecia did not regress after the metabolic state improved following insulin therapy. Biopsy of the scalp skin revealed significant reduction of the total number of hair bulbs and prominent lymphocyte infiltration into the remaining hair follicles. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and alopecia areata universalis are both thought to be related to the autoimmune mechanism and sometimes coexist.

"Tryptase, a mediator of human mast cells. Tryptase, a mediator secreted by human mast cells during immediate reactions, has demonstrated effects on several pathways in vitro. This enzyme can rapidly inactivate fibrinogen and, as a complex with heparin, may prevent coagulation that may otherwise occur when plasma enters tissues at sites of immediate reactions. Tryptase may also activate prostromelysin, which in turn activates latent collagenase. When canine pulmonary smooth muscle is incubated with canine tryptase, the contractile response to histamine is increased. Tryptase, quantifiable in complex biologic fluids by immunoassay, can serve as a specific indicator of mast cell involvement in certain clinical settings. For example, after bee sting--induced anaphylaxis, tryptase levels in the blood peak at approximately 1 hour, then decline with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Additionally, elevated tryptase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asymptomatic, atopic persons with asthma suggest ongoing mast cell activation, which may relate to adenosine hyperresponsiveness and a persistence of bronchial hyperreactivity. Tryptase levels in bronchial lavage fluid of atopic patients with asthma rise markedly after endobronchial allergen challenge but not after an exercise challenge, suggesting a lack of mast cell involvement in the latter condition.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Urticaria pigmentosa and preleukemia: evidence for reactive mast cell proliferation. A 64-year-old man had urticaria pigmentosa and myelodysplasia (refractory anemia with excess blast cells; partial trisomy 8 syndrome) without increased numbers of marrow mast cells. Clonal marrow assays in agar demonstrated normal to increased colony-forming units of granulocytes/macrophages. In long-term liquid cultures containing mast cell growth factor (interleukin 3), his marrow cells proliferated after 3 weeks to produce abnormal myeloid precursors similar to those in the corresponding marrow aspirate specimen. Cells with basophilic-staining granules were less abundant in comparison with normal marrow specimens cultured similarly. These results suggest that the mast cells in this patient are not of the same clone as the preleukemic marrow cells, although the possible marrow-cell origin of urticaria pigmentosa mast cells cannot be excluded. Previous reports suggest that urticaria pigmentosa without systemic mastocytosis occurs as a nonspecific abnormality in a variety of myeloid, lymphoid, and nonhematologic malignancies. Our data also support this hypothesis that urticaria pigmentosa is a reactive process rather than a manifestation of clonal proliferation of the primary malignancy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Contribution of antibody response to recombinant HIV-1 gene-encoded products nef, rev, tat, and protease in predicting development of AIDS in HIV-1-infected individuals. The relation between antibody-response profiles to Escherichia coli-produced HIV-1 nef, rev, tat, and protease proteins and the risk of developing AIDS was studied using stored serum samples taken sequentially from a cohort of 195 initially symptom-free men who were seropositive for antibodies to HIV-1 structural proteins and 72 men who seroconverted for such antibodies. The AIDS attack rates at 39 months follow-up were significantly higher in the men with negative versus positive antibody profiles to nef, tat, and protease, respectively. [Difference (D) between attack rates = 11.279, 5.884, and 8.322, respectively]. No significant difference was found between men with negative versus positive antibody profiles to rev. The above differences between AIDS attack rates were clearly lower than those reported from the same cohort for men who were serum HIV-1 antigen positive versus negative, and for men with low versus normal CD4+ lymphocyte counts, but with respect to nef antibody-response profiles, resembled the difference reported between anti-HIV-1 core antibody-negative versus antibody-positive men. In the subgroup of men without any of the markers previously found to be predictive of progression to AIDS in the cohort (persistent HIV-1 p24 antigenemia, low anti-HIV-1 anti-core antibody reactivity, and low CD4+ cell counts), antibody profiles to nef, rev, tat, and protease did not contribute to the prediction of outcome of infection. When used in combination with persistent HIV-1 p24 antigenemia and low CD4+ cell counts, negative antibody profiles to nef and protease, respectively, were equally sensitive and specific in predicting progression to AIDS, as was low anti-HIV-1 anti-core antibody reactivity.",Virus_Diseases

"Oral and pharyngeal herpes simplex virus infection after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: analysis of factors associated with infection. This study analyzed factors associated with acute oropharyngeal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in 627 patients who had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia, lymphoma, or aplastic anemia. HSV infection developed in 233 (37%) of the patients; all but two were seropositive for HSV before transplant. Sixty-two percent of the seropositive patients had at least one episode of HSV reactivation during the first 100 days after transplant. Other factors that placed patients at increased risk for HSV infection were a pretransplant diagnosis of leukemia, being in remission at the time of transplant, and/or having been conditioned for transplant with chemoradiotherapy. Recognition of factors that may predispose patients to HSV infection helps determine those transplant recipients who might benefit most from antiviral prophylaxis or other approaches to prevention of HSV reactivation.",Virus_Diseases
"The innermost cell layer of the outer root sheath is positive with Ki-67. The expression of a cell proliferation-associated human nuclear antigen was immunohistochemically studied in human anagen hair and hair follicles using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. The reaction of Ki-67 in mature anagen hair follicles was observed in the hair matrix cells and outer root sheath (ORS) cells. Nuclear staining was seen in a small number of matrix cells and in some ORS cells; this finding corresponded to the thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine labeling studies previously reported. In addition, there were two different patterns of cytoplasmic staining in the ORS: strong staining of the innermost cells (IMC) and weaker staining of the other ORS cells in the isthmus. Ki-67 reactivity of the IMC layer was observed at each stage of anagen and was regularly seen from the upper bulb to the isthmus. Ki-67 is a commercially available antibody that detects cycling cells.

"Cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics in children with external ventricular drains. Fifty-five children had 64 external ventricular drains (EVDs) placed predominantly (95%) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infections. In 9 children, a computer monitoring system measured the CSF output each second continuously for up to 24 hours. The monitoring was repeated daily for up to 9 days. The state of arousal of the patients was recorded simultaneously. In all children, daily EVD outputs were related to age, sex, weight, method of establishing the EVD, height of the drip chamber, time since insertion, and type of infecting organism. Computer monitoring revealed wide fluctuations in flow rate, with peak rates frequently greater than 20 ml/h and periods of flow arrest. These changes were usually associated with increased arousal, but also occurred with sleep. The mean EVD flow rate for all children was 6.3 ml/h. EVD output increased with age and weight. EVD output decreased with Gram-negative or multiple-organism infections and with elevation of the drip chamber. Resolution of the infection, sex of the patient, and method of establishing the EVD had no effect on output. These results predict that CSF production increases with brain growth in humans: that CSF production is depressed by Gram-negative and multiple-organism infections: that implanted CSF shunts with standard valves flow at equivalent rates to an EVD in the supine position; and that the CSF drainage requirements in this group are approximately equal to their EVD outputs.",Virus_Diseases
"Antibodies to HIV-1 nef(p27): prevalence, significance, and relationship to seroconversion. A sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunoassay for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nef gene product, p27, has been developed using recombinant Escherichia coli-derived protein from the LAV-1-Bru sequence. Of 92 HIV-1 infected hemophiliacs, 72 (78%) produced anti-nef antibodies in this assay; the early appearance of anti-nef prior to full seroconversion was a rare event in this population, occurring in only one subject (approximately 1%). Anti-nef antibodies were not detected in any of 500 sera from 98 repeatedly HIV seronegative subjects who had been exposed to sexually transmitted modes of HIV infection (45 subjects) or through blood products (53 subjects). There was no significant association of titer or anti-nef antibody with protection from disease in HIV infection (p = 0.1). Although the nef protein is relatively immunogenic in natural infection, this study cannot confirm the previously reported high prevalence of anti-nef antibodies prior to seroconversion, nor the finding of anti-nef antibodies in HIV seronegative but exposed subjects.",Virus_Diseases

"Human papillomavirus screening for women with atypical Papanicolaou smears. A study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and colposcopy in the management of women whose Papanicolaou smears demonstrated atypia less than dysplasia. Fifty patients whose initial Papanicolaou smears were interpreted as showing atypia less than dysplasia were evaluated for the presence of HPV 16 DNA in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells and for histologic findings on biopsy. Those 50 patients were compared to two groups of patients: one consisting of 124 patients with biopsy-documented cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and another of 112 patients with normal Papanicolaou smears. The presence of HPV 16 DNA was confirmed with Southern analysis in 46% of patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears, 46% with confirmed CIN and 11.6% with normal Papanicolaou smears. The 50 patients with atypical smears underwent colposcopically directed cervical biopsies, revealing the following results: 14 (28%) had normal histology, 29 (58%) had koilocytosis without dysplasia, and 7 (14%) had CIN. HPV 16 DNA was present in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells from a large percentage of patients from each category (50% of patients with normal histology, 41.2% with koilocytosis and 57% with CIN).

"Chronic ulcerations following topical therapy with 5-fluorouracil for vaginal human papillomavirus-associated lesions. Applied topically to the vagina, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream is an effective therapy for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated lesions of the vagina including condylomata acuminata and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Although the acute side effects of 5-FU therapy are well recognized, long-term sequelae of intravaginal 5-FU use have not been described in detail in the literature. To assess the incidence and clinical course of 5-FU-related vaginal mucosal alterations, we studied 220 patients who underwent 5-FU therapy for HPV-associated lesions of the vagina. Eighteen women (8.2%) had epithelial ulcers 6 months after completion of the 5-FU treatment. The incidence of ulcers was higher in women who used 5-FU for longer than 10 weeks compared with those who used it for 10 weeks or less (9.6 versus 5.7%; P = .05). All but one of the mucosal defects were in the vaginal fornices and/or the periphery of the ectocervix. The ulcers were mostly singular and measured 0.5-7 cm in greatest diameter. Fourteen patients (77.8%) had symptoms related to the ulcers including a serosanguineous or watery discharge (55.6%), postcoital spotting or bleeding (44.4%), irregular bleeding unrelated to intercourse (16.7%), and pain (5.6%). Spontaneous healing of the ulcers was protracted. Office methods of therapy including estrogen creams and cauterizing agents failed to accelerate healing as compared with untreated patients. Excision of the ulcer and primary closure of the wound was curative in all four cases in which it was used. We conclude that topical 5-FU therapy may lead to troublesome chronic mucosal ulcers that tend to persist despite conservative treatment attempts.",Virus_Diseases

"Human cervical epithelial cells that express HLA-DR associated with viral infection and activated mononuclear cell infiltrate. The association between the expression of HLA-DR antigens on cervical epithelium and the local immune state of activation in colposcopically obtained biopsy specimens from patients with histologically documented wart virus infection was investigated. In normal cervical epithelium no HLA-DR staining was detected. No or few IL-2R positive cells were found in the contiguous sections. HLA-DR was expressed by epithelial cells in six out of the 14 samples of wart virus infection. The pattern of fluorescence was focal, but strong and diffuse, to the whole epithelial layer. In the six samples with HLA-DR positive epithelium the numbers of IL-2R positive cells in the lamina propria were strongly increased, ranging between 75 and 90%. HLA-DR expression by cervical epithelium was observed in only two of 12 samples from patients with mixed epithelial non-virus related abnormalities. No increase in the numbers of IL-2R positive cells was observed in this group of patients. Additionally, no significant differences in terms of T lymphocyte infiltrate were found among the three groups. The results indicate that wart virus infection is associated with enhanced HLA-DR epithelial expression and they lend support to the concept that in the human cervix the epithelium actively participates in the local immune response.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Double-blind, right/left comparison of calcipotriol and betamethasone valerate in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris [published erratum appears in Lancet 1991 Apr 20;337(8747):988]  The therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of calcipotriol ointment and betamethasone valerate ointment in psoriasis were compared in a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, right/left trial. 345 inpatients and outpatients with psoriasis vulgaris of symmetrical distribution were treated twice daily for 6 weeks with calcipotriol ointment 50 micrograms/g and betamethasone ointment 0.1% randomly assigned to opposite sides of the body. The main outcome measures--the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), the investigators' assessments of erythema, thickness, and scaling, and the patients' own assessments of the overall response to treatment--were sought at weeks 2, 4, and 6. Both treatments significantly reduced the PASI scores and the investigator's assessment scores, but at each visit the PASI score was significantly (p less than 0.001) lower with calcipotriol than with betamethasone. At 6 weeks the mean PASI reduction was 68.8% with calcipotriol and 61.4% with betamethasone (95% confidence interval for difference 5.1-9.8, p less than 0.001). The scores for erythema, thickness, and scaling were significantly (p less than 0.001) lower with calcipotriol than with betamethasone at the end of treatment. The patients considered that 82.1% of calcipotriol-treated sides and 69.3% of betamethasone-treated sides had improved greatly or cleared up by the end of treatment (p less than 0.001). 57 adverse events were reported by 52 patients (15.1%). The most common adverse event, lesional/perilesional skin irritation, was slightly but not significantly (p = 0.12) more common with calcipotriol treatment. 15 (4.3%) patients were withdrawn from the study, 3 because of local adverse events. There were no changes in serum calcium during the study. Thus, calcipotriol ointment was superior to betamethasone valerate ointment in psoriasis vulgaris.

The panelists were challenged 2 weeks later; 2 panelists who had mild reactions were subsequently rechallenged 6 weeks later. Neither CMA nor road salt produced contact hypersensitivity in any panelists. Following the first application, moderate acute irritation was observed only at 1 skin site exposed to 30% road salt. Repeated exposure to CMA or road salt produced mild to moderate irritation. The highest incidence of moderate irritation was observed with 30% road salt.

"Endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis  Endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain has been the preferred treatment for palmar or axillary hyperhidrosis in this unit since 1980. A retrospective study was carried out of the first 112 patients with case material derived from a postal questionnaire, chart review and outpatient assessment. Eighty-five patients undergoing bilateral transthoracic electrocautery who replied to the questionnaire (76 per cent response rate) form the basis of this study. There were 65 females and 20 males with a mean age of 24.3 years (range 15-40 years). The hands alone were affected in 20 patients (24 per cent), the axillae alone in 17 (20 per cent) and both areas in 48 (56 per cent). Mean hospital stay was 3.1 days (range 1-7 days). Outcome was assessed by 92 per cent of patients immediately after operation as 'very much improved' or 'moderately improved', and this assessment persisted in 85 per cent after a mean follow-up of 43 months (range 3-95 months). Cosmetic results were rated as satisfactory by 95 per cent. Apart from pain after operation, morbidity was limited to transient Horner's syndrome in three patients, surgical emphysema in three, and pneumothorax requiring a chest drain in one. A repeat procedure was needed in one patient because of an inadequate first operation. Some compensatory hyperhidrosis occurred in 54 (64 per cent) patients. As a minimally invasive procedure, endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery should be considered the treatment of choice for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Parasites of the skin and hair. Because scratching is nature's treatment for ectoparasites, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any pruritic rash. Usually, the diagnosis is not difficult to make if the clinician suspects an ectoparasitic cause and is familiar with the symptoms and signs of these disorders. The diagnosis is confirmed using a few instruments and basic office supplies. The clinician must treat not only the individual patient but must also consider the source of the infection because others may require treatment. Family and community education about removal of the parasites from the patient's environment is one of the clinician's responsibilities.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Increased expression of type VI collagen genes in systemic sclerosis. The expression of type VI collagen genes in affected skin from patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) was examined by in situ hybridizations with a human alpha 2(VI) collagen sequence-specific complementary DNA. Five patients with diffuse, rapidly progressive SSc of recent onset (less than 12 months) were studied. The results showed increased expression of alpha 2(VI) collagen messenger RNA transcripts in the skin of scleroderma patients compared with that in the skin of normal subjects. These findings indicate that alterations in the expression of type VI collagen genes, similar to those previously described for types I and III collagen, are present in the affected skin of SSc patients. These alterations may result in excessive tissue accumulation of type VI collagen and may play a role in the progressive skin induration and sclerosis that are prominent features of SSc.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Inhibitory effect of zinc oxide on contact allergy due to colophony. Contact allergy to a wound dressing with an adhesive mass consisting of colophony, zinc oxide and rubber (Mezinc) was studied in 179 patients with a history of eczema. 12 patients were found to be allergic to colophony, whereas only 4 of these patients also showed a positive patch test reaction to the wound dressing. 14 patients with verified moderate contact allergy to colophony were patch tested with adhesive mass (10%), Portuguese colophony (10%), zinc oxide (10%), purified resin acids (10%), and Portuguese colophony (10%), in combination with zinc oxide. Only 3 patients reacted to the adhesive mass, whereas all patients showed a positive patch test reaction to Portuguese colophony. A combination of zinc oxide (10%) with Portuguese colophony (10%) provoked a positive patch test reaction in only 5 of these 14 patients. An allergic reaction to abietic acid (90-95% purity) was found in 7 patients and to neoabietic acid (99 + %) in 3 patients, whereas no reactions to dehydroabietic (99 + %), isopimaric (99 + %) or levopimaric acids (98 + %) were found.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The occurrence and significance of hand deformities in early rheumatoid arthritis. One hundred rheumatoid arthritis patients (38 men, 62 women), with mean age of 53 years and mean disease duration of 11.5 months, were followed. Standardized clinical, biochemical, and radiographic evaluation was performed regularly. After 2 years the prevalence of ulnar deviation, buttonhole deformity, and swan neck deformity was 13%, 16%, and 8%, respectively. Altogether, 31 patients had developed one or more deformities. There was no difference in age or gender distribution and no predominance of the dominant hand. Each patient with a deformity was matched according to age, sex, and disease duration with another early RA patient without deformity. The deformity group had more active disease, less grip strength, more disability, and markedly more severe radiographic changes. When studied retrospectively at a time point 3 months prior to the detection of deformity, synovitis of relevant joints was as common in the group who developed deformities as in the control group. This suggests that joint inflammation may contribute to the genesis of deformity but additional factors are needed. Hand deformities were found to be common in early RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Population-based estimates of zidovudine and aerosol pentamidine use in San Francisco: 1987-1989. From the San Francisco Men's Health Study (SFMHS) and the San Francisco General Hospital Cohort we derived partially population-based estimates of zidovudine (ZDV) use in San Francisco from 1987 to 1989. Data from the SFMHS alone were used to make estimates of aerosol pentamidine (AP) use in 1989. From 1987 to 1989, zidovudine use increased from 36 to 68% in participants with AIDS. In participants with symptomatic HIV infection without AIDS and in those with less than 200 CD4 cells, ZDV use increased initially but then leveled off (from 6 to 25% and 24 to 55%, respectively). Zidovudine use with more than 500 CD4 cells increased from 0.5 to 4%. In 1989 AP use with less than 200 CD4 cells was 42% and with AIDS was 44%. Whereas 50% of participants with AIDS and less than 200 CD4 were using both ZDV and AP, only 14% of those without AIDS but with less than 200 CD4 cells were using both. Surprisingly few members of these cohorts are using therapies proven effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Evidence of heterogeneous mechanisms in lipoprotein lipid alterations in hyperandrogenic women. Fifty-one hyperandrogenic women had their lipoprotein lipid profiles determined. Free and albumin-bound testosterone was associated with triglycerides and with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels, percent ideal body weight, and waist/hip ratio. To gain insight into mechanisms of these lipid alterations, the women were subgrouped according to apparent source of androgen excess. Whereas all groups had low levels of high-density lipoprotein-2 cholesterol and high triglyceride concentrations, only in those with high luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratios was free and albumin-bound testosterone associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels. Relationships between percent ideal body weight and waist/hip ratios, free and albumin-bound testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, fasting insulin and 2-hour insulin levels and blood pressure are not significant in all subgroups, suggesting differing endocrinological influences and differing mechanisms for lipoprotein lipid alterations.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A long-term study of hepatitis C virus replication in non-A, non-B hepatitis. BACKGROUND. Although antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are known to be associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis, little is known about the pattern of HCV replication, its relation to antibody levels, and the clinical course of non-A, non-B hepatitis. METHODS. We measured HCV RNA in serial serum samples from five patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis who were followed for 10 to 14 years after transfusion. We also studied four chimpanzees that were experimentally infected with serum from four of these patients. Serum HCV RNA was detected by a ""nested"" polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay that used two sets of primers derived from the third (NS3) and fourth (NS4) non-structural gene regions of the HCV genome. RESULTS. HCV sequences were detected by PCR in only two of the five patients and two of the four chimpanzees with the set of primers corresponding to the NS3 region, but in all five patients (and in all four chimpanzees) with the primers from the NS4 region. Serum HCV RNA was first detected within three weeks of transfusion in all five patients and within one week in three patients. The viremia lasted less than 4 months in the patient (and two chimpanzees) with acute, self-limited hepatitis, whereas it persisted for 10 to 14 years in the four patients (and for 1 and 3 years in two chimpanzees) with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Antibodies to HCV were first detected at week 12 to 14; they disappeared after nine years in the patient with self-limited disease and became borderline after five years in one of the patients with chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS. During the early phase of primary HCV infection, there is a period of several months of sero-negativity during which HCV RNA is the only diagnostic marker of infection. The disappearance of HCV RNA from serum appears to correlate with the resolution of non-A, non-B hepatitis, whereas viremia persists in patients whose disease progresses to chronic hepatitis. In contrast, antibody levels do not necessarily remain elevated in patients with chronic disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Serum keratan sulfate. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons in inflammatory versus noninflammatory arthritides. The concentration of keratan sulfate (KS) epitope was measured in the serum of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with that in the serum of patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) and of controls who had no joint disease. By Student's tau-test, the mean serum KS concentrations in OA and RA patients measured with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) 5-D-4 and 2-D-3 were significantly increased over those in the PFS and normal groups; similar findings were observed using a nonparametric test, except that levels in RA patients showed no difference from those in PFS patients and normal subjects. There was no significant correlation between joint scores or disease duration and KS levels in OA or RA patients. Gel filtration of sera revealed mainly large, polydisperse KS-bearing fragments which eluted in a broad profile. KS purified from sera by immunoaffinity chromatography consisted mainly of high-density proteoglycans. Electrophoresis of pooled high-density KS fractions in polyacrylamide-agarose gels followed by Western blotting with MAb 5-D-4 showed diffuse bands with relative mobilities corresponding to large proteoglycans. These findings are consistent with attachment of KS to protein core fragments of various sizes; KS in patient sera is comparable in size with that in normal sera. Elevations of serum KS levels occur in the presence of cartilage degradation, but do not quantitatively define the extent or duration of articular involvement.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Newly identified U4/U6 snRNP-binding proteins by serum autoantibodies from a patient with systemic sclerosis. We found serum autoantibodies directed against the proteins binding exclusively to U4/U6 of Sm small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) in serum from a patient (MaS) with systemic sclerosis. Their specificity, called anti-MaS, is distinct from that of known antibodies against U snRNP. The U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA from a 32P-labeled HeLa cell extract and five proteins with Mr 150,000, 120,000, 80,000, 36,000, and 34,000, in addition to Sm core proteins (B, B', D, E, F, and G) from an [35S] methionine-labeled extract, were immunoprecipitated by anti-MaS in isotonic solution. However, the Sm core proteins and U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA were separated from the protein-A-Sepharose facilitated MaS immunoprecipitate by incubation in a solution containing 500 mM NaCl. In immunoblots, anti-MaS antibodies reacted with one protein of Mr 150,000 from a HeLa cell nuclear extract that was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The monospecific immunoaffinity purified antibody eluted from the immunoblot band immunoprecipitated U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA and reblotted the protein with Mr 150,000. These data indicate that anti-MaS antibodies recognize at least one antigenic protein that binds exclusively to the U4/U6 snRNP.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

An open-label, phase IV, multicenter survey of obstetrician-gynecologists was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a low-dose monophasic oral contraceptive, ethynodiol diacetate, 1 mg, with ethinyl estradiol, 35 micrograms. Surveys from 983 community-based physicians reported on 6,382 women. Most patients did not experience ""clinically noticeable complexion changes"" (5,695/6,382, or 89.2%). Of the 687 patients with complexion changes, nearly three-fourths reported an improvement (501/687, or 72.9%). A follow-up questionnaire was sent to 127 respondents (18.6%) who reported worsening of the complexion; 70% of the questionnaires were returned. Most complexion worsening was of slight degree (63%), reported by the patient and not the physician (84% vs. 16%), and experienced during the first two to three months (84%).

"A single base insertion in the putative transmembrane domain of the tyrosinase gene as a cause for tyrosinase-negative oculocutaneous albinism. We have determined a molecular defect to be the likely basis for inactivity of the tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) from a patient with tyrosinase-negative oculocutaneous albinism. A single base (thymine) was inserted in exon 5 of the tyrosinase gene following codon 471 in the putative transmembrane coding region. This insertion caused a shift in the reading frame of 19 amino acids at the 3' end and introduced a premature termination signal that would be expected to truncate the protein by 21 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. The albino tyrosinase was not recognized by antibodies directed to the carboxyl terminus of tyrosinase. Furthermore, as shown by gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated protein, the tyrosinase was approximately 3 kDa smaller than normal.

"The temporomandibular joint in rheumatoid arthritis. Correlations between clinical and computed tomography features. Clinical and computed tomography (CT) examination of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) was performed in 26 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 26 control subjects. Each examination was scored. In the group with RA 61.2% had physical signs in the stomatognathic system compared to 42.3% in a control group (NS); 88.4% of the group with RA had erosive or cystic lesions of the TMJ compared to 57.6% of control subjects (p less than 0.05). The clinical dysfunction score did not correlate with the CT TMJ score in RA. It correlated with the number of slow acting antirheumatic drugs used, the rheumatoid factor titer and radiographic scores of the hands and cervical spine. In agreement with others, we believe that the only specific CT lesions of RA are erosions and cysts of the mandibular condyle, that there is no correlation between clinical and CT findings of TMJ in RA, and that the intensity of destructive lesions of TMJ on CT in RA is well correlated with the severity of the disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"In situ human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in South African and British patients: evidence for putative HPV integration in vivo. In South Africa asymptomatic wart virus infection diagnosed by morphological criteria occurs in 16-20% of all ethnic groups; the incidence in black women is 66%. To identify human papillomavirus (HPV) types the prevalence of HPV in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in South African women (n = 72) with age matched British women (n = 73) was compared by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) using digoxigenin labelled probes for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 on archival biopsy specimens. A higher proportion of British biopsy specimens (68%) contained HPV than those from South Africa (50%) in CIN 2 and 3; this difference was due to HPV 16. Thirty six per cent of the positive biopsy specimens from South African women also contained HPV 33/35 compared with 16% in the United Kingdom. There was no difference in HPV detection with age in either group. These data indicate that HPV types vary geographically, with ""minor"" HPV types being more common in South Africa. Three qualitatively distinct NISH signals were observed; a diffuse (type 1) signal in superficial cells, mainly koilocytes; a punctate signal (type 2) in basal/""undifferentiated"" cells in CIN 3; and combined type 1 and 2 signals in CIN with wart virus infection (type 3).

"Impaired lipopolysaccharide-inducible tumor necrosis factor production in vitro by peripheral blood monocytes of patients with viral hepatitis. We investigated lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor production in vitro by peripheral blood monocytes from patients with various liver diseases. Tumor necrosis factor production was found to be significantly reduced in patients with chronic hepatitis B (n = 17; 135 +/- 30 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml; mean +/- S.E.M.) and patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (n = 15; 212 +/- 22 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) compared with healthy control individuals (n = 47; 411 +/- 40 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml; p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.01, respectively). This reduced tumor necrosis factor production was not only seen with an optimal stimulating concentration of lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml) but also with suboptimal concentrations (0.1 ng/ml). In contrast to patients with chronic viral hepatitis, monocytes from patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis (n = 26; 444 +/- 49 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 7; 412 +/- 81 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) and alcohol-induced fatty liver changes (n = 5; 401 +/- 62 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) produced normal amounts of tumor necrosis factor when stimulated with an optimal concentration of lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide (0.1 ng lipopolysaccharide/ml)-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes of patients with chronic hepatitis B (n = 15; 102 +/- 32 pg/ml) or non-A, non-B hepatitis (n = 13; 97+/- 16 pg/ml) could not be induced to produce more tumor necrosis factor either when prestimulated with gamma-interferon (170 +/- 45 pg/ml and 149 +/- 32 pg/ml, respectively), a lymphokine known to activate monocytes, or with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin to reduce the suppressive effect of prostaglandin E2 (148 +/- 40 pg/ml and 153 +/- 45 pg/ml, respectively.",Virus_Diseases
"The prevalence and nature of podiatric problems in elderly diabetic patients. To determine if diabetes in the elderly is associated with increased prevalence of podiatric problems, a random sample of diabetic patients (n = 74) was compared to a group of elderly non-diabetic patients (n = 79). The two groups were comparable in age (range 70-90 years), smoking habits, and consumption of alcohol. The mean duration of diabetes was 14.5 +/- 11.7 years (+/- SD), and mean serum fructosamine level was 3.3 +/- 0.66 mmol/L. The number of medical diagnoses and medications used was significantly higher in the diabetic group. Diabetic patients had modestly higher prevalence of neuropathy, vascular disease, kidney disease, and eye complications. The most common podiatric problem in both groups was elongated toenails. The prevalence of podiatric problems such as cellulitis, amputation, tinea pedia, onychomycosis, calluses, bunions, and hammer toe deformity were not increased in diabetic patients. Active foot ulcers were more common in diabetic patients (13/74 vs 5/79, P less than 0.05).

"Androgens and oligomenorrhea in hirsute women. A recent study demonstrated that hirsute women with irregular menses had higher levels of serum androgens that hirsute women with regular menses. To investigate this finding, we measured total testosterone, biologically active testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in 51 hirsute women with regular menses and compared the levels found to those found in 28 hirsute women with oligomenorrhea. There was no significant difference in the degree of facial hirsutism between the two groups. Oligomenorrheic women had significantly higher levels of free testosterone (p less than 0.02) and biologically active testosterone (p less than 0.05). The other androgens did not differ significantly between the two groups. The free fractions of testosterone are the metabolically active forms of the hormone and their levels are a function of the rates of production and clearance of testosterone that are elevated in states of hyperandrogenism. This study confirms that hirsute women with oligomenorrhea have higher levels of free and biologically active testosterone than those with regular menses.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Dermatitis herpetiformis bodies. Ultrastructural study on the skin of patients using direct preembedding immunogold labeling. Skin samples from three adult patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and granular IgA deposits in the papillary tips were studied using ultrastructural immunogold technique. IgA positive, so-called DH bodies were identified as amorphous clumps--most probably immunocomplex aggregates--scattered throughout the upper papillary dermis. Dermatitis herpetiformis bodies were seen underneath the basement membrane, sometimes along microfibrillar bundles, as well as adjacent to the papillary collagen fibers and within the surface (microfibrillar) region of elastic tissue. Some DH bodies, however, were not related to any fibrillar components. The collagen and elastic fibers, microfibrillar bundles, anchoring fibrils, and elastic microfibrils themselves were unlabeled. Dermatitis herpetiformis bodies were not found in normal human skin. The results of our ultrastructural study indicate that DH bodies either are bound to a nonfibrillar component of dermal connective tissue or represent deposits of immune complexes trapped in DH skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Immunization of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus monkeys with soluble human CD4 elicits an antiviral response. Since the CD4 molecule is a high-affinity cell-surface receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it has been suggested that a soluble truncated form of CD4 may compete with cell-surface CD4 for HIV binding and thus be of use in the therapy of AIDS. We have utilized the simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac)-infected rhesus monkeys to explore another possible therapeutic application of CD4 in AIDS--the use of recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4) as an immunogen. SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys immunized with human rsCD4 developed not only an anti-human CD4 but also an anti-rhesus monkey CD4 antibody response. Coincident with the generation of this antibody response, SIVmac could not be isolated easily from peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow macrophages of these animals. Furthermore, the decreased number of both granulocyte/macrophage and erythrocyte colonies grown from the bone marrow of these immunized monkeys rose to normal levels. These findings suggest that a modified human CD4 molecule serving as an immunogen might elicit an antibody response in man that could induce a beneficial therapeutic response in HIV-infected individuals.",Virus_Diseases

DESIGN--Retrospective study of both general practice and hospital records. SETTING--12 Group practices in south Bedfordshire and the radiology and paediatric outpatient departments of a district general hospital. SUBJECTS--23 Children with renal scars (six boys, 17 girls) from the 12 group practices, identified from outpatient, radiology, and general practice records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of children in whom a diagnosis of urinary tract infection had been made without prior examination of a mid-stream specimen of urine; number of children who had had a confirmed urinary tract infection that had not been investigated further; number who had experienced delays in investigation or referral; and number who had received inadequate follow up. RESULTS--In all, 11 of the children had received suboptimal medical care, but the management of the other 12 could not have been better. The most common error was failure to investigate possible urinary tract infections, but follow up of confirmed infections was also inadequate. These problems occurred in hospital as well as in general practice.

"Complement C4-derived monocyte-directed chemotaxis-inhibitory factor. A molecular mechanism to cause polymorphonuclear leukocyte-predominant infiltration in rheumatoid arthritis synovial cavities. To reveal the mechanism of the lesser infiltration of monocytes in synovial cavities with rheumatoid arthritis despite the presence of chronic inflammation, the synovial fluid from 15 rheumatoid arthritis patients was analyzed with respect to leukocyte chemotaxis. The synovial fluid possessed strong chemotactic activity to polymorphonuclear leukocytes but rather suppressed one to monocytes. The synovial fluid contained two different inhibitory activities in monocyte chemotaxis. One, which also suppressed polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, was identified as alpha 1 protease inhibitor. The other, with molecular weight of 8 kd, possessed the specificity to monocytes and shared the antigenicity with complement C4 but not with C3 or C5. A similar inhibitor was generated in normal human plasma when the classical pathway of the complement system was initiated with aggregated human IgG, while it was not when alternative pathway was initiated with zymosan. The small size factor in the synovial fluid, apparently derived from C4, seemed to be a cyto-directed factor that might block an early part of signal transduction system of monocytes in the chemotaxis. After removal of the small-size inhibitor, the synovial fluid exhibited chemotactic ability to monocytes. Therefore the apparent C4-derived factor might play a key role in the polymorphonuclear leukocyte-predominant infiltration in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Surrogate markers for survival in patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex treated with zidovudine  OBJECTIVE--To determine whether early effects of zidovudine treatment on CD4+ lymphocyte count and concentrations of beta 2 microglobulin, neopterin, or HIV p24 antigen or antibody are correlated with survival in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. DESIGN--Retrospective study of changes in laboratory markers and survival. SETTING--Multicentre trial at university hospital clinics. SUBJECTS--90 Patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. INTERVENTION--Patients started zidovudine 200 mg orally every four hours. Fifty six of the patients died a median 17 months after starting zidovudine; the remaining 34 patients were followed up for a median 25.5 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in CD4+ lymphocyte count and serum concentrations of p24 antigen and antibody, beta 2 microglobulin, and neopterin; survival of the patient. RESULTS--The pretreatment characteristics that independently predicted poor survival were determined using a multivariate proportional hazards model: a diagnosis of AIDS (v AIDS related complex), age over 45 years, and the logarithm of serum neopterin concentration. When these baseline characteristics were controlled for the logarithm of CD4+ lymphocyte count at weeks 8-12 of treatment (p = 0.007) and an increase in serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration at weeks 8-12 (p = 0.05) also independently correlated with survival. In the 38 patients with a better pretreatment prognosis, 24 month survival estimated by the product-limit method was 88% for those with a good response on both surrogate markers during early treatment compared with only 50% for those with a poor response on either marker. In the 38 with a worse pretreatment prognosis, 24 month survival was estimated to be 49% for those with a good response on both surrogate markers compared with only 18% for those with a poor response on either. CONCLUSION--These data suggest that CD4+ lymphocyte count at 8-12 weeks and, perhaps, change in serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration could be surrogate end points for clinical outcome in trials of antiretroviral drugs for patients with HIV disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Occupational contact dermatitis due to acrylonitrile. Within DSM Chemicals BV, a producer of acrylonitrile, skin complaints are frequent. The majority of these are of an irritant nature, while a smaller portion is based on acquired allergies. Allergological examination revealed 5 employees with an allergy to acrylonitrile. 1 of these subjects also developed paraesthesiae in the skin sites affected, a finding not previously described for acrylonitrile. In the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT), acrylonitrile showed strong allergenic potential. For prevention and treatment of contact allergologic disorders, close cooperation between occupational health officer, dermatologist and toxicologist in chemical companies is recommended.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Yield from total skin examination and effectiveness of skin cancer awareness program. Findings in 874 new dermatology patients. The authors reviewed 874 dermatology charts to assess the acceptance rate of total skin examination (TSE), incidental skin findings, and patient compliance regarding treatment recommendations. Of the 874 new dermatology patients studied, 707 (80.9%) agreed to TSE. Important incidental findings were found in 151 (21.4%). These included: (1) biopsy specimen-confirmed malignant tumors (malignant melanoma, lentigo maligna, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) in 24 of the 707 patients (3.4%), (2) biopsy specimen-confirmed premalignant tumors (actinic keratosis with dysplasia, Bowenoid actinic keratosis, Bowenoid papulosis, and lentigo with dysplasia, in five (0.7%), (3) clinically diagnosed premalignant actinic keratosis in 64 (9.1%), (4) biopsy specimen-confirmed dysplastic nevi in 17 (2.4%), and (5) congenital nevi in 41 (5.8%). Only 4.2% of the patients returned for a yearly TSE, and only 6.0% were found to follow all recommendations for monthly self examination, yearly professional examination, and sun protection. It is concluded that TSE for all new patients, and on a yearly basis for all return patients, is valuable in the detection of many skin conditions and allows skin cancer screening to be done, since patients for the most part do not follow recommendations for at-home screening.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Facial nerve and medially invasive petrous bone cholesteatomas. Eight patients with extensive petrous bone cholesteatomas that invaded the labyrinth and fallopian canal are presented. The eight cases are added to a tabulation of prior literature reports to elucidate concepts of routes of extension of medially invasive temporal bone cholesteatoma. Medially invasive petrous bone cholesteatoma develops insidiously, often without symptoms other than facial palsy and/or unilateral deafness. Typically, a history of chronic ear disease can be obtained. While hearing is unlikely to be preserved in this group of patients, facial nerve function can usually be preserved, and a facial nerve graft was not necessary in our series. Acute facial nerve palsy or facial nerve paresis progressing to palsy in patients with a history of chronic ear disease should be studied radiographically for petrous bone cholesteatoma, even if there is no physical evidence of cholesteatoma.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Rheumatic manifestations in myelodysplastic syndromes. The myelodysplastic syndromes are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with possible transformation to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. We describe a patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts with unusual rheumatic manifestations of vasculitis, migratory synovitis, arthralgias, and myalgias. A retrospective review over a 6-month period of 162 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes found 16 patients (10%) with several rheumatic manifestations. We divided these manifestations into 4 different categories: cutaneous vasculitis, ""lupus-like syndrome,"" neuropathy, and patients with both a rheumatic disease and a myelodysplastic syndrome. There were 7 with cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis and other individual cases of urticarial vasculitis and panniculitis; 3 with lupus-like manifestations with histological evidence of an inflammatory process; 3 with neuropathic manifestations including peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis with foot drop, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; and 3 patients in which their myelodysplastic syndrome was diagnosed after their rheumatic disease was known, including rheumatoid arthritis. Sjogren's syndrome and mixed connective tissue disease. The class with refractory anemia with excess blasts had 9 patients with rheumatic manifestations but also had the largest number of patients in the study (46/162 or 29%). Three of the 16 patients died, all from the refractory anemia with excess blasts class, reflecting the known mortality in this group of patients.

"Nerves in inflammatory synovium: immunohistochemical observations on the adjuvant arthritis rat model. Previous evidence has been presented that neurogenic input may influence adjuvant induced arthritis (AA) in rats. We now present evidence of alterations in synovial nerves in AA. Nerves were studied in well perfused and fixed rats, using immunohistochemistry with the sensitive avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) method and heterologous antisera to cytoskeletal protein gene product 9.5 (PGP) and the neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). The innervation of synovium was compared in normal rats and rats with AA. Observations concordant with what has been reported for neuropeptide nerves in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are presented. It has been suggested that neural peptide substances are reduced in nerves of synovium from patients with RA. In the AA rat a specific reduction of lining zone and sublining nerves in the synovium was noted. The AA rat model is very suitable for studying the involvement of synovial nerves in arthritis, permitting optimal preservation of immunoreactive neural epitopes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Comparing the yield of the standard Papanicolaou and endocervical brush smears. To compare the endocervical cell yield of the standard Papanicolaou smear and endocervical brush (Cytobrush) smear, cervical cytology smears using both techniques were obtained separately from each of 491 women between Aug 1, 1987, and Jan 31, 1990. The smear provided endocervical cells from 97% of the patients, while the Papanicolaou smear provided them from 64%. The brush was unsatisfactory (no endocervical cells) in 3% of the patients. In nine patients (2%) no endocervical cells were found on either specimen. In six patients (1%) the brush smear was unsatisfactory, while endocervical cells were found on the Papanicolaou smear. The study design precluded an adequate assessment of the sensitivity for detecting abnormal cells with the addition of the brush. The addition of an endocervical brush smear to the routine Papanicolaou smear appears to provide better sampling of the endocervical canal than does the standard Papanicolaou smear alone, using a cotton-tipped applicator.",Virus_Diseases
"A controlled trial comparing foscarnet with vidarabine for acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous herpes simplex in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The AIDS Clinical Trials Group. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Most strains of herpes simplex virus that are resistant to acyclovir are susceptible in vitro to both foscarnet and vidarabine. We conducted a randomized trial to compare foscarnet with vidarabine in 14 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and mucocutaneous herpetic lesions that had been unresponsive to intravenous therapy with acyclovir for a minimum of 10 days. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either foscarnet (40 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously every 8 hours) or vidarabine (15 mg per kilogram per day intravenously) for 10 to 42 days. In the isolates of herpes simplex virus we documented in vitro resistance to acyclovir and susceptibility to foscarnet and vidarabine. RESULTS. The lesions in all eight patients assigned to foscarnet healed completely after 10 to 24 days of therapy. In contrast, vidarabine was discontinued because of failure in all six patients assigned to receive it. The time to complete healing (P = 0.01), time to 50 percent reductions in the size of the lesions (P = 0.01) and the pain score (P = 0.004), and time to the end of viral shedding (P = 0.006) were all significantly shorter in the patients assigned to foscarnet. Three patients had new neurologic abnormalities while receiving vidarabine. No patient discontinued foscarnet because of toxicity. Although initial recurrences of herpes simplex infection after the index lesion had healed tended to be susceptible to acyclovir, acyclovir-resistant infection eventually recurred in every healed patient, a median of 42.5 days (range, 14 to 191) after foscarnet was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS. For the treatment of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex infection in patients with AIDS, foscarnet has superior efficacy and less frequent serious toxicity than vidarabine. Once the treatment is stopped, however; there is a high frequency of relapse.",Virus_Diseases
"Pathogenetic significance of reactive oxygen species in diffuse fibrosing alveolitis. Excessive release of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) from lung inflammatory cells has been claimed to be of major pathogenetic significance in diffuse fibrosing alveolitis. In the present study, the content of oxidized methionine residues [Met(O)] as a percentage of total methionine (Met) in BAL-derived proteins was used to assess the biologic effect of ROM. In addition, procollagen-III-peptide was measured in BAL fluid as a marker of fibroblast activation. We investigated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from seven control patients without evidence of interstitial lung disease and from 42 patients with fibrosing alveolitis caused by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), n = 20, or by collagen vascular disease (CVD), n = 22. Met(O) was elevated in the patients with IPF or CVD compared with that in the control subjects (8.86 +/- 1.26 and 8.13 +/- 1.44% versus 3.36 +/- 0.49%, p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively; mean +/- SEM). A positive correlation was found between percentage of neutrophils in BAL and Met(O) in both groups separately and combined (IPF, r = 0.84; p less than 0.001; CVD, r = 0.44; p less than 0.05; IPF and CVD, r = 0.60; p less than 0.001), whereas an inverse relationship existed between Met(O) and the percentage of alveolar macrophages in BAL (IPF, r = -0.59; p less than 0.01; CVD, r = -0.24; NS; IPF and CVD, r = -0.41; p less than 0.05).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Arterial desaturation in HIV positive patients undergoing sputum induction. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was monitored continuously during and immediately after sputum induction in 41 HIV positive patients with respiratory symptoms and in 20 symptomless medical and nursing staff, who acted as control subjects. Arterial oxygen desaturation (defined as SaO2 less than or equal to 92%) occurred during sputum induction and persisted for up to 20 minutes after the end of the procedure in 11 of the 20 patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and in nine of the 21 patients with other respiratory diagnoses. None of the control subjects showed oxygen desaturation. Neither the severity of chest radiographic abnormalities, the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (both measured before sputum induction), nor baseline SaO2 prospectively identified the patients who developed oxygen desaturation. Two patients, one with pneumocystis pneumonia, developed dyspnoea and had a fall in arterial oxygen saturation to 84% within 10 minutes of starting sputum induction. The procedure was abandoned in both patients and in two further patients, who developed severe nausea and reaching but no oxygen desaturation. Sputum induction in HIV positive patients with respiratory symptoms may induce a fall in SaO2 that persists after this procedure. This may be important if other procedures are performed soon after sputum induction.",Virus_Diseases

"Chaos, balance, and development: thoughts on selected childhood epilepsy syndromes. Age-specific epilepsy syndromes raise important questions about developmental susceptibility to seizures and epileptogenesis and about the effect of seizures on function. The diagnosis and treatment of these syndromes has been enhanced by the use of modern science and technology. Epidemiologic studies have changed our approach to febrile convulsions. This developmental seizure disorder is benign and self-limited. We have been forced to think carefully about threshold, therapy, and whether other seizures in childhood may be equally benign. This framework of developmental specificity can also be applied to West syndrome, especially with respect to neurophysiology, neurochemistry, neuroimaging, and epidemiology--the types of seizures, clustering, variations associated with sleep, PET scans, and therapy. Rasmussen's syndrome and other unilateral developmental epilepsies are progressive but remain confined to a single hemisphere. However, they usually are devastating to global neurologic function. They are models for examining the impact of epilepsy in one pathologic hemisphere on the function of the entire brain. Current therapy for this condition is hemispherectomy. Recovery of function after this major surgery is striking and provides clues to brain organization. The analysis of these three syndromes provides windows on the dynamic, changing central nervous system of the child and may lead to better understanding and therapy for other seizure disorders.",Virus_Diseases
"Expression of perforin in infiltrating cells in murine hearts with acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3. BACKGROUND. Cell-mediated autoimmunity has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using a murine model of acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3, we analyzed the phenotypes and morphology of the infiltrating cells in the hearts by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We also examined the expression of a cytolytic factor, perforin, in the infiltrating cells by immunoperoxidase and in situ hybridization. We found that the dominant population of the infiltrating cells were asialo GM1 positive, were negative for T-cell markers, and had electron-dense cytoplasmic granules, which is consistent with a morphology of large granular lymphocytes. Perforin was found in the cytoplasmic granules of the infiltrating cells expressing perforin messenger RNA. These findings provide for the first time the direct evidence that the first wave of cell infiltration in hearts mainly consists of killer cells and strongly suggests that perforin plays, in part, an important role in myocardial cell damage involved in acute viral myocarditis. T-helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes made up the second wave of cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS. As we previously reported, the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen on cardiac myocytes induced by the infiltrating cells, such as killer cells, may facilitate the interaction between cardiac myocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and may lead to further myocardial cell damage in a later phase.",Virus_Diseases
"Responses of glucose and glucoregulatory hormones to exercise in thyrotoxic and myxoedematous patients before and after 3 months of treatment. 1. The effect of moderate endurance exercise on blood glucose concentration and on glucoregulatory hormones was studied in nine thyrotoxic and five myxoedematous humans before and 3 months after anti-thyroid and substitution therapy, respectively. 2. At rest, the fasting concentrations of insulin and pro-insulin correlated positively with the prevailing total tri-iodothyronine concentration, whereas the concentrations of noradrenaline and cortisol correlated inversely with the tri-iodothyronine concentration. 3. During exercise the plasma insulin, pro-insulin and C-peptide concentrations decreased. The plasma glucagon concentration increased slightly in thyrotoxic patients before and after treatment and was largely unchanged in myxoedematous patients in either state. 4. The plasma noradrenaline concentration increased before and after treatment in both groups, with concentrations two times higher in the myxoedematous than in the thyrotoxic patients. Treatment for 3 months did not change this pattern. The plasma adrenaline concentration increased in both groups, but in the untreated thyrotoxic patients the increase was two to three times greater than that after treatment or that in the myxoedematous group. 5. The blood glucose concentration decreased in eight of nine untreated thyrotoxic patients, but was largely unchanged after treatment or in the myxoedematous patients. A strong negative correlation was found between the decline in blood glucose concentration and the increase in plasma adrenaline concentration in the thyrotoxic group. 6. Thus, during exercise untreated thyrotoxic patients are prone to hypoglycaemia, show an inadequate glucagon response, and exhibit a large counter-regulatory increase in plasma adrenaline concentration.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Differential stimulation by oxygen-free-radical-altered immunoglobulin G of the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. 1. The effect of free-radical-altered IgG (monomer and polymer u.v.-irradiated IgG), compared with that of native and heat-aggregated IgG, on the production rate of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by granulocytes (polymorphonuclear leucocytes) from normal blood and granulocytes obtained from the blood and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis was studied. 2. Similar rates of superoxide production by granulocytes from normal blood at rest and in the presence of any form of IgG were found. In contrast, the rate of hydrogen peroxide production could be stimulated in a dose-dependent fashion by monomer or polymer u.v.-irradiated IgG. 3. The stimulatory effect of free-radical-altered IgG on the rate of hydrogen peroxide production did not occur in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose, which deprives the NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase of its substrate NADPH by inhibition of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. This points to a stimulatory effect on the direct divalent reduction of oxygen without intermediate superoxide production by this enzyme complex. 4. Granulocytes obtained from the blood and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis reacted differently to polymer u.v.-irradiated IgG. In the presence of this stimulus the rate of release of both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide was increased. Furthermore, these granulocytes synthesized superoxide and hydrogen peroxide at a higher rate than did granulocytes from normal blood in the presence of serum-treated zymosan but not in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate. 5. Taken together, these results indicate that the rate of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by the granulocyte NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase depends on the pathological condition of the donor and the type of stimulus used.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Diagnostic accuracy of thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial thallium-201 (Tl-201) imaging performed in conjunction with exercise stress has enhanced the accuracy of detecting coronary artery disease among patients with chest pain. Sensitivity and specificity of qualitative visual Tl-201 scintigraphy for detection of coronary artery disease average 84% and 87%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of planar Tl-201 scintigrams has yielded sensitivity and specificity in the 90% range. Single photon emission computed tomographic imaging is associated with even higher sensitivity but with specificity in the 82-85% range. Perfusion defects representing ischemia can now be distinguished from scar by demonstration of delayed Tl-201 redistribution or enhanced uptake after reinjection of a second dose of Tl-201. Stenoses of the left circumflex coronary artery are less easily detected than lesions of the right and left anterior descending coronary arteries. False-positive Tl-201 perfusion defects may occur as a result of attenuation artifacts, most often caused by overlying breast tissue or by a high left hemidiaphragm. Patient motion during acquisition of single photon emission computed tomographic images results in artifactual defects on reconstruction. Abnormal Tl-201 uptake has been noted in patients with 1) left bundle branch block and normal coronary arteries, 2) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 3) progressive systemic sclerosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The progression of erosion and joint space narrowing scores in rheumatoid arthritis during the first twenty-five years of disease. Erosions and cartilage destruction are nearly universal features in peripheral joints that have been chronically affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Scoring methods to measure the extent of these abnormalities in hands and wrists have been developed and have been thoroughly tested in several studies to establish their reproducibility. In this study, we utilized one of these scoring methods to examine the progression of radiologic damage as related to duration of disease. Two hundred ninety-two patients from 3 different participating centers in the Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System were included. Six hundred fifty films of the hands and wrists, obtained from 210 patients, were scored for erosions and joint space narrowing. The average annual rate of progression of the total radiologic score, which sums erosion and joint space abnormalities and has a maximum possible score of 314, was approximately 4 units per year over the first 25 years after onset; this progression was more rapid in the earlier years of disease and slightly slower in the later years.

We studied the analgesic efficacy of an intravenous infusion of lidocaine and morphine in 19 adults with well-established postherpetic neuralgia in a three-session, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Compared with saline placebo, both lidocaine and morphine reduced pain intensity. Reductions in pain did not correlate with side effects produced by the infusions. For morphine, there was a significant correlation between reductions in pain intensity and blood level achieved. In the majority of subjects who reported definite pain relief, allodynia also disappeared.

In closing, it is important to note that the indications for liver transplantation are not static but rather are remarkably dynamic and capable of change over time. Thus yesterday's major indications can become relative contraindications, while yesterday's absolute contraindications have become today's nuisances. The goal for physicians who care for individuals with problems such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic cancer should be to develop new strategies of care that will ultimately eliminate these diseases as problems, rather than eliminating individuals with such health problems from currently available health options. In other words, physicians who accept the responsibility for a patient's life should be searching for the best form of therapy available for their patient rather than examining the reasons that exist for limiting one's choice in health care.",Virus_Diseases

"Long acting drug combinations in rheumatoid arthritis: a formal overview. We compared the benefits and risks of combinations of long acting antirheumatic drugs with those of the same drugs used singly in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We searched the literature through MEDLINE (1966-89), Index Medicus (1956-65), Excerpta Medica (1982-89), Science Citation Index (1982-89), and bibliographic review of located articles. Of a total of 341 citations, we identified 7 prospective trials that specifically addressed the stated purpose. We independently assessed the quality of the selected trials, using published methodological criteria and summarized the effect of treatment on arthritis activity and the incidence of side effects. The trials we evaluated tested various drug combinations. Because of deficiencies in methods and reporting, only 3 trials had sufficient quality to yield strong or moderately strong evidence. None conclusively demonstrated benefit of a drug combination: 2 suggested such benefit, including 1 also suggesting increased toxicity; the 3rd suggested only increased toxicity. The other 4 trials yielded weak evidence to support both increased efficacy and toxicity. The advantages of any antirheumatic drug combination remain unproven. Because these advantages are likely to be modest, they can only be shown in rigorously designed trials enrolling large numbers of patients.

"Role of nasal allergy in chronic maxillary sinusitis--diagnostic value of nasal challenge with allergen. The role of nasal allergy in chronic maxillary sinusitis without an air-fluid level was studied in 37 patients. Seventy-three nasal provocation tests with various inhalant allergens were performed in 37 patients by means of rhinomanometry, and maxillary sinus radiographs were performed before and repeatedly after the allergen challenge. Forty-one positive nasal responses (NRs) occurred in 29 patients; 13 were immediate only, 18 were late only, and 10 NRs were dual responses. Of these responses, 32 demonstrated radiographic changes, primarily an increase in mucosal edema and/or opacification. These responses were accompanied by increased pressure in the maxillary sinuses, acute headache, and sometimes otalgia. Eight patients did not develop any NRs; however, increased thickening of the mucosal membrane of the maxillary sinuses, accompanied by subjective symptoms, was recorded in three of these nonresponders.

"Occurrence of groups A and B of respiratory syncytial virus over 15 years: associated epidemiologic and clinical characteristics in hospitalized and ambulatory children. Over 15 years respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) isolates from 1209 hospitalized and ambulatory children were examined for strain group and in a subset for subgroup to determine the associated epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. Three patterns of yearly outbreaks existed: (1) strong predominance of group A strains (9 years with 83%-100% A strains), (2) relatively equal proportions of group A and B strains (4 years), and (3) strong predominance of group B strains (78%-85%) in 2 years, separated by a decade. The first pattern of highly dominant A strains occurred in cycles of 1 or 2 consecutive years with a single intervening year in which B strains were greater than or equal to 40% of the isolates. Subgroups A1 and A2 predominated, while B2, 3, and 4 occurred almost equally. A greater clinical severity for Group A strains was suggested by children with group A infections requiring intensive care significantly more often (15.4 vs. 8.3%, P = .008). Further, strongly dominant A strain years were associated with higher proportions of RSV admissions requiring intensive care (16.6% vs. 5.5%, P less than .01).

The morbidity associated with dengue infection on Hainan Island was 1,913 per 100,000 residents, with a case fatality rate of 0.25%. Severe disease was more prevalent in the 10-29-year-old age group. Principal clinical features in laboratory-confirmed cases were fever, osteoarthralgia, hemorrhage and/or shock, and thrombocytopenia. Complications such as acute intravascular hemolysis, diffuse intravascular coagulation, hemoconcentration, pleural effusion, altered mentality, and pneumonia were also observed. One hundred twenty-five isolates of dengue 2 virus were recovered from acute-phase serum samples from 278 patients, and 5 strains of this same virus serotype were isolated from 5 pools of adult Ae. aegypti.",Virus_Diseases
"Two- to four-year results of posterior cruciate-sparing condylar total knee arthroplasty with an uncemented femoral component. One hundred fourteen hybrid Press-Fit Condylar total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were reviewed an average of 2.8 years after surgery to determine if this method of implantation provided satisfactory results compared with conventional cemented TKAs. Ninety-three percent of the knees had good or excellent results, and 94% of the knees had at most only mild or occasional pain. One knee with a metal-backed patella was revised for mechanical failure of the patellar button. Roentgenographic analysis of the femoral component interface showed that 30% of knees had a radiolucent line in at least one zone. However, none of the lines was wider than 1 mm, and none was about the central stem. There were no signs of loosening about any of the components. It was concluded that hybrid TKA provides a good and predictable result that is comparable to cemented TKA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Treatment of brittle fingernails and onychoschizia with biotin: scanning electron microscopy. Pathologic hoof changes in horses and swine can be normalized by administration of biotin. This vitamin has been given orally to women with brittle fingernails or onychoschizia. The aim of the study was to test whether the favorable clinical results could be corroborated by scanning electron microscopy. We investigated the distal ends of the fingernails from 32 persons. They were placed into three groups: group A consisted of 10 control subjects with normal nails, group B comprised eight patients with brittle nails studied before and after biotin treatment, and group C was 14 patients with brittle nails in whom the administration of biotin did not coincide exactly with the initial and terminal clipping of the nails. The thickness of the nails in group B increased significantly by 25%. In group C, the increase was 7%. Splitting of the nails were reduced in groups B and C and the irregular cellular arrangement of the dorsal surface of brittle nails became more regular in all nails of group B and in 8 of 11 nails of group C.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Routine prenatal screening for HIV infection  Guidelines in most developed countries for testing pregnant women for HIV infection recommend that screening should be directed to groups with acknowledged risk factors for infection. Our prospective study of HIV seroprevalence among 2724 pregnant women in an inner-city area of Baltimore, USA, showed that if these guidelines had been applied only 57% of HIV-seropositive women would have been detected. By offering counselling and HIV testing to all pregnant women, the detection rate was raised to 87%. We conclude that screening directed at women who admit risk factors is not effective in identifying HIV-infected women and that routine HIV screening should be offered to all pregnant women.",Virus_Diseases

"Collagenous colitis: report of nine cases and review of the literature. Collagenous colitis is characterized clinically by chronic watery diarrhea and pathologically by a distinctive band of collagen deposited below the colonic epithelium and an inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lamina propria. Since 1976, more than 100 cases have been described. We report an additional nine cases occurring in five women and four men ranging in age from 18 to 80 years. Diarrhea was present before diagnosis for 2 to 4 months in four cases and for 1 to 25 years in another four cases. One patient did not have diarrhea. Results of radiologic and stool studies were normal in all cases. All patients had flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Microscopic examination of biopsy material was interpreted as characteristic of collagenous colitis. Two cases resolved with psyllium mucilloid therapy alone.

"Efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on neutropenia in patients with AIDS. The efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) on neutropenia was evaluated in 14 patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC). In all patients, including 11 neutropenic patients, 100 or 200 micrograms/m2 of rhG-CSF significantly increased the neutrophil counts. The response was greater in patients with higher neutrophil counts before the treatment, and was also dose-dependent. Although the effect seemed to be less potent, the agent also increased the neutrophil counts even when zidovudine (azidothymidine, AZT) and other myelosuppressive antiviral agents were administered simultaneously. These observations indicate that rhG-CSF may be beneficial in preventing and treating some secondary infections, and will make it easier to continue therapy with antiviral agents in patients with AIDS or ARC.",Virus_Diseases
"Quantification of allergic and irritant patch test reactions using laser-Doppler flowmetry and erythema index. The laser-Doppler blood flow and erythema index were assessed in 16 patch test reactions caused by irritants (1% aq. sodium lauryl sulphate and 1% aq. benzalkonium chloride) and in 13 varied allergic reactions, at 2 or 4 days. Both irritant and allergic responses produced statistically significant increases in laser-Doppler flow index and erythema index compared to control sites (p less than 0.05 or less, using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). A disproportionately greater increase in erythema index than in laser-Doppler flow was seen in mild irritant reactions, compared to allergic, though the two could not be reliably distinguished by these tests. 2 non-allergic nickel sulphate sites produced an increase in both blood flow and erythema without any clinical change. Petrolatum alone produced no significant change in either measurement. The laser-Doppler flow showed an overall correlation with the erythema index (product moment method; r = 0.55, p less than 0.001), but there was little correlation between these indices and patch test reactivity as judged clinically by conventional scoring. Generally, allergic and irritant patch test reactions could not be differentiated on the basis of laser-Doppler flow or erythema index. However, the disproportionate increase in erythema index over laser-Doppler flow index for mild irritant responses warrants further study in other irritant models.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Vaginal adenosis and clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina occurred in a 44-year-old woman after treatment for condylomata acuminata. She had no known exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero. Biopsy-proven vaginal adenosis appeared 8 months after intravaginal 5-fluorouracil application for recurrent urogenital condylomata acuminata. Forty months later, biopsies showed residual adenosis with foci of clear cell adenocarcinoma. Although clear cell adenocarcinoma is associated with vaginal adenosis and cervical ectropion in DES-exposed women, its occurrence in adenosis after 5-fluorouracil therapy has not been reported to the authors' knowledge.

"Epidemiology of encephalitis in children: a 20-year survey. Four hundred five children from the Helsinki area who were 1 month to 16 years old were treated for acute encephalitis at the Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, from January 1968 through December 1987. Encephalitis occurred most commonly in children 1 to 1.9 years of age, among whom the incidence was 16.7 per 100,000 child-years. The incidence remained quite high until the age of 10 years, and then gradually declined to 1.0 per 100,000 child-years at the age of 15 years. Since 1983, when mumps, measles, and rubella vaccination eradicated the encephalitides associated with these microbes, the major associated agents have been varicella-zoster, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory and enteroviruses. In infants younger than 1 year of age, the major agents were enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and the group of ""others,"" whereas in older children, respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as varicella-zoster virus, dominated. In children aged 1 to 11 months, the causal agent could not be identified in one-half of all cases, whereas in children who were at least 10 years old, the etiology remained unknown in only one-fourth of cases. Male dominance was most evident in the 4- to 9-year age group. The difference in etiology between males and females was significant (p = 0.02); mumps and varicella were more common in boys, and adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were more common in girls. The overall male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1. Characteristic seasonal variation occurred in encephalitides associated with mumps, measles, and entero- and respiratory viruses.",Virus_Diseases

Five feet had sustained an injury, tumours were found in three and there was no obvious cause in nine. In most cases in need of operative treatment, there was a space-occupying lesion. Classifying the results according to causes, those with coalition or a tumour fared better, and idiopathic and traumatic cases had a worse outcome.

"Effect of parenterally administered gold therapy on the course of adult rheumatoid arthritis  OBJECTIVE: To describe the course of rheumatoid arthritis over 5 years in adults and to evaluate the effect of parenterally administered gold salts on that course. DESIGN: A prospective observational study of adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Data derived from annual interviews with patients from 1983 to 1988 and from physician surveys in 1983 and 1987. SETTING: Rheumatology practices in the community. PATIENTS: The study began in 1982 with 822 adults who had rheumatoid arthritis and were under the care of rheumatologists. INTERVENTIONS: Those selected by rheumatologists in the management of their patients. MEASUREMENTS: Information describing sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, course, and therapy was collected from patients and verified by physician reports. Functional status, measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and the number of painful joints were used as outcome variables. Outcome variables were adjusted for age, sex, disease duration, baseline values of the outcome variable, and the use of four disease-remittive agents other than gold. MAIN RESULTS: Multivariate repeated-measures analysis of variance showed no change in the course of rheumatoid arthritis over 5 years. The use of parenteral gold for at least 2 consecutive years at the start of the observation period produced, on average, no change in the course over 5 years in the two outcome variables. CONCLUSION: In our study of a community-based population of adults with rheumatoid arthritis who were under the care of community rheumatologists, we found that there was, on average, no statistically significant change in function or number of painful joints between 1983 and 1988. Patients receiving parenteral gold therapy for at least 2 consecutive years did not show a statistically significant difference in outcome when compared with those not receiving such therapy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A hospital-based study of acute viral infections of the respiratory tract in Thai children, with emphasis on laboratory diagnosis. The hospital-based study described here examined the viruses found in 738 children less than 5 years old who presented at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, from January 1986 to December 1987 with acute respiratory tract infections. Three methods for detection of viral infection are compared: direct examination of epithelial cells of the respiratory tract with the use of fluorescent antibody staining, isolation of virus, and measurement of antibody in acute- and convalescent-phase sera. Viral infections were found in 44.7% of the study population. Diagnosis by the examination of epithelial cells with the fluorescent antibody staining procedure was found to have several deficiencies; however, this technique was the most sensitive for diagnosis of infection due to respiratory syncytial virus. Isolation of virus was the best method for identification of adenoviruses, parainfluenza 1 and 3 viruses, and influenza B virus. Problems associated with serodiagnosis included failure to obtain specimens of convalescent-phase blood in 24.5% of cases and insensitivity of serodiagnosis for young children except for the identification of antibody to influenza A virus. The combination of all three tests yielded the best rate of detection of virus.",Virus_Diseases
"Valgus deformities of the feet and characteristics of gait in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis. To investigate the cause of valgus deformity of the hindfoot in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis and to characterize the effects of the deformity on gait, two groups of patients were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and with gait analysis in the laboratory. Group 1 consisted of seven patients who had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and normal alignment of the feet and Group 2, of ten patients who had rheumatoid arthritis and valgus deformity of the hindfoot. In Group 2, the disease was of longer duration and the feet were more painful than in Group 1. There was no evidence of muscular imbalance, equinus contracture, valgus deformity of the tibiotalar joint, or isolated deficiency of the tibialis posterior (such as weakness, tenosynovitis, or rupture of the tendon) that could have contributed to the development of the valgus deformity. In the patients who had valgus deformity, quantitated electromyography demonstrated that the intensity and duration of activity of the tibialis posterior was significantly increased, apparently in an effort to support the collapsing longitudinal arch of the foot. Gait studies revealed decreases in velocity, stride length, and single-limb-support time, as well as delayed heel-rise in both groups, but the decreases were more marked in the patients who had valgus deformity. The results of this study suggest that valgus deformity of the hindfoot in rheumatoid patients results from exaggerated pronation forces on the weakened and inflamed subtalar joint. These forces are caused by alterations in gait secondary to symmetrical muscular weakness and the effort of the patient to minimize pain in the feet. Radiographs also suggested an association between the valgus deformity of the feet and valgus deformity of the knees in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Trends in survival of Danish AIDS patients from 1981 to 1989. Length of survival was analysed in relation to year of diagnosis, AIDS-indicative disease, age, risk behaviour, zidovudine therapy, and CD4 cell count and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels at the time of diagnosis in a group of 231 consecutive adult Danish AIDS patients reported before 1 January 1988. The cumulative survival rate was 53% (95% confidence interval 47-59%) at 1 year, 29% (22-36%) at 2 years and 18% (10-26%) at 3 years. Length of survival increased significantly (P less than 0.001) over time for patients who were initially diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), 17% (3-31%) at 2 years prior to 1986, 32% (16-49%) in 1986 and 52% (34-69%) in 1987, whereas survival remained stable for patients with other AIDS-indicative diseases. Survival was similar for patients who were diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma alone and PCP alone. Independent predictors of a shortened survival were a CD4 cell count less than 200 x 10(6)/l, a serum IgA level greater than 4 g/l, and an initial diagnosis with opportunistic infections other than PCP. In addition, the multivariate analysis suggested an improved survival in recent years for patients diagnosed with PCP, independent of other factors examined. We conclude that length of survival in AIDS patients is highly variable. Determinants of progression include CD4 cell count, serum IgA level, and presenting disease. Survival has increased markedly for patients with PCP and median survival now exceeds 24 months.",Virus_Diseases
"In vivo leukocyte migration in arthritis. We quantitated in vivo migration of neutrophils into the knees of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis, using 99mtechnetium-hexamethyl-propylene-amineoxime-labeled leukocytes and gamma scintigraphy. Significant neutrophil migration occurred in patients with RA irrespective of disease duration, and it was reduced by 60% following intraarticular steroid injection. The reduction in neutrophil migration correlated with reduction in pain. Leukocyte migration into osteoarthritic joints was also demonstrated, although it was much less than that seen in rheumatoid joints. No significant leukocyte migration into the joints of patients without arthritis was demonstrated. This technique appears to provide a sensitive method for quantitatively assessing the neutrophil component of inflammation in individual joints of patients with arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Liposomal encapsulation of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) results in decreased bone marrow toxicity and enhanced activity against murine AIDS-induced immunosuppression. The effect of liposome encapsulation on the bone marrow toxicity and antiviral activity of AZT in C57BL/6 mice was determined. Liposomal encapsulation of AZT enhanced localization in the liver, spleen, and lung, and reduced localization in bone marrow. AZT administered i.v. (0.08-50 mg/kg/day) had significant bone marrow toxicity (30-50% reduction in cellularity) after five injections, maximum toxicity occurring at greater than or equal to 2 mg/kg/day. Parallel reductions in the number of erythrocytes and leukocytes were observed. AZT encapsulated in liposomes had no bone marrow toxicity at doses of 0.08-10 mg/kg/day, and erythrocyte and leukocyte numbers remained normal. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus suppressed T- and B-cell mitogenic responses. Treatment of LP-BM5 retrovirus-infected mice with 2 mg/kg AZT three times weekly partially protected the mitogenic response at 4 but not at 7 weeks postinfection. Treatment with liposomal AZT resulted in normal T- and B-cell mitogenic responses at both 4 and 7 weeks postinfection.",Virus_Diseases

"Genomic, phenotypic, and functional analyses of T cells in patients with psoriasis undergoing systemic cyclosporin A treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that cyclosporin A (CyA) exerts a beneficial effect on psoriasis. It remains unclear, however, whether T-cell immune responses are definitely impaired in psoriasis and whether the anti-psoriatic effect of CyA is mediated by interference with T-cell activation. To study these questions, 20 patients with severe psoriasis were treated with oral CyA (5 mg/kg/d) for 12 weeks and examined for several phenotypic and functional properties of peripheral blood T cells before and after therapy. The analyses included CD3, CD4, and CD8 phenotypes, IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor expression following Con A stimulation, proliferative responses to PHA, and in vivo responsiveness to a foreign antigen, PPD. When the values of patients before therapy and healthy individuals were compared, no statistically significant differences were detected in any of these analyses. Furthermore, none of these T-cell properties were changed after 12 weeks of treatment. To assess possible minor mutations in T-cell-related genes in psoriasis, the T-cell receptor beta-chain locus was analyzed by Southern hybridization. With a cDNA probe for C beta 1, a polymorphic fragment of congruent to 9 kb was detected in Eco RI digests in one of 20 patients and in four of 10 healthy individuals examined. No polymorphism was detected in Bam HI digests in any individual. These results fail to support the hypothesis that a general or ""systemic"" alteration in T-cell immunity plays a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and in the action of CyA against this skin disorder.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Salivary function of persons with hereditary epidermolysis bullosa. Oral alterations of the hard and/or soft tissues are commonly associated with the different types of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). The relationship of oral soft and hard tissue changes to the disease mechanisms in different EB types remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate selected aspects of salivary function in a healthy control population and in persons affected with different types of EB. Sixty-one patients with EB, representing all the major types of EB, and 36 unaffected persons were examined to measure their stimulated salivary flow rates and salivary levels of IgA, albumin, and total protein. Our results show that none of the types of EB demonstrated a decreased salivary flow rate. However, patients with recessive dystrophic EB had significantly elevated salivary IgA, albumin, and total protein levels. The increased IgA level seen in this form of EB appears most likely to be related to the high prevalence of oral blistering rather than the result of altered mucosal immune function. Despite severe cutaneous and extracutaneous involvement associated with inherited EB, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis of abnormal salivary function or mucosal immunity in this disease. Taken together, these findings suggest that the rampant dental caries seen in the severe forms of EB are likely attributable to nonsalivary factors such as enamel involvement, soft tissue alterations, and/or diet. Alternatively, there may be mucosal immunity or salivary enzyme alterations that influence oral disease in these patients, but these were not evaluated in this investigation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evaluation, treatment, and follow-up results of post polio patients with dysphagia. Twenty consecutive patients were evaluated for reports of dysphagia from post-polio clinics. Only half the patients reported a history of swallowing problems at the time of their acute poliomyelitis. Each patient received a videofluorographic evaluation of the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, and then was provided with recommendations to improve swallowing skills. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to all patients. The respondents had an average interval of 12 months since the initial evaluation. Of the 18 patients responding to the questionnaire, 14 (77%) reported regular use of the swallowing suggestions. Comparison of pre-evaluation results to followup of the 18 respondents yielded a statistically significant decline in the frequency of choking (p = 0.0156) and food sticking in the throat (p = 0.0195). We conclude that a dysphagia program can result in significant improvement of the swallowing symptoms reported with the post-polio population.",Virus_Diseases
"Pharmacokinetics of R 82913 in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex. R 82913, a tetrahydroimidazobenzodiazepinthione (TIBO) derivative with potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in vitro, was given to 22 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex in a dose-escalating pilot study. Doses of 10 to 300 mg administered daily by intravenous infusion were well tolerated for up to 50 weeks, with no haematological or biochemical evidence of toxicity. Mean OKT4 cell count rose slightly during the second month of treatment when higher steady-state plasma concentrations of the drug were achieved. Median p24 antigen concentration fell by 41% during the first month of therapy. When the rise in p24 antigen before therapy was compared to the fall during treatment, end-point analysis showed a significant difference (p less than 0.03). The combination of potent antiretroviral activity in vitro and the observed effect on HIV p24 antigen and absence of toxicity in vivo indicate that R 82913 and related TIBO derivatives merit further study in the treatment of retroviral infections.",Virus_Diseases

"A mouse model for investigating the molecular pathogenesis of adenovirus pneumonia. Intranasal inoculation of type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) produced pneumonia in mice even though the virus did not replicate. To induce the pneumonia, however, a large viral infectious dose was required--i.e., 10(10) plaque-forming units. Four strains of inbred mouse were studied (C57BL/6N, C57BL/10ScN, CBA/N, and C3H/N): all showed similar inflammatory responses, although the greatest infiltration occurred in the C57BL/6N mice. The pathological response to Ad5 infection resembled that previously described in cotton rats: it consisted of overlapping early and late phases, and the infiltration contained primarily lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages with a scattering of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The prominent early phase and the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes suggested that induction of cytokines may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this pneumonia. Assays showed the appearance of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and IL-6 in the infected mouse lungs concomitant with the developing early-phase infiltration. Only IL-6 was found in the peripheral blood. IL-6 reached maximum titers 6-24 hr after infection, whereas maximum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 were attained 2-3 days after infection. Specific RNAs for each of these cytokines were demonstrated in the infected lungs. To test the hypothesis that a cytotoxic T-cell response was responsible for the second phase, which primarily consisted of a perivascular and peribronchial infiltration of lymphocytes, Ad5 was used to infect C57BL/10ScN Nu/Nu and parent mice. The nude mice showed a normal early-phase response, but essentially no peribronchial and only minimal perivascular infiltrations occurred.",Virus_Diseases

Treatment with the antiandrogen flutamide (250 mg twice daily) and an oral contraceptive (Ortho 1/35) resulted in a particularly rapid and marked decrease in the total hirsutism score, which reached the normal range at 7 months. Seborrhea, acne, and hair loss score were also rapidly corrected. Treatment was associated with a decrease in plasma luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and estradiol levels.

"Use of computerised general practice data for population surveillance: comparative study of influenza data  OBJECTIVE--To assess the potential for using routine computerised general practice data for surveillance of illness. DESIGN--Comparison of the incidence of influenza during the 1989 epidemic derived from a computerised database with that derived from the Royal College of General Practitioners's weekly returns service--a well established predominantly manual surveillance system. SETTING--433 general practices throughout the United Kingdom that used a commercial computer system linked to a central databank. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Incidence of influenza. RESULTS--The slope of the influenza epidemic curve was essentially the same whether derived from the routine computerised data or royal college's weekly returns service data, and the computerised data were geographically consistent. Throughout the study period, however, the computer derived incidence was between one third and one quarter of that derived from the royal college's system (which is served by practitioners trained in surveillance methods). The peak weekly rates were 164 cases per 100,000 for the computerised system and 583 cases per 100,000 for the royal college's surveillance system. CONCLUSIONS--The apparent underreporting in the routine computerised data probably reflects lack of motivation and experience in disease surveillance and haphazard computer entry (particularly of consultations that took place outside of the surgery and consultations that did not result in a prescription), along with overestimation of the population under surveillance. Nevertheless, routine computerised surveillance allows rapid data collection from a large number of practices over a wide geographical area and would greatly augment existing methods.",Virus_Diseases
"Immune function and anti-HTLV-I/II status in anti-HIV-1-negative intravenous drug users receiving methadone. PURPOSE: The study objective was to evaluate the effects of long-term methadone use and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II seropositivity on the distribution of lymphocyte subsets and on lymphocyte function as measured in vitro in intravenous drug users seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anti-HIV-1-negative intravenous drug users receiving methadone maintenance therapy (n = 24) were studied in a Veterans Administration drug abuse treatment center. These subjects were compared to 38 age- and sex-matched control subjects who did not abuse drugs. HIV-1 and HTLV serostatus was determined by repetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by immunoblot. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by two-color flow cytometry. Lymphocyte function was measured by proliferative response to plant mitogens and by natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity to a tumor cell target. RESULTS: Significant differences were seen in lymphocyte phenotype in the methadone-treated group, with elevations in the T-cell helper subset CD4+CD26+; in CD8 and CD8+I2+ cells, suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and activated suppressor/cytotoxic T cells; and in CD2+CD26+ cells and activated total T lymphocytes. Lymphocyte function was suppressed in the methadone group, with poor responses to pokeweed mitogen and phytohemagglutinin in culture. Moreover, NK-cell cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in the methadone group. None of these immunologic differences were attributable to HTLV serostatus. CONCLUSION: The immune abnormalities seen suggest that a clinically significant degree of immune impairment exists in methadone-treated intravenous drug users. However, these abnormalities could not be explained by the presence of other retroviruses in this HIV-1-negative study group, as there was no significant difference in immune function when HTLV-seropositive patients were compared to HTLV-seronegative subjects treated with methadone.",Virus_Diseases
"Epitopes of the HIV-1-negative factor (nef) reactive with murine monoclonal antibodies and human HIV-1-positive sera. Murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against a recombinant nef protein fragment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain BH10 were characterized by an epitope mapping system using overlapping decapeptides. Four different immunogenic regions were identified. Ten human HIV-1-positive sera were tested in the same epitope mapping system, seven of these were reactive with four immunogenic regions. Two of the nef-specific epitopes recognized by human sera overlapped with the epitopes defined by the murine monoclonal antibodies. The reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies with the recombinant nef protein and with infected and uninfected cells were investigated in a variety of test systems. The results are discussed with respect to homologous regions of nef and cellular proteins.",Virus_Diseases
"Thrombotic vasculopathy associated with cryofibrinogenemia. Cryofibrinogenemia refers to the presence of cold-precipitable plasma proteins associated with a variety of disorders, including malignancies, inflammatory processes, and thrombohemorrhagic phenomena. Few cases of essential or primary cryofibrinogenemia are reported. We report a case in a 48-year-old man of essential cryofibrinogenemia and hemorrhagic necrosis of the ears and of the upper and lower extremities. Histopathologic studies demonstrated extensive eosinophilic thrombi in the dermal vasculature, with minimal inflammation and no vasculitis. Cryofibrinogenemia should be considered in the investigation of patients with otherwise unexplained cold intolerance and dermal thrombosis associated with minimal or no inflammation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"'Irritants' increase the response to an allergen in allergic contact dermatitis. We studied the effect of ""irritants"" on the response to an allergen in 15 patients. Dilutions of allergens were applied in duplicate, and 24 hours later they were removed and sodium lauryl sulfate (11 subjects) or anthralin (dithranol) (four subjects) was applied for a further 24 hours to one set of patches. Control dilutions of irritants alone were applied. Responses were measured objectively at 72 hours. The response to both allergen and irritant was greater than to either alone. Doses of allergen, which did not produce a response when applied alone, produced a response when an irritant was added. Irritants therefore increase the allergic contact dermatitis response and may explain the presence of contact dermatitis in patients with negative patch tests.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Do non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase colonic permeability? Urinary excretion of orally administered lactulose and 51 chromium labelled ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (51Cr-EDTA) was measured in 12 healthy adult subjects and in six patients with ileostomies to assess intestinal permeability. In normal subjects, 24 hour urinary recovery of 51Cr-EDTA was significantly greater than that of lactulose (mean (SEM) 2.27 (0.15) v 0.50 (0.08)% oral dose; p less than 0.001), but in ileostomy patients recovery of the two markers was the same. In normal subjects, therefore, the difference between the two markers may arise from bacterial break-down of lactulose but not of 51Cr-EDTA in the distal bowel, urinary excretion of lactulose representing small intestinal permeation and that of 51Cr-EDTA representing both small and large intestinal permeation. The markers were then given simultaneously to nine patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The 24 hour urinary recovery of 51Cr-EDTA in the patients was significantly greater than normal (4.64 (1.20) v 2.27 (0.15)% oral dose; p less than 0.01), but that of lactulose was not significantly affected. Moreover, the increase in 51Cr-EDTA recovery was most noticeable in the later urine collections. Both of these findings suggest that NSAIDs may increase colonic permeability.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Lagophthalmos caused by trauma or inflammation may damage the cornea and, if not adequately treated, may result in loss of eyesight. Hence surgical intervention is required at the earliest possible stage. We have developed a subcutaneous pedicle flap elevated from the temporozygomatic area and rotated 180 degrees around a small pedicle base that contains the orbicularis oculi muscle. With this flap, the entire upper eyelid can be reconstructed as an aesthetic unit in one stage so that the result is satisfactory not only functionally, but also cosmetically.

Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVsm) isolation from blood and brain of experimentally infected macaques. The possibility of using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques to study pathogenic events linked to HIV infection of the brain prompted us to investigate some of the virological features in SIV-infected macaques. Nine cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with SIVsm and killed at different times. We successfully isolated virus from the blood of all the animals and from the brains of eight. These results point to the early and regular spread of this lentivirus to the brain. Neutralizing activity was studied in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained from these macaques against a selected group of isolates. Cerebrospinal fluid did not show any neutralizing activity. Our findings integrate the observations from HIV-1 infection in man and indicate that SIV infection of macaques is a useful model for studying pathogenic events of brain infection.,Virus_Diseases
"An analysis of the economic impact of HIV infection among patients at Mama Yemo Hospital, Kinshasa, Zaire. In a prospective study of adult admissions to the Department of Internal Medicine at Mama Yemo Hospital, Kinshasa, Zaire in late 1988, 129 women and 122 men were screened for HIV infection. Fifty per cent were found to be seropositive, with half of the seropositives meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical AIDS definition. The HIV seropositives had a mortality rate of 50%, which was significantly higher (P = 0.004) than the 30% mortality rate seen in the seronegative group. Direct costs during hospitalization did not differ ($60.30 for HIV seropositives, $56.50 for HIV seronegatives), but pre-hospitalization expenses were significantly higher in the HIV-seropositive group ($170 for HIV seropositives, $110 for HIV seronegatives). Years of productive life lost due to death were also significantly higher for HIV seropositives versus HIV seronegatives (30.6 versus 21.3 years; P = 0.0007), and 73% of the premature mortality in the study population was attributable to HIV infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Sulfadiazine crystalluria revisited. The treatment of Toxoplasma encephalitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis is an important opportunistic infection in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, estimated to occur in 20,000 to 40,000 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in the United States by 1991. The combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine is regarded as the treatment of choice. Acute renal failure due to crystal deposition in the urinary tract was well described 30 to 40 years ago and is likely to resurface as a clinical entity if appropriate prophylactic measures are not taken. We describe two cases of sulfadiazine-induced crystalluria and renal failure in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, review the pertinent literature, and discuss the pathogenesis. Recommendations are made for the prophylaxis and treatment of sulfadiazine-related renal toxic reaction. Physicians using this ""new"" drug must be aware of the potential danger of sulfonamide-induced injury to the urinary tract.",Virus_Diseases

"Antibody to interleukin 1 inhibits the cartilage degradative and thymocyte proliferative actions of rheumatoid synovial culture medium. Cartilage breakdown in rheumatoid arthritis results from (a) lytic action by synovial enzymes, and (b) release of synovial catabolin, now believed to be a form of interleukin 1 (IL-1), causing chondrocytes to degrade their matrix. Rheumatoid synovial culture media were tested for their ability to stimulate cartilage degradation (proteoglycan release from bovine nasal cartilage discs) and thymocyte proliferation (3H-thymidine incorporation) in the absence or presence of anti-IL-1. Degradation of living cartilage, stimulated 2-fold by synovial culture media, was inhibited up to 80% by anti-IL-1. Residual breakdown in living cartilage and synovial culture media induced breakdown in dead cultures were of similar magnitude, and both were unaffected by antibody treatment. Proteoglycan products released from synovial culture media treated cartilage were of smaller average molecular weight (Sepharose CL-2B), and such size reduction was inhibited by anti-IL-1 treatment. Synovial culture media that stimulated cartilage degradation also stimulated thymocyte proliferation; the latter was fully suppressible by anti-IL-1. One of 8 synovial culture media contained an inhibitor(s) of thymocyte proliferation, removable by dialysis. We conclude (1) rheumatoid synovial catabolin activity is due to a form of IL-1. (2) A minor nonsuppressible component of synovial culture media stimulated breakdown, identical in living and killed cartilage, is due to passive transfer of enzymic activity. (3) Cultured rheumatoid synovium releases both IL-1 and an inhibitor(s) of IL-1 action.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Human immunodeficiency virus and the primary care physician. As the scope and size of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic grows, the primary care physician will need to assume a greater role. A knowledge of HIV risk factors and the ability to perform pretest and posttest counseling for HIV testing is essential. Counseling patients on HIV risk reduction should be part of the HIV risk interview. An understanding of the benefits and contraindications of testing, as well as a respect for the impact of testing, is important. All HIV-seropositive individuals should undergo a complete history and review of symptoms as soon as test results are known. Judicious use of laboratory testing, including monitoring of CD4 cell counts, is recommended. Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis and zidovudine therapy should be offered to patients with appropriately low CD4 counts.",Virus_Diseases
"Early solid feeding and recurrent childhood eczema: a 10-year longitudinal study. The relationship between early solid feeding practices and risks of recurrent or chronic eczema in childhood was examined in a birth cohort of New Zealand children studied to the age of 10. By the age of 10 years, 7.5% of children had chronic or recurrent eczema. There were clear and consistent associations between the diversity of the child's diet during the first 4 months and risks of eczema. Even when due allowance was made for a range of confounding factors--including parental atopic illness, atopic illness in siblings, the child's early milk diet, and family social background--children exposed to four or more different types of solid food before 4 months had risks of recurrent or chronic eczema that were 2.9 times those of children who were not exposed to early solid feeding. It is concluded that early exposure to a diet diverse in potential food antigens may act to predispose susceptible children to recurrent or chronic childhood eczema.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Iliac insufficiency fractures. Twenty-five post-menopausal women with one or more insufficiency fractures of the pelvic ring are reported. In 80% of cases the fractures were multiple and a total of 79 insufficiency fractures was identified. Twelve iliac insufficiency fractures were present in 11 patients located at one of three sites: above and parallel to the acetabular roof (""supra-acetabular""), extending diagonally across the iliac ala from the greater sciatic notch (""oblique iliac""), and adjacent to the sacro-iliac joint (""superomedial iliac""). The plain radiographic appearances of these iliac fractures were typically subtle with ill defined medullary sclerosis, due to trabecular compression, the cardinal sign. Scintigraphy revealed the fractures as foci of increased activity which, in the presence of multiple pelvic insufficiency fractures, may be mistaken for metastatic disease. Computed tomography can be helpful in confirming the presence of suspected fractures, revealing further occult fractures and also excluding the likelihood of malignancy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Detection of human T-cell leukemia virus type I proviral sequences from fixed tissues of seropositive patients. Fixed lymphoma tissues from 11 patients seropositive for human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) antibodies were analyzed for proviral sequences by the polymerase chain reaction. Typical adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomas (ATLLs) from nine patients were positive for HTLV-I sequences. In contrast, one of two lymphomas with immunophenotypes atypical for ATLL was negative for HTLV-I. This HTLV-I DNA-negative lymphoma, although present in an HTLV-I-seropositive patient, was therefore reclassified. The HTLV-I tax gene was always detected in the ATLL tissues, whereas segments of the pol gene were not detected in half the cases. These studies demonstrate that fixed non-ATLL specimens can be distinguished from ATLL specimens.",Virus_Diseases
"Psychological functioning in a cohort of gay men at risk for AIDS. A three-year descriptive study. This study describes the mental health of a large cohort of gay men participating in the Chicago Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study/Coping and Change Study. Six biannual questionnaires were self-administered between 1984 and 1988. General mental health was determined by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL). An abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale (CESD-5) and an adapted Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) question also measured depression. Suicidal ideation was assessed by one question in the HSCL. AIDS-specific distress was determined by three subscales specifically developed for this study. While mean HSCL and CESD-5 scores were stable during the observational period, AIDS-specific distress increased over time. The HSCL scores for the cohort were somewhat elevated above general population norms but considerably below psychiatric outpatient norms. Fewer than 12% of the men reported elevated HSCL or CESD-5 scores three or more times. A self-reported episode of depression of two weeks or more, measured by the DIS screening question, was experienced by 40.1% of the sample. Suicidal ideation was reported on three or more visits by 18.8% of the men. The younger members of this cohort exhibit greater general and AIDS-specific distress. Income was inversely associated with general distress. HIV-seropositive participants had generally higher AIDS-specific distress scores than those who were seronegative, but their scores were equivalent on the HSCL and CESD-5.",Virus_Diseases
"Contact dermatitis due to topical treatment with garlic in Hong Kong. Contact dermatitis due to garlic is usually due to handling of garlic for cooking. Among the Chinese, garlic is also used as a form of topical medicament. 8 patients developed contact dermatitis after rubbing the cut end of a fresh garlic bulb onto the skin to treat fungal and other infections at the groin, neck, lower limb, hand or face. The distribution and morphology of the lesions were different from the classical form as described in the literature. Repeated open application tests with fresh garlic were all positive and patch tests with garlic extract were all negative. 5 controls tested by repeated open application with fresh garlic juice were also positive and patch tests in 10 controls with garlic extract were also negative. The results confirmed that the contact dermatitis was due to irritation. The patients were treated successfully with topical fluorinated steroid.

"Ranitidine in the treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug associated gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a multicentre study the effect of ranitidine on healing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) associated peptic ulcers was compared in a group of patients who had stopped NSAID treatment with another group who continued with NSAID treatment. A total of 190 patients with confirmed ulcers were randomised to continue or stop NSAID treatment. All patients in addition received ranitidine 150 mg twice daily. Patients were endoscopically monitored at four, eight, and 12 weeks. Gastric ulcers at eight weeks had healed in 63% of those taking NSAIDs compared with 95% of those who had stopped NSAID treatment. For duodenal ulcer the healing rates at eight weeks were 84% in the group continuing NSAIDs compared with 100% in those who stopped NSAIDs. The differences in healing rates were statistically significant for both gastric ulcer (p = 0.001) and for duodenal ulcer (p = 0.006). At 12 weeks, 79% of gastric ulcers and 92% of duodenal ulcers were healed in the group continuing with NSAIDs. All patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers who stopped taking NSAIDs were healed at 12 weeks. The study shows that ranitidine 150 mg twice daily effectively heals NSAID associated peptic ulcers. Healing is more successful when NSAID treatment stops but even if these drugs are continued, substantial healing rates are achievable.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The role of the mast cell in clinical gastrointestinal disease with special reference to systemic mastocytosis. The gastrointestinal tract is a rich source of mast cells with an enormous surface area that permits a high degree of interaction between the mast cell and intestinal luminal contents. The active metabolic products of the mast cell influence gastrointestinal secretion, absorption, and motility through paracrine effects of local mast cell degranulation and also cause systemic effects through the release of cellular products into the blood stream. Systemic mastocytosis influences physiologic function through the systemic effects of mast cell products released from focal (e.g., bone marrow) or wide spread increases in mast cell number. Local gastrointestinal proliferation of mast cells in response to recognized (e.g., gluten in celiac sprue) or obscure stimuli can alter gastrointestinal function and induce systemic symptoms. Celiac sprue, inflammatory bowel disease, and non-ulcer dyspepsia are three examples of gastrointestinal diseases in which mast cells can be implicated in the pathophysiology of the symptoms.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Possible deletion of a developmentally regulated heavy-chain variable region gene in autoimmune diseases. Several autoantibody-associated variable region (V) genes are preferentially expressed during early ontogenic development, suggesting strongly that they are of developmental and physiological importance. As such, it is possible that polymorphisms in one or more of these genes may alter susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We have searched extensively for a probe related to a developmentally regulated V gene that has the power to differentiate among highly homologous V genes in human populations. Using such a probe (i.e., Humhv3005/P1) related to both anti-DNA and anti-IgG autoantibodies, we studied restriction fragment length polymorphisms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus and found an apparent heavy-chain V (VH) gene deletion that was nearly restricted to the autoimmune patients. These data suggest that deletions of physiologically important VH genes may increase the risk of autoimmunity through indirect effects on the development and homeostasis of the B-cell repertoire.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Limited heterogeneity of the HLA class II contribution to susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis is suggested by positive associations with HLA-DR4, DR1 and DRw10. Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) exhibit an HLA class II epitope found on most DR4 and DR1 molecules. We have investigated the possibility of other associations being present in the minority of patients lacking these antigens. One hundred and eighty patients with classical or definite RA and 100 controls were assigned HLA-DR, DQ and DP types by a DNA-based system using sequence-specific oligonucleotides to probe amplified class II alleles amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The expected associations with DR4 (relative risk 10, P less than 0.0001) and DR1 (relative risk 2.3, P less than 0.001) were observed and only 13% of individuals lacked both of these alleles compared with 54% of age- and race-matched controls. A significant association with DRw10 (P = 0.02) was also observed in the DR4/DR1-negative RA group (3/23 patients compared with 0/54 DR4/DR1-negative controls). No novel associations with other DR, DQ, or DP alleles were evident in contrast to some previous studies. The third allelic hypervariable region of the DR beta chain of DRw10 contains a similar amino acid sequence to that found in many DR4 and DR1 molecules. These results extend this correlation and suggest that this susceptibility determinant may account for the HLA-linked susceptibility in 89% of our cases of RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Recurrence of hepatitis C virus infection after orthotopic liver transplantation. Identification of the hepatitis C virus--the main cause of posttransfusion and sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis--and the development of a diagnostic serological test have allowed us to study possible recurrence of this type of hepatitis after liver transplantation. Six of 34 consecutive transplant recipients were found to have had antibodies to hepatitis C before transplantation. All six patients had possible exposure to hepatitis C through blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. Five of the six patients were positive for antibodies to hepatitis C after 1 yr of follow-up. Two of these patients had clinical and histological evidence of acute viral hepatitis in their allografts. In one patient this led to hepatic injury and dysfunction of two successive grafts. In contrast, none of the twenty-eight patients who were seronegative for hepatitis C virus antibodies before transplantation has converted to seropositivity after transplantation despite perioperative blood transfusions. These results suggest that hepatitis C diagnosed serologically recurs in a minority of transplant recipients and that de novo seroconversion must be uncommon.",Virus_Diseases
"Infection in utero: US findings in 19 cases. The results of antenatal sonographic studies of 19 fetuses with congenital infections were retrospectively reviewed by the authors. Recognizing the significance of these antenatal sonographic findings is important because in utero infections can have devastating effects on the developing fetus. An infectious viral agent was isolated in laboratory tests at birth in 11 patients, and the effects of a viral agent were proved clinically in eight. Antenatal sonography demonstrated abnormalities in 18 fetuses: Multiple organ systems were affected in 47%; intracranial abnormalities, cardiac abnormalities, and parenchymal calcifications occurred in 42%, 37%, and 32%, respectively; large placentas were seen in 32%; and the volume of amniotic fluid was decreased in 37% and increased in 37%. Sixty-three percent of fetuses were either aborted or died at birth; the 37% that lived were all developmentally impaired. On the basis of these sonographic, laboratory, and clinical findings, the authors conclude that when multiple organ system abnormalities are found at antenatal ultrasound, the presence of an in utero infection should be considered. The parents should be informed that there is a poor prognosis for any fetus demonstrating such abnormalities.",Virus_Diseases

"Group-specific serum antibody responses in children with primary and recurrent respiratory syncytial virus infections. Antigenic group-specific serum antibody responses to first and second respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections were studied in children who had been followed longitudinally from early infancy in a research day-care center. Plaque-reduction neutralizing (PRN) antibody assays and ELISAs for the fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins were done using antigens of prototype RSV strains from groups A and B. Responses to antigens of viruses homologous and heterologous to the antigenic group of the infecting viral strain were compared. Primary group A infection elicited antibodies cross-reactive with group B virus in the PRNB and the ELISAS for GB and FB. In contrast, primary group B infection induced significant increases in mean concentrations of antibody cross-reactive with group A virus only in the FA ELISA. Second RSV infections caused by group B viruses in children with histories of primary group A infection induced heterologous rises in the PRNA and GA assays, suggesting that prior group A infection had primed for a more extensive cross-reacting antibody response at the time of second RSV infections with group B viruses.",Virus_Diseases

Significant reductions in prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, and leukotriene C4 produced by stimulated monocytes were seen after 12 weeks of GLA supplementation. The antiinflammatory effects of GLA administration observed in animal models, and the apparent clinical improvement experienced by 6 or 7 rheumatoid arthritis patients given borage seed oil in this open, uncontrolled study may be due in part to reduced generation of arachidonic acid oxygenation products.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Omenn's syndrome and related combined immunodeficiency syndromes: diagnostic considerations in infants with persistent erythroderma and failure to thrive. A 4-month-old male infant had a 2-month history of an exfoliative erythroderma and alopecia. Recurrent mucosal infections, diffuse lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphocytosis and eosinophilia, anemia, and failure to thrive later developed. Investigation revealed a combined immunodeficiency with T cells of an unusual phenotype in his peripheral blood, skin, and lymph nodes. Our patient's clinical manifestations most closely resemble Omenn's syndrome, a rare form of autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Rheumatoid disease resembling lung neoplasia. We describe a 67-year-old man with severe rheumatoid arthritis of long duration. He developed a peculiar extraarticular rheumatoid complication consisting of localized lung consolidation with a pathological costal fracture, together with an abrupt systemic reaction that occurred in the course of immunosuppressive treatment. The diagnosis first proposed was lung cancer with costal metastases. However exhaustive studies performed in the search of malignancy were systematically negative and pathologic studies finally demonstrated bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) as responsible for parenchymal lung consolidation with a rheumatoid nodule eroding bone at the level of the rib fracture. These findings, after long followup of the patient, attest to the rheumatoid origin of his bizarre manifestations and definitely rule out a neoplastic etiology.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Indirect revascularization of the lower extremity by means of microvascular free-muscle flap--a preliminary report. We describe the treatment of a patient with end-stage peripheral vascular disease and ischemic ulceration of the lower extremity in whom an obliteration of the distal arterial bed precluded conventional arterial reconstruction. A nonhealing dorsal foot ulcer was debrided, and soft tissue reconstruction was accomplished by the free microsurgical transfer of a muscle flap to the distal lower extremity. Arterial inflow to this free flap was provided by a contralateral reversed saphenous vein graft from the proximal arterial tree of the leg. This procedure resulted in a healed wound, stable coverage, and limb salvage. The patient also noted complete relief of rest pain and improvement in his claudication symptoms. A follow-up arteriogram was done 2 months after surgery. Contrast injection directly into the artery of this flap showed new blood vessel growth from the muscle flap into the foot with anastomoses of these ""new vessels"" to the patient's native circulation. This experience suggests that limb salvage may be possible by the free microvascular transplantation of a muscle flap onto the limb in selected patients whose limbs are deemed ""nonreconstructible."".",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evidence for impaired erythropoietin response to anaemia in rheumatoid disease. In this study we determined the serum erythropoietin (Epo) levels of 97 anaemic rheumatoid (RD) patients (Hb less than 11 g/dl) of whom 44 had serum ferritin greater than 60 micrograms/l (anaemia of chronic disorders; ACD), 26 had ferritin 20-60 micrograms/l and 27 had ferritin less than 20 micrograms/l. These results were compared with the Epo levels of 36 iron deficient controls (Hb less than 11 g/dl), 33 non-anaemic RD patients and 33 normals. The serum Epo levels of anaemic subjects were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than those of non-anaemic patients. Despite similar Hb, the Epo results (geometric mean (confidence limits] of the ACD group (38 (32,45) mU/ml) and of RD patients with ferritin of 20-60 micrograms/l (39 (33,46)mU/ml) were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than those of iron deficient controls (65 (52,80)mU/ml). When the Hb fell to 10 g/dl or less, the serum Epo of 13 RD patients with ferritin less than 20 micrograms/l was 65 (47,89)mU/ml, significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than that of 17 iron deficient controls (104 (78,136)mU/ml).

"Cervical esophageal motility: evaluation with US in progressive systemic sclerosis. High-resolution ultrasound (US) showed that initial peristalsis propelled ingested soda smoothly and rapidly in 20 volunteers without symptoms who met both manometric and radionuclide esophageal scintigraphic (RES) criteria for normal motility. Twenty-eight patients with progressive systemic sclerosis were classified according to results of RES as follows: group 1, normal esophageal motility (three patients [11%]); group 2, hypomotility of the esophagus, excluding the cervical esophagus (18 patients [64%]); and group 3, hypomotility of the cervical esophagus (seven patients [25%]). In the seven patients of group 3, US demonstrated that an incomplete peristalsis sequence or a feeble peristalsis propelled the soda in a slow and/or to-and-fro motion with low velocities. In the other 21 patients (75%), the soda passed through the esophagus smoothly and rapidly. Retention of soda in the cervical esophagus was not limited to patients with hypomotility of the cervical esophagus. It is concluded that US is useful in evaluation of cervical esophageal motility.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Response to treatment with the leukocyte-derived immunomodulator IMREG-1 in immunocompromised patients with AIDS-related complex. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine if a 6-month course of therapy with IMREG-1, a leukocyte-derived immunomodulator, slows disease progression in patients with AIDS-related complex. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind trial. SETTING: Five academic- and three community-based clinics. PATIENTS: Immunocompromised patients (143) with HIV. INTERVENTIONS: IMREG-1 or placebo every 2 weeks (13 doses). MAIN RESULTS: Twelve of forty-eight patients on placebo and 5 of 95 patients on IMREG-1 experienced adverse events (AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or neoplasm, wasting syndrome, HIV-associated encephalopathy, or peripheral sensory neuropathy). Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, Kaplan-Meier event probabilities were 26% for the placebo group and 6% for the IMREG-1 group (P less than 0.001); based on the Cox proportional hazards model, the relative risk for patients on placebo compared with patients on IMREG-1 was 5.1 (95% CI, 1.8 to 14.8). The frequency of symptoms significantly increased from baseline in patients receiving placebo. The mean decrease in CD4+ cells from baseline was 80 x 10(6) cells/L in the placebo group and 29 x 10(6) cells/L in patients on IMREG-1, with 20% (8) and 38% (32) of patients, respectively, showing a trend toward an increase (P = 0.04). In patients receiving IMREG-1, the size and rate of delayed hypersensitivity responses were larger than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIDS-related complex experienced fewer adverse events and constitutional symptoms after IMREG-1 treatment. The slower loss of CD4+ cells and increased size and rate of delayed hypersensitivity responses most likely reflect the effect of IMREG-1 on the immune system. No toxicity related to IMREG-1 administration was observed.",Virus_Diseases
"No effect of misoprostol on renal function of rheumatoid patients treated with diclofenac. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reversibly decrease renal function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To test whether orally administered prostaglandins could mitigate this decrease, we studied the effect of misoprostol in 24 RA patients during treatment with diclofenac in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial. At baseline, 21 patients had a creatinine clearance below 80 ml/min/1.73 m2. The two treatment phases (with either misoprostol, 600 micrograms daily, or matching placebo tablets) were separated by a washout phase in which diclofenac (150 mg daily) was continued. After treatment with misoprostol/diclofenac the glomerular filtration rate was 72 +/- 5 ml/min (mean +/- standard error), and the effective renal plasma flow was 295 +/- 21 ml/min. After treatment with placebo/diclofenac, the corresponding values were 71 +/- 5 ml/min and 296 +/- 21 ml/min, respectively. We concluded that misoprostol has no effect on the renal function of RA patients treated with diclofenac.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Revised clinical and laboratory criteria for subtypes of inherited epidermolysis bullosa. A consensus report by the Subcommittee on Diagnosis and Classification of the National Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry. Inherited epidermolysis bullosa encompasses a number of diseases, with the common finding of blister formation after minor mechanical trauma to the skin. In some forms significant, if not eventually fatal, extracutaneous disease activity may occur. In recent years application of newer technologies has contributed substantially to an overall understanding of this collection of inherited diseases. Concurrently, many new phenotypes have been recognized, in part the result of ongoing prospective patient registries in the United States and abroad. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a massive literature that may appear to be confounded by seemingly excessive or arbitrary subdivision of epidermolysis bullosa variants. With these concerns in mind a subcommittee was established by the National Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry to summarize the current literature and to make recommendations as to the best clinical and laboratory criteria for the practical diagnosis and subclassification of patients with inherited epidermolysis bullosa.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Dysplastic nevi as risk markers of sporadic (nonfamilial) melanoma. A case-control study. The melanoma risk associated with dysplastic nevi outside the context of familial melanoma was studied by the case-control method.

The prevalence of dysplastic nevi was 41 (39%) of 105 in the cases and 13 (7%) of 181 in the controls. The odds ratio for dysplastic nevi by multiple logistic regression analysis simultaneously correcting for age, sex, eye color, hair color, actinic damage, freckles, and total number of nondysplastic nevi was 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.7, 16.9).

"Eosinophil cationic protein in sera of patients with atopic dermatitis. Patients with atopic dermatitis frequently show elevated blood eosinophil counts, and eosinophil-derived major basic protein has been demonstrated in the eczematous skin from patients with atopic dermatitis. To evaluate further the role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, the concentration of eosinophil cationic protein was measured in serum samples of 42 patients with moderate to severe disease. The results were compared with those obtained in 32 patients with psoriasis with (n = 9) or without (n = 23) a history of inhalant allergy, 12 patients with a history of pseudoallergic reactions to acetylsalicylic acid, 14 patients with a history of inhalant allergy, and 31 nonatopic healthy control subjects. Eosinophil cationic protein levels were significantly increased in the serum of patients with atopic dermatitis (p less than or equal to 0.005) and patients with a history of pseudoallergic reactions to acetylsalicylic acid (p less than or equal to 0.01). There was no significant difference between eosinophil cationic protein levels in patients with psoriasis or a history of inhalant allergy and in control subjects. Moreover, eosinophil cationic protein levels did not differ significantly in psoriasis patients with or without inhalant allergy. These studies support the concept of an active participation of eosinophils in atopic dermatitis and point to a possible role for eosinophils in pseudoallergy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Dietary intake in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), patients with AIDS-related complex, and serologically positive human immunodeficiency virus patients: correlations with nutritional status. One of the major clinical manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC) is the development of cachexia. This most likely results from a multifactorial interplay of poor diet, malabsorption, and altered metabolism. To assess the potential role of nutrient intake in the development or persistence of malnutrition, a detailed analysis was performed of a 72-hr diet record in clinically stable patients with AIDS (N = 18), ARC (N = 12) and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive controls without significant manifestations of disease (N = 13). Total calorie intake was 39.1 +/- 13.2 kcal/kg/day in AIDS patients vs 34.6 +/- 7.8 kcal/kg/day in ARC patients or 31.9 +/- 17.7 kcal/kg/day in HIV seropositive cases (all p = NS). Likewise, mean protein intakes were similar among the groups and exceeded recommended daily dietary allowance (RDA) guidelines. The mean body weight changes from the inception of illness were -11 +/- 1% in AIDS, -6 +/- 7% in ARC, vs +3 +/- 2% in HIV-seropositive-only cases (p less than 0.05 vs AIDS and ARC). Dietary vitamin and mineral analysis revealed that 88% of AIDS, 88% of HIV seropositive, and 89% of ARC patients were ingesting less than 50% RDA for at least one nutrient. The mean number of deficiencies per patient was 1.8 +/- 1.3 in AIDS, 3.8 +/- 3.5 in ARC, and 2.9 +/- 2.5 in HIV-seropositive-only cases (p less than 0.05 AIDS vs ARC). There were no significant correlations between specific anthropometric measurements and dietary intakes of protein or fat.",Virus_Diseases
"Prevalence of maternal HIV infection in Scotland based on unlinked anonymous testing of newborn babies. Dried blood spot samples from newborn babies have been successfully tested for HIV-1 antibody by the particle agglutination method to assess the prevalence of infection in the mothers. In January, 1990, unlinked anonymous testing of Guthrie cards for HIV antibody was begun in Scotland. 99.6% of Scottish births were tested. 9 mothers spontaneously refused to allow testing of their baby's blood. Samples were coded by district postcodes. Eluates of 65,773 dried blood spots were initially tested for HIV-1 antibody with the Fujirebio technique. Of the 31 positive samples 19 were confirmed to be positive by enzyme-linked radioimmunoassay and western blot (seroprevalence 0.29 per 1000). All these samples came from large metropolitan areas on the east coast. Prevalences were 2.5 per 1000 for Edinburgh city, 1.4 per 1000 for Dundee, and 0.7 per 1000 for Aberdeen. We identified as HIV-positive all babies known to be so in named testing programmes. HIV testing of Guthrie cards can be used to monitor HIV status in mothers who have just given birth. The use of district postcode data in sample identification will allow accurate targetting of prevention strategies and early detection of spread of infection by geographic area.",Virus_Diseases
"Evidence for autoimmunity in the tight skin mouse model of systemic sclerosis. The tight skin mouse strain has been proposed for use as an animal model of systemic sclerosis because this animal exhibits a condition that has biochemical and pathologic similarities to the human disease. To date, however, evidence of inflammatory and immunologic changes in the tight skin mouse has been scarce. We demonstrated the presence of antinuclear antibodies in approximately half of these mice ages 8 months and older. This suggests that there is an autoimmune component in their disease process. The antibodies were identified as anti-topoisomerase I by a characteristic staining pattern on HEp-2 cells and by Western blot analysis. Except for a low incidence of anti-DNA antibodies, none of the other parameters tested, including mitogen responses, lymphokine production, and anti-erythrocyte antibodies, was indicative of immune system dysregulation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection in the cat as a model for HIV infection in man: FIV-induced impairment of immune function. To assess the value of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection as a model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in man, we studied the impairment of certain immunological functions following natural or experimental FIV infection. Proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from symptomatic and asymptomatic cats after naturally or experimentally acquired FIV infection, induced by activation with the mitogens concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, or lipopolysaccharide or by stimulation with human interleukin-2 (IL-2), were significantly lower than the proliferative responses found with PBMC from noninfected control cats. Also IL-2 production levels of mitogen-activated PBMC from naturally infected symptomatic cats were significantly reduced. These data confirm that the pathogenesis of FIV infection in the cat, like HIV infection in man, is characterized by a serious malfunction of the immune system.",Virus_Diseases

"Zidovudine resistance predicted by direct detection of mutations in DNA from HIV-infected lymphocytes. Zidovudine-resistant strains of HIV have recently been isolated from individuals during prolonged treatment. Analysis of the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) gene from clinical isolates revealed that resistance was due to multiple nucleotide changes conferring specific amino acid substitutions in this enzyme. In order to correlate the degree of resistance with these amino acid changes, we constructed a series of infectious HIV variants with specific combinations of mutations in the RT gene and assessed their sensitivity to zidovudine. The reproducible nature of the mutations seen in clinical isolates has enabled the polymerase chain reaction to be used to identify lesions associated with resistance. This procedure was validated by analysis of sensitive and resistant clinical isolates with RT genes of known DNA sequence. Using a 'double' amplification procedure, zidovudine sensitivity was assessed by direct detection of specific mutations in DNA from peripheral-blood lymphocyte samples. This should make it possible to test large numbers of individuals receiving zidovudine therapy, with the aim of establishing the clinical significance of the resistant isolates.",Virus_Diseases
"Preparation and characterization of an intravenous solution of IgG from human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive donors. An intravenous solution of 99% pure globulin (hyperimmune IgG, HIVIG) was obtained from pooled plasma of selected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-seropositive asymptomatic donors with greater than 400 CD4+/microliters cells per microliter and a high titer of antibody to HIV-1 p24 protein. HIVIG had high titers of antibody to p24, glycoprotein 41 (gp41), and gp120, group-specific neutralizing activity, and binding to the gp120 hypervariable loop region. It inhibited syncytia formation. At low concentration, it enhanced viral production of HIV-1 in infected peripheral blood monocytes but was inhibitory at higher concentration. HIVIG directed group-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against HIV-infected targets. For a period of 6 to 28 months, plasma donors kept stable antibody titers and had a 1.0% decrease in CD4+ cells per month. One gram per kilogram HIVIG injected in two juvenile chimpanzees was well tolerated and did not transmit HIV, as measured by negative cell culture, IgM immune response to HIV proteins, and polymerase chain reaction. The mean half-life of HIV-1 p24 antibody was 15 days. These preliminary data suggest that HIVIG is a safe product suitable for clinical trial in HIV-1-infected individuals.",Virus_Diseases
"Benefits and costs of HIV testing. The benefits and costs of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in employment settings are examined from two points of view: that of private employers whose profitability may be affected by their testing policies and that of public policy-makers who may affect social welfare through their design of regulations related to HIV testing. The results reveal that HIV testing is clearly not cost-beneficial for most firms, although the benefits of HIV testing may outweigh the costs for some large firms that offer generous fringe-benefit packages and that recruit workers from populations in which the prevalence of HIV infection is high. The analysis also indicates that the testing decisions of unregulated employers are not likely to yield socially optimal economic outcomes and that existing state and federal legislation related to HIV testing in employment settings has been motivated primarily by concerns over social equity.",Virus_Diseases

Between 8 and 11 months post-RT she had severe breast fibrosis, retraction, and pain that required a mastectomy for relief. The patient with scleroderma received 5040 cGy at 180 cGy per day without a boost. Between 1 and 4 months post-RT the systemic symptoms of scleroderma progressed and the breast became hard and retracted. Both rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are chronic systemic diseases characterized by severe inflammation and an autoimmune component. The presence of scleroderma at or before treatment should be considered a contraindication to breast RT, whereas the presence of active rheumatoid arthritis should be considered a relative contraindication.

"The evolution of lymphadenopathy and hypergammaglobulinemia are evidence for early and sustained polyclonal B lymphocyte activation during human immunodeficiency virus infection. To examine whether polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes as measured by hypergammaglobulinemia contributes to lymphadenopathy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, correlates of adenopathy were examined in 240 homosexual men. Lymph node size was measured in 12 sites semiannually over 4 years. Both adenopathy and hyperglobulinemia developed within 1 year after seroconversion and persisted at high levels. Adenopathy declined near diagnosis of AIDS whereas serum IgG decreased 8-16 months after diagnosis. Adenopathy attributable to HIV occurred in all palpable node groups. By logistic regression, HIV-positive men were best discriminated from HIV-negative men by size of posterior cervical nodes and the number of sites with enlarged nodes. In a repeated measures model of covariance, adenopathy in HIV-positive men was associated with more CD4+ cells (P less than .002), elevated serum globulins (P less than .01), and lower platelet counts (P less than .05). Adenopathy declined over time (P less than .001) and with diagnosis of AIDS or AIDS-related complex (P less than .03). Thus, adenopathy and hypergammaglobulinemia are correlated and follow a similar course through various stages of HIV infection, suggesting that both are caused by polyclonal B cell activation.",Virus_Diseases
"Neuromuscular function in polio survivors at one-year follow-up [published erratum appears in Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1991 Mar;72(3):213]  Many polio survivors complain of progressive loss of strength, work capacity, endurance, and ability to recover from fatiguing activity. These variables were measured initially and one year later in the quadriceps muscles of 28 symptomatic and 16 asymptomatic persons who had polio and 38 control individuals. Peak knee extension torque was measured isokinetically and isometrically. Endurance, or the amount of time the subject could maintain isometric torque at 40% of maximal torque, was measured. Work capacity was determined as the product of isometric torque and endurance time. Recovery of strength was measured at regular intervals for ten minutes after the endurance test. Statistical analysis was done by repeated measures ANOVA. Although the initial measures showed significant deficits in mean peak torque, work capacity, and recovery of strength in symptomatic postpolio subjects, no significant changes were found one year later in any of the variables. We conclude that symptomatic postpolio subjects do not lose significant neuromuscular function in one year.",Virus_Diseases

Adverse reactions to the preschool (fifth) dose of adsorbed diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine in Canadian children. OBJECTIVE: To quantify accurately the rate of adverse reactions after the preschool (fifth) dose of adsorbed diphtheria toxoid-pertussis vaccine-tetanus toxoid (DPT) vaccine and to test the hypothesis that large local reactions are attributable to the diphtheria toxoid. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Suburban community public health unit. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy children 4 to 5 years of age with a history of having received four doses of adsorbed DPT vaccine. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were given either the standard DPT vaccine (with 25 Lf units of diphtheria toxoid) or a modified DPT vaccine (with 10 Lf units of diphtheria toxoid). They were assessed 24 hours later by a nurse. Serum samples obtained before vaccination were tested for diphtheria and tetanus antitoxin levels by means of neutralization assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of large local reactions (an area of redness or swelling or both of 5 cm or greater) 24 hours after vaccination in the two groups. Relation between serum antitoxin levels before vaccination and the rate of large local reactions in each group. RESULTS: Of the 250 subjects enrolled 124 received the standard vaccine and 126 the modified one. Large local reactions occurred in 71% of the subjects receiving the standard vaccine and 52% of those receiving the modified one (p less than 0.01). In the former group large erythematous reactions occurred significantly more often in those with an elevated prevaccination diphtheria antitoxin level than in those without an elevated level; no relation was found between such reactions and the prevaccination tetanus antitoxin level. Reduced arm movement was evident in 45% of the children in the two groups. Few had systemic adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Large local reactions occur frequently after the preschool administration of the DPT vaccine. These reactions are uncomfortable but not serious. They result in part from the large amount of diphtheria toxoid in the standard DPT vaccine.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

SETTING: Outpatient endocrinology clinic. PATIENTS: One hundred nine consecutive women prescribed 75 to 100 mg/d spironolactone for at least 4 months in whom adequate follow-up data were available. RESULTS: Hirsutism improved in 72% of the women. Women with regular menses, whether or not they used oral contraceptives (OCs), had the highest response rate to spironolactone (78%), whereas women with irregular menses who did not use an OC had the lowest response rate (55%). Favorable responses were associated with increased severity of hirsutism (P = 0.04) and lower serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (P = 0.05). Responders and nonresponders did not differ significantly in age (P = 0.10), duration of hirsutism (P = 0.14), pretreatment serum testosterone (T) (P = 0.48), or body mass index (P = 0.11). However, when each parameter was divided into subsets, trends toward decreasing response were observed with increasing age, duration of hirsutism over 15 years, and increasing serum T level. CONCLUSION: Low-dose spironolactone improves hirsutism in a majority of hirsute women, irrespective of age, severity or duration of hirsutism, menstrual status, or serum hormone levels.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Relation between humoral responses to HIV gag and env proteins at seroconversion and clinical outcome of HIV infection. OBJECTIVE--To study the contribution of the humoral response to HIV-I at seroconversion to disease outcome after 84 months. DESIGN--A retrospective longitudinal study. SETTING--Two haemophilia centres in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS--88 Haemophiliac patients infected with HIV-I for whom sera were available from before seroconversion and in whom clinical follow up data were available. RESULTS--Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significant difference between a high titre (greater than 1600) p24 antibody response at seroconversion and prolonged time before the development of HIV related disease (p = 0.0008). In contrast, higher titres of antibody to gp120 at seroconversion (greater than 25,600) correlated with more rapid clinical deterioration (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS--The first humoral response to HIV proteins at seroconversion is associated with clinical outcome; patients with an initial low titre antibody response to the gagp24 protein have a significantly faster rate of progression to CDC stage IV disease. Patients with a high titre p24 antibody response progress to AIDS more slowly, and these data provide an explanation why p24 antigenaemia is not universally detected in patients with AIDS. It is unclear whether the association between a strong initial p24 antibody response and slower progression of HIV disease is causal and if so whether it is due to viral or host factors.",Virus_Diseases
"CO2 laser for suppurative hidradenitis of the vulva. Chronic suppurative hidradenitis is a disease of the apocrine glands occurring predominantly in the axillae of the anogenital region. Treatment, to date, has been frustrating. Prolonged antibiotic therapy and multiple incisions and drainage have been the usual form of therapy, but those surgical procedures leave patients with ugly scars; retracted, hypertrophic skin edges; and pitted, indurated and disfiguring abscesses. The only successful treatment to date has been wide excision of the entire apocrine gland-bearing tissues, such as radical vulvectomy, which often necessitates grafts to cover the surgically exposed areas. That has left patients with unsatisfactorily functioning vaginas and a mutilated appearance. Recently we instituted the use of the CO2 laser to treat these patients with the goal of eradicating the suppurative sinus tracts and the infected apocrine glands without removing large volumes of adjacent, unaffected tissue. Over the past eight years we treated 11 patients who had extensive, chronic hidradenitis of the anogenital area with the CO2 laser. The use of laser therapy for these patients has produced effective and less-mutilating results. Such treatment has been a successful option for treating this debilitating disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis by nested polymerase chain reaction assay of cerebrospinal fluid. With the aim of improving early diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with two ""nested"" primer pairs was developed for the amplification of herpes simplex virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Southern blotting was used to confirm the specificity of the amplification. The assay was applied to 151 CSF samples from 43 consecutive patients with herpes simplex encephalitis verified by the finding of herpes simplex virus/viral antigen in a brain biopsy sample or at necropsy (13) and/or intrathecal production of IgG antibody to the virus (40). As controls, 87 CSF samples from 60 patients with acute febrile focal encephalopathy (initially suspected to be herpes simplex encephalitis but excluded by the absence of intrathecal antibody synthesis) were tested. PCR detected herpes simplex virus DNA in 42 of the 43 patients with proven herpes simplex encephalitis; all but 1 were positive in the first CSF sample taken. The 1 PCR-negative patient had been treated with acyclovir from 20 h after the onset of symptoms. All the control subjects were PCR negative, as were 270 internal contamination controls. The PCR result remained positive in samples drawn up to 27 days after the onset of neurological symptoms. This method is a rapid and non-invasive means to diagnose herpes simplex encephalitis; it is highly sensitive and specific.",Virus_Diseases
"Reliability of pain scales in the assessment of literate and illiterate patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The assessment of a measure of chronic pain, should be reliable, valid and sensitive to change. Our study evaluated the reliability of 3 pain scales, visual analogue scale (VAS), numerical rating scale (NRS) and verbal rating scale (VRS) in literate and illiterate patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with RA attending an outpatient rheumatology clinic were interviewed and asked to score their pain levels on the 3 pain scales. The scales were presented in random order, twice, before and just after a regular medical consultation. Ninety-one patients were studied (25 illiterate and 66 literate). The Pearson product moment correlation between first and second assessment was 0.937 for VAS, 0.963 for NRS and 0.901 for VRS in the literate patient group and 0.712 for VAS, 0.947 for NRS and 0.820 for VRS in the illiterate patient group.

"A 12-month treatment of severe psoriasis with acitretin: results of a Canadian open multicenter study. Both etretinate and its principal metabolite, acitretin, are efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis. Because patients with severe psoriasis often require chronic therapy, this study was undertaken to determine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of acitretin in patients on continuous treatment for 12 months. The initial daily dose of 50 mg was taken for 4 weeks. Thereafter the dose was increased or decreased by 10 mg at monthly intervals (10 to 70 mg) to produce the optimal response with minimal toxicity. Seventy percent of the patients who completed 12 months of treatment showed marked improvement. All patients experienced adverse reactions; dry lips, hair loss, skin peeling, pruritus, and nail disorders were the most frequent. Fourteen patients were withdrawn from the study because of one or more intolerable adverse reactions.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Lung function in school-age children who had mild lower respiratory illnesses in early childhood. We examined the relationship between patterns of mild lower respiratory illness (LRI) experienced in early childhood and lung function in 89 boys and 70 girls 6 to 18 yr of age. The children's histories of outpatient visits for wheezing and nonwheezing LRI during the first 6 yr of life had been documented by physicians in a single pediatric practice. Most children were reported by their parents to have been free of recurrent respiratory symptoms during the 2 yr prior to lung function testing. In sex-specific analyses, average lung function assessed by spirometry was similar in children who had made zero or one physician visit for wheezing LRI during the preschool years. Boys who had experienced two or more episodes of wheezing LRI during the preschool years had lower average FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75, Vmax50, and Vmax75 than did boys who had zero or one preschool wheezing illness. The association between recurrent preschool wheezing LRI and later lung function remained after exclusion of data from seven boys who were reported to have wheezed in the 2 yr prior to study. Girls who had experienced two or more preschool wheezing LRI had lower average FEF25-75 and Vmax50 than girls with a history of zero or one such illness, but differences were not statistically significant. Recurrent nonwheezing LRI during the preschool years was not significantly associated with subsequent lung function in either sex, regardless of preschool wheezing LRI history. Detailed information concerning early childhood LRI experience is valuable in epidemiologic studies of factors influencing lung function in children.",Virus_Diseases

"Common foot problems. Relieving the pain of bunions, keratoses, corns, and calluses. Many of the painful foot problems seen in adults are easily treated. Bunions and bunionettes often respond to a change to wide, soft-toed shoes or sandals and the temporary use of a mild anti-inflammatory agent. Initial treatment of plantar keratoses is trimming and use of cushioning shoe inserts. Diffuse keratoses may require reconstructive surgery if metatarsal deformity is the cause. Seed corns and soft corns respond to trimming, and alleviation of pressure with padding and wearing of open-toed shoes is beneficial in these lesions as well as in hard corns. Surgical resection of any underlying exostosis may be required for hard or soft corns or ""pump bumps,"" which are caused by pressure from the shoe's heel. In all cases, patients should be advised to change to shoes that provide plenty of room in the toe box and that minimize friction on painful areas.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Clinical correlations with serum C1q levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Previous studies have suggested that serum C1q levels measured during the first 5 years of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be predictive of the extent of subsequent joint damage. To further evaluate the clinical significance of this marker in RA, levels of C1q were measured by radial immunodiffusion in serum samples from 107 well-characterized patients with RA. Mean levels of C1q were higher in patients with a disease duration less than or equal to 5 years (173 micrograms/ml) than in patients with a disease duration greater than 5 years (148 micrograms/ml) (P = 0.032). Serum C1q levels were correlated with total joint counts and activities of daily living scores, but no correlation was observed with erythrocyte sedimentation rates or with radiographic scores.

"Presence of immunoreactive endothelin in synovial fluid: analysis of 22 cases. The endothelins are a family of recently defined active peptides with a wide range of activities, including the activation of the synthesis of prostaglandins.

Endothelin-like immunoreactivity was detectable in all SF samples and the mean concentration of endothelin was 2.6 +/- 0.3 pg/ml, more than twice that in normal human plasma. The mean level of endothelin in SF in rheumatoid arthritis was 2.5 +/- 0.4 pg/ml (n = 11), and was not statistically different from either osteoarthritis, 3.0 +/- 0.5 pg/ml (n = 7), or acute inflammatory arthritis, 2.0 +/- 0.4 pg/ml (n = 4).

"Characterization of cutaneous infiltrates in MRL/lpr mice monitored from onset to the full development of lupus erythematosus-like skin lesions. The skin is a primary site injured in lupus erythematosus (LE), but it is still controversial whether the injury is due to cells of the mononuclear infiltrate and which immunocompetent cells play the major role in the development of cutaneous LE. To better characterize the role of immunocompetent cells, we performed an immunohistochemical examination of these cells in LE-like skin lesions in MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice. Skin lesions in 60 female MRL/lpr mice were monitored from onset to full development. Skin specimens from each stage were stained for epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (Ia(+)-LC), for Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells (Thy-1+DEC), and for the phenotype of the mononuclear cell infiltrates. The numbers of Ia(+)-LC and Thy-1+DEC were decreased markedly in the skin lesions at the later stage. However, the numbers of Ia(+)-LC were increased significantly in the central portion of lesions at an early stage and in the peripheral portion of lesions later. L3T4+ cells were predominant, and the L3T4/Lyt-2 ratio was high in dermal infiltrates at an early stage. With advancing stage, the L3T4/Lyt-2 ratio gradually decreased in dermal infiltrates, whereas the Thy-1.2/Lyt-2 ratio in lymph nodes was reversed. L3T4+ cells were especially predominant in dermal infiltrates under the epidermis with increased numbers of Ia(+)-LC. This immunohistochemical analysis of a mouse model of cutaneous LE revealed changes in immunocompetent cell populations with the evolution of skin lesions, and we conclude that Ia(+)-LC and Thy-1+DEC, as well as L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells, may play pathogenic roles in the development of skin lesions.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Fc epsilon receptor II/CD23 positive lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis: II. Infiltration of Fc epsilon R II(+) T cells in the skin lesion. Cells expressing Fc receptors for IgE (Fc epsilon R II) were identified in skin from patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), eczematous dermatitis (ED), and in skin from normal nonatopic subjects, with the use of monoclonal antibodies to human lymphocyte Fc epsilon R II, H107, and to lymphoid cell-surface antigens by double immunofluorescence staining. Two to four percent of infiltrating mononuclear cells expressed Fc epsilon R II, and more than half of these cells were T epsilon cells in both acute and chronic AD lesions. Fc epsilon R II(+) T cells (T epsilon cells) bearing CD8 infiltrated preferentially acute lesions, whereas chronic lesions contained either CD8(+) or CD4(+) T epsilon cells, or both. Fc epsilon R II(+) cells rarely were present in ED lesions. There was no significant correlation between % Fc epsilon R II(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the proportion of lesional Fc epsilon R II(+) cells, extent of skin lesions, or serum IgE levels, implying the selective accumulation of Fc epsilon R II(+) cells in the inflammatory infiltrate of AD. These observations suggest that the increased generation of Fc epsilon R II(+) cells in skin lesions, including CD8 (+) T epsilon cells, is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in systemic sclerosis and primary pulmonary hypertension. Reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance by a high inspired oxygen concentration is a common, but not universal phenomenon in patients with pulmonary vascular disease of varying etiology that may determine their response to long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy. We therefore determined changes in PVR during oxygen therapy in two patient populations not previously studied: systemic sclerosis (n = 8, mean age +/- SEM, 44.5 +/- 5.4 years) and primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 7, mean age +/- SEM 38 +/- 7.8 years). All patients were hypoxemic (arterial oxygen tension, on air 9.5 +/- 1.2 kPa for SSc and 8.3 +/- 0.6 kPa for PPH, p greater than 0.05). Right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, systemic arterial pressure, PaO2 and cardiac output by thermodilution were measured at three, 20-min intervals while inspiring air and again after inspiring 60 percent oxygen for 30 min. The PVR fell significantly with oxygen in patients with SSc from 797.6 +/- 179.2 to 610 +/- 151.6 dynes/s/cm-5 (p less than 0.01), and this fall correlated with baseline PAP and PaO2 prior to oxygen therapy (r = 0.86, p less than 0.025; r = 0.77, p less than 0.05, respectively). In patients with PPH, there was no significant fall in PVR with oxygen (from 969 +/- 80.2 to 851.9 +/- 91.2 dynes/s/cm-5, p greater than 0.05) and no predictor of a vasodilator response in individual patients. In SSc, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction contributes more consistently to elevated PVR than in patients with PPH.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Papular mucinosis in L-tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Five patients with the L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome had a generalized eruption of flesh-colored papules. In all patients, histologic examination revealed a focal accumulation of mucin in the upper mid dermis, associated with increased dermal cellularity. The mucin was composed predominantly of hyaluronic acid, with small amounts of sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. The cells within the lesion were fibroblasts. The lesions slowly regressed after L-tryptophan was discontinued. Proposed explanations for the L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome have centered on contaminants, chemically related to L-tryptophan, introduced in the manufacturing process.

The predominant sites of immunoreactivity were the specific intracytoplasmic granules of the mast cells. All mast cell subtypes--that is, normal and reactive mast cells, such as those in lymph nodes exhibiting chronic non-specific lymphadenitis, and malignant or neoplastic mast cells in various types of mastocytosis--reacted with this antibody. This finding is of diagnostic importance, because mast cell proliferation could be mistaken for histiocyte proliferation.

"Simultaneous assessment of inflammation and epidermal proliferation in psoriatic plaques during long-term treatment with the vitamin D3 analogue MC903: modulations and interrelations. The influence of topical application of MC903, an analogue of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, on psoriatic plaques was investigated during a long-term treatment study. The parameters for epidermal growth and for inflammation were assessed on frozen sections using immunohistochemical methods to elucidate their modulations in time and the interrelations between the different cell types involved during treatment with MC903. Biopsies were taken before and after 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. Monoclonal antibodies against the hyperproliferation-associated keratin 16, against cycling nuclei, and against T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Langerhans cells and CD14-positive cells were used in combination with a polyclonal antibody against polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN)-elastase. The earliest change was a statistically significant decrease in PMN after 1 week of treatment followed by a decline of cycling nuclei after 2 weeks. These changes preceded a decrease of T lymphocytes which occurred after 4 weeks. Keratin 16 content tended to diminish after 4 weeks of treatment. CD14+ cells decreased slightly during the observation period, whereas Langerhans cells tended to increase. No B lymphocytes were found. These results suggest that MC903 influences the number of PMN and epidermal growth rather than the number of T lymphocytes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"L-glutamine stimulates jejunal sodium and chloride absorption in pig rotavirus enteritis. Rotavirus enteritis is the leading cause of diarrhea in infants worldwide. A research priority of the World Health Organization is to develop oral rehydration solutions containing amino acids or other additives that will stimulate intestinal absorption more efficiently than the current glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. Glutamine is the principal metabolic fuel of the small bowel and a putative stimulator of mucosal repair. This report describes the transport response to mucosal L-glutamine following intestinal injury caused by porcine rotavirus. Peak symptoms and mucosal damage were observed 2-7 days after oral rotavirus inoculation. In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to L-glutamine (30 mmol/L) and L-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Subsequent application of mucosal D-glucose (30 mmol/L) caused additional stimulation of electrogenic Na+ transport, but the response to glucose was blunted (P less than 0.05) in the infected tissues. Glutamine and alanine enhanced Na+ absorption to a similar degree (2-2.5 muEq.cm-2.h-1), but glutamine stimulated equal amounts of electrogenic and electroneutral NaCl absorption, whereas alanine had no significant effect on net Cl- flux. Glutamine is a potentially useful substrate for investigation in oral rehydration solutions for infant diarrhea.",Virus_Diseases
"Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in normal subjects during attenuated influenza virus infection. Fourteen healthy male subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers of 1:8 or less to homologous influenza A virus were studied. Six subjects received live, attenuated influenza virus by nasal drops and by aerosol. Although infection occurred in these six subjects, with the development of 4-fold or greater increases in hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers, they remained asymptomatic. Eight subjects received placebo via the same route, and did not develop symptoms and showed no increase in antibody titer. Prior to administration of virus or placebo, histamine diphosphate aerosol increased airway resistance only slightly, and there was no difference between the virus and placebo groups. Two days after inoculation, bronchomotor responses in the placebo group were unchanged (p greater than 0.05), but in the virus-infected group, bronchomotor responses were significantly greater than in the preinfected state (p less than 0.01). Isoproterenol hydrochloride reversed and prevented the increase in airway resistance after histamine, suggesting that the bronchoconstriction was caused by smooth muscle contraction. Our findings indicate that transient, asymptomatic respiratory virus infection augments airway smooth muscle responses.",Virus_Diseases

"Human immunodeficiency virus infection in the US Air Force: seroconversions, clinical staging, and assessment of a T helper cell functional assay to predict change in CD4+ T cell counts. As of January 1990, 933 persons with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection were clinically evaluated at Wilford Hall US Air Force (USAF) Medical Center. The Walter Reed HIV staging system was used in these evaluations to describe disease status and progression. Most persons were diagnosed through mandatory HIV testing in the USAF and were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.

"Rheumatoid arthritis in Israeli Jews: shared sequences in the third hypervariable region of DRB1 alleles are associated with susceptibility. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to be associated with class II HLA antigens in most populations, but recent studies in Israeli Jewish patients showed no significant differences in either DR4 or DR1 between patients and controls. In a previous DR4 subset study we found DR4-Dw15 to be associated with susceptibility (RR = 9.2) but this allele occurred in only 12% of the patients. We analyzed all DRB1 genes, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization with allele specific oligonucleotides, in 49 Jewish patients with RA and 40 normal Jewish controls. Six DRB1 alleles that are similar to the prototype DR4-Dw4 (DRB1*0401) appeared to contribute to the risk for developing RA. In addition to DR4-Dw15 (DRB1*0405) 2 other alleles having substitutions in codons 71 only (DR1-Dw1/DRB1*0101, DR4-Dw14.2/DRB1*0408) or in codons 70 and 71 (DRw10/DRB1*1001) gave highly significant relative risks. Together, this group, with valine in position 85, and glycine in codon 86, gave a relative risk of 11.0 (p = 0.0002). Two other alleles with the same sequence in the third hypervariable region (amino acids 67-74) but with valine in codon 86 (DR4-Dw14.1/DRB1*0404) or alanine in 85 and valine in 86 (DR1-Dw20, DRB1*0102) gave a combined risk of 3.6 (p = 0.049). Altogether these 7 alleles with similar sequences in the third hypervariable region accounted for 55.6% of the patients, with an overall relative risk of 8.6 (p = 0.00002). Our results in this population indicate that shared epitopes in the third hypervariable region of DRB1 alleles also play a role in susceptibility to RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The relationship between viral RNA, myelin-specific mRNAs, and demyelination in central nervous system disease during Theiler's virus infection. The DA strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (DAV) causes a chronic demyelinating disease in susceptible mouse strains. To elucidate the pathogenesis of DAV-induced demyelination, the authors investigated the spatial and chronologic relationship between virus (antigen and RNA), myelin-specific mRNAs, and demyelination in DAV-infected mice using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and slot blot hybridization analyses. In spinal cord white matter, viral RNA was detected easily in ventral root entry zones 1 to 2 weeks after infection. Viral RNA increased to maximum levels by 4 weeks after infection, which was associated with inflammation and mild demyelination. At 8 to 12 weeks after infection, when demyelination became most extensive, viral RNA was significantly decreased. Demyelination did not chronologically or spatially parallel the presence of viral RNA within the spinal cord. Decrease of myelin-specific mRNAs, including myelin-basic protein and proteolipid protein mRNAs, was observed within the demyelinating lesions with or without detectable viral RNA. These results indicate that a viral infection of white matter in the early phase of the infection initiates spinal cord disease leading to demyelination, but later an ongoing immunopathologic process contributes to the presence of extensive demyelination.",Virus_Diseases
"Enhanced expression of CD2 antigen on lung T cells. CD2 molecules not only function in the adhesion of T cells to other cell types but also in the activation of T cells via an alternative pathway. To investigate the possible roles of CD2 molecules in the activation and accumulation of lung T cells, using monoclonal antibodies and a flow cytometer we evaluated CD2 antigen expression on lung and blood lymphocytes in 10 normal subjects, 30 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, 7 patients with interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular disease, 5 patients with farmer's lung disease, and 8 patients with Crohn's disease. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD2 on lung T cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was significantly higher than that on blood T cells in all study groups except the control group. In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis this enhancement of the expression of CD2 antigen was observed only on CD4+ T cells. Since ligands for CD2 are present on immunocompetent cells of other types in the local pulmonary milieu, these results suggest that increased expression of CD2 molecules could facilitate the communication and interaction of lung T cells with their environment in the lung and thereby possibly contribute to the local accumulation of T cells.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Time course of ozone-induced neutrophilia in normal humans. Five normal human subjects were exposed for 1 h to filtered air (FA) once and to 0.3 ppm O3 on 3 separate days. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was obtained less than 1 h after FA and either less than 1, 6, or 24 h after O3 exposure. FEV1 was measured before the exposures and the BAL. The first aliquot [proximal airway (PA) sample] was analyzed separately from the pooled Aliquots 2 through 4 [distal airway and alveolar surface (DAAS) sample]. The data from the PA and DAAS samples were then combined to calculate the values that would have been obtained by pooling all BAL washes. FEV1 was significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased 1 h after O3 exposure, but it returned to preexposure values at 6 and 24 h after O3. The percent of neutrophils in the PA sample was significantly elevated at less than 1 h (3.7%) at 6 h (16.5%), and at 24 h (9.2%) after O3. The percent of neutrophils in the DAAS sample and calculated pooled values were significantly elevated at 6 h (4.1 and 7.6%) and at 24 h (5.1 and 5.8%) after O3. These data demonstrate that O3-induced symptoms, FEV1 decrements, and airway neutrophilia follow different time courses and indicate that the pooling of BAL washes may obscure the detection of an O3-induced bronchiolitis. The degree of neutrophilia in the BAL did not correlate with the sensitivity of the individual subjects when measured by acute changes in FEV1, suggesting a dichotomy of pathways that result in O3-induced airway neutrophilia and pulmonary function decrements.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Pathogenesis of onychoschizia (lamellar dystrophy). Onychoschizia or lamellar dystrophy of the nails is common, especially in adult women, but little information is available about its cause. Most theories involve environmental factors, but supportive experimental data are scarce. Therefore we studied the in vitro nail changes produced by several organic solvents, detergents, water, other polar materials, and both acidic and basic solutions. Challenged and control fingernail clippings were examined grossly, microscopically, and by scanning electron microscopy at regular intervals. There was a progressive increase in severity with prolonged wetting and drying. By 3 weeks, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated unattached individual cells in empty spaces in which separation was more prominent. Basic solutions caused some softening, but layering (peeling) was seen only after repeated hydration and dehydration. Although other factors may influence onychoschizia, the typical changes can be produced in normal nails after a 21-day challenge of repeated exposure to water followed by dehydration. These findings suggest a probable cause for the condition and a logical approach to management.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Realities in ossiculoplasty. The results of ossiculoplasty are frequently reported in terms of closure of the air-bone gap. This parameter is a reliable indicator of the degree of technical success, and is useful in comparing different materials and types of reconstructions. However, assessment of the operated ear alone does not evaluate the effect of surgery on binaural hearing ability, leading to the situation where sub-optimal advice may be given to patients pre-operatively. This article advocates a more patient orientated method of assessing the results of ossiculoplasty. Previous studies have indicated that the operated ear must reach an air conduction level of 30 dB for the speech frequencies, or be within 15 dB of the other ear, to ensure that the patient will gain significant benefit. A graphical method for the prediction of patient benefit is presented, and compared to the rule of thumb quoted above. The implications for surgeons and patients considering ossiculoplasty are obvious. Many statements routinely made to patients prior to surgery for conductive hearing loss are unduly optimistic and unrelated to the realities of reported results. There is a need to determine what types of such hearing losses can be helped surgically, and more importantly to what extent the patients hearing disability can be relieved.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Diltiazem-associated skin eruptions are a rare adverse effect; however, the incidence of rash may occur more frequently than reported in postmarketing surveillance studies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Voluntary human immunodeficiency virus testing: acceptance levels and identification of seropositive individuals. Of 4340 clients of a clinic for those with sexually transmitted diseases who were eligible for voluntary, confidential, serologic testing for the human immunodeficiency virus, 4246 (97.8%) consented to testing; 23 (0.5%) were seropositive. Of 94 persons who declined voluntary testing but who were tested in a blinded study, nine (9.6%) were seropositive. Seropositive persons who declined voluntary testing did not conceal their association with a risk group, while only 61% of seropositive individuals who accepted voluntary testing admitted to inclusion in a risk group before the test. Voluntary testing appears to be insufficient, because 28% of the seropositive individuals were not identified as being seropositive; also, there was a significant deficiency associated with identification of risk at pretest counseling among persons agreeing to voluntary testing.",Virus_Diseases

We describe a 34-year-old man from southern Florida with a history of intravenous drug use, dually infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II), who developed a myelopathy clinically indistinguishable from HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). This myelopathy was characterized by spastic lower extremity weakness, distal paresthesias, sensory loss with a discrete thoracic level to pinprick, back pain, impotence, and sphincter disturbances.

"Disseminated hypopigmented keratoses. We present two cases of asymptomatic, widespread keratotic eruptions in young female patients. Clinically, the lesions are well-demarcated, small, hypopigmented, flat-topped papules occurring on the trunk and extremities in a uniform distribution. Skin biopsy specimens from one patient revealed hyperorthokeratosis, papillomatosis, and a normal amount of melanin. We suggest that this is a newly recognized dermatologic entity that may be descriptively termed disseminated hypopigmented keratoses. Disseminated hypopigmented keratoses may be distinguished by clinical and histologic criteria from similar keratotic eruptions. Since the lesions of disseminated hypopigmented keratoses are both inconspicuous and asymptomatic, it is likely that the disorder is more prevalent than our two cases would suggest.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor type B receptors in the skin of patients with systemic sclerosis. The expression of B-type receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was investigated in skin biopsy samples from patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), by immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies specific for the receptor. Whereas skin from healthy individuals lacked expression of PDGF-B receptors, receptor expression was seen in sclerodermatous skin lesions from 13 of 14 patients. Increased receptor expression was observed in dermal vessels, as well as on many stromal fibroblast-like cells close to these vessels. PDGF-B receptor expression was most pronounced within and around dermal vessels in which perivascular infiltrates of Leu-4-positive T lymphocytes and HLA-DR-positive, RFD7-positive activated macrophages were present. Both perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates and PDGF-B receptor expression were generally also seen in macroscopically normal areas of the skin of the SSc patients, indicating that the observed phenotypic alterations may precede the macroscopically observable features of scleroderma in the skin. The observed induction of PDGF-B receptors, together with indirect indications of increased synthesis and release of PDGF, would be compatible with altered PDGF-mediated control of connective tissue cell growth as part of the molecular basis for development of the skin lesions in SSc.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Interleukin-2 immunotherapy in children. Immunotherapy with interleukin (IL)-2 possesses great potential in the treatment of immune-mediated diseases and cancers. However, only a few reports on a small number of children have appeared in the literature. From March 1988 to March 1989, 11 children and adolescents were treated with IL-2. They included 1 patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 with hepatoblastoma, 6 with childhood atopic dermatitis, and 3 with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The dosages ranged from 10,000 to 50,000 U/kg every 8 hours by intravenous drip. The following side effects were observed: anorexia, fever, and chillness (100%), general malaise (82%), irritability (64%), diarrhea (100%), nausea and vomiting (73%), weight gain (82%), edema (82%), abdominal distension (73%), oliguria (82%), cough (91%), dyspnea (27%), pleural effusion (40%), hypotension (82%), skin eruption (82%), oral ulcer (18%), enlarged liver (73%) liver function abnormalities (82%), renal function impairment (36%), electrolyte imbalance (73%), anemia (91%), thrombocytopenia (54%), leukopenia (18%), and eosinophilia (73%). Immunologically, numbers of natural killer cells were increased and natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cell activities were augmented after IL-2 treatment. There was a tendency for serum levels of IL-2 and receptor IL-2 to decrease, especially in patients with atopic eczema. Ten patients (91%) completed one course (9 to 12 days) of therapy, and the remaining patient interrupted the treatment because of intolerable adverse effects. Clinically, complete remission for 3 months was obtained in 1 juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patient, transient improvement (2 to 6 weeks) in all atopic dermatitis patients, minor response in the hepatoblastoma patient, and no response in the patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

In all groups T lymphocytes were predominant; however, the T4/T8 lymphocyte ratio was higher with lichen planus than with other groups. This may be of diagnostic value in the histologic evaluation of oral lesions not typical of lichen planus. Finally, a higher percentage of Langerhans cells were observed in lichen planus.

"Six epitopes reacting with human cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the central region of the HIV-1 NEF protein. In order to identify the target epitopes recognized by specific CTL in the NEF protein of HIV-1, 33 peptides derived from the HIV-BRU sequence were tested with NEF-specific CTL generated from HIV-seropositive donors. Six different epitopes were identified and several points were remarkable: 1) They were all located in two regions of the central part of the NEF protein corresponding to residues 73 to 94 and 113 to 147, respectively. 2) The CTL issued from a single donor could recognize several peptides of the NEF protein. 3) Some of these peptides could be recognized in association with at least two or three different HLA class I molecules. 4) Two different overlapping epitopes were present in a relatively short sequence of 15 amino acids. These results suggest that multiple epitopes corresponding to different HLA restrictions could coexist in a relatively small region of the NEF protein. The implications of these results in vaccine strategies using synthetic peptides bearing CTL epitopes are discussed.",Virus_Diseases
"Effects of haem arginate on variegate porphyria. Four patients with variegate porphyria (VP) were treated with repeated haem arginate infusions daily for 4 days and then weekly for 4 weeks. After the initial four daily doses of haem arginate (haem 3 mg/kg), the excretion of faecal protoporphyrin (mean 579 nmol/g dry wt) fell to an almost normal level (mean 123 nmol/g dry wt), and that of coproporphyrin (mean 162 nmol/g dry wt) to the normal level (mean 21 nmol/g dry wt) in all patients. However, during the period of the four weekly infusions of haem the excretion of porphyrins increased almost to the pretreatment level. Phototesting showed no changes in the photoreactivity of the skin, and no improvement in skin lesions was seen during the treatment. Except for one case of thrombophlebitis no side-effects occurred.

"Human-rodent contact and infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis and Seoul viruses in an inner-city population. We collected 1180 sera and 1363 questionnaires with information on demography, rodent exposure, and history of travel from persons visiting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Baltimore between 1986-1988. Serological tests for two rodent-borne viruses detected antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in 54 individuals (4.7%; n = 1149) and antibodies to Seoul virus (SEOV) in three persons (0.25%; n = 1180). Antibody prevalence to LCMV increased with age, but there were no racial or sexual differences. Neutralization tests and questionnaire responses implicated a domestic, rat-borne hantavirus as the source of SEOV antibody. Self-reported human-rodent contact indicated more exposure to house mice than rats within residences, although rats were more commonly sighted on streets. Infections with rodent-borne viruses were rare compared to the high rates of reported contact.",Virus_Diseases

"Transferrin C subtypes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Transferrin (Tf) subtypes were investigated in 128 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the frequencies of TfC subtypes were compared with the results in normal individuals. The frequencies of the Tf genes: C1, C2, C3, D1, and D2 were 0.4765, 0.3867, 0.0742, 0.0390 and 0.0234, respectively. The frequency of TfC2 gene was significantly higher in these patients (0.3867) compared to the value in the control group (C2 = 0.247). The relative risk of RA in association with TfC1C2 type was 2.0, while it was 0.18 in association with TfC1C1 type and the results were statistically significant. This paper confirms the significant association between TfC2 and RA. Furthermore, it appears from our results that TfC1 homozygous phenotype is protective for the development of RA. The results are discussed in the light of earlier suggestions that the TfC2 subtype confers an increased risk of cellular damage by enhancing hydroxyl radical formation, although it is possible that there exists a genetic linkage of Tf variant to some other locus which is influencing susceptibility to RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Human T-cell leukemia virus infection in non-intravenous drug using HIV seropositive men in Los Angeles. Sera from 634 homosexual men with Western blot-confirmed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were subjected to radioimmunoprecipation assay (RIPA) using an HTLV-I-infected human T-cell line (SLB-I). Sera obtained from Japanese adult T-cell leukemia patients, noninfected healthy individuals served as positive and negative controls. HIV-infected groups were comprised of asymptomatic homosexuals (n = 131), AIDS-related complex (n = 115), Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 300), AIDS-defining opportunistic infections (n = 76), and high-grade lymphomas (n = 12). Only two patients were known to be intravenous drug users. No instances of dual retroviral infection were detected. As a corollary, no cross reactivity between HTLV and HIV gene products was noted by RIPA. We conclude that HTLV infection is uncommon among select groups of HIV seropositive homosexuals who do not engage in intravenous drug abuse. Additional studies examining the seroprevalence and consequence of HTLV infection in broader based populations at risk for retroviral infection are required.",Virus_Diseases

"Non-invasive evaluation of long-term cardiac effects of captopril in systemic sclerosis. Impairment of left ventricular (LV) function has previously been reported in patients with systemic sclerosis (SScl). An intermittent vasospastic process in the myocardium may contribute to the development of myocardial dysfunction. Vasodilators may therefore be potentially useful in the treatment of cardiac dysfunction in patients with SScl. This study was designed to evaluate the long-term effects of captopril on the myocardial function of patients with SScl. Twenty-two patients with SScl (15 patients with diffuse scleroderma and 7 patients with CREST syndrome, i.e. calcinosis. Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal hypomotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia) were investigated by means of Doppler and echophonocardiography before and after treatment with captopril (1.3 mg kg-1 body weight d-1) for 11-15 months. There were no significant differences in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, end-systolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance or LV diameters before or after treatment. However, captopril treatment exerted significant effects on LV function: the pre-ejection period (PEP) and the ratio of pre-ejection period to LV ejection time decreased significantly (P less than 0.05). Mitral E-point septal separation decreased significantly (P less than 0.01), even after adjustment for LV end-diastolic diameter (P less than 0.01). The ejection fraction increased significantly (P less than 0.05), and the isovolumic relaxation time decreased (P less than 0.01). The left atrial emptying index increased (P less than 0.01). The Doppler peak late to early ventricular filling velocity decreased (P less than 0.05), and the isovolumic index was also reduced (P less than 0.05). We conclude that both systolic and diastolic LV function indices improved in patients with SScl after captopril treatment for a mean period of 1 year. The effects of captopril might be due to vasodilation of the myocardial vessels and/or a direct effect on the renin-angiotensin system of the heart.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Interleukin-1-induced interleukin-6 is required for the inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis by interleukin-1 in human articular cartilage. Cartilage from normal controls, patients with osteoarthritis, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis produced no interleukin-6 (IL-6) in culture. However, IL-1 induced massive production of IL-6 (up to 135 ng/ml) in cartilage from all 3 sources, in a dose-dependent manner (in some cases, a peak value was reached). The levels of induced IL-6 were similar to those found in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid. At IL-1 concentrations that induced almost complete inhibition of proteoglycan (PG) synthesis, IL-6 production could still be increased considerably. Exogenous IL-6 inhibited PG synthesis by up to 25%. IL-1-induced inhibition of PG synthesis was reversed by antibodies against recombinant human IL-6. These results suggest that IL-6 is required for the IL-1-induced inhibition of PG synthesis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"The role of CD4+ cells in sustaining lymphocyte proliferation during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. The murine immune response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection involves the activation of CD8+, class I MHC-restricted and virus-specific CTL. At times coinciding with CTL activation, high levels of IL-2 gene expression and production occur, the IL-2R is expressed, and T cell blastogenesis and proliferation are induced. We have previously found that, although both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets transcribe IL-2, the CD4+ subset appears to be the major producer of IL-2 whereas the CD8+ subset appears to be the major proliferating population when the subsets are separated after activation in vivo. The studies presented here were undertaken to examine the contribution made by the CD4+ subset to lymphocyte proliferation in vivo. Responses to LCMV infection were examined in intact mice and in mice depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ subsets by antibody treatments in vivo. Protocols were such that in vivo treatments with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 depleted the respective subset by greater than 90%. In situ hybridizations demonstrated that the IL-2 gene was expressed in non-B lymphocytes isolated from either CD4+ cell-depleted or CD8+ cell-depleted mice on day 7 post-infection with LCMV. When placed in culture, however, cells from CD8+ cell-depleted mice produced significantly higher levels of detectable IL-2 than did cells isolated from CD4+ cell-depleted mice on day 7 post-infection. IL-2 was apparently produced in vivo in mice depleted of either CD4+ or CD8+ cells, as expression of the gene for the p55 chain of the IL-2R, IL-2 responsiveness, and lymphocyte proliferation were observed with cells isolated from both sets of mice. Lymphocyte proliferation was shown to be sustained in mice depleted of CD4+ cells in vivo by three criteria: 1) non-B lymphocytes isolated from infected mice depleted of CD4+ cells underwent more DNA synthesis than did those isolated from uninfected mice or from infected mice depleted of CD8+ cells; 2) leukocyte yields were expanded during infection of CD4+ cell-depleted mice; and 3) CD8+ cell numbers were increased during infection of CD4+ cell-depleted mice. The majority of non-B lymphocytes having the characteristics of blast lymphocytes was recovered in the CD8+ populations isolated from infected CD4+ cell-depleted mice. These findings suggest that the requirement for the CD4+ subset to sustain CD8+ lymphocyte proliferation in vivo is limited, and that CD4+ and CD8+ cell types can function independently in many aspects of their responses to viral infections.",Virus_Diseases
"Treatment of urticaria and angioedema: low-sedating H1-type antihistamines. H1-type antihistamines are considered the therapeutic agents of choice for treating urticaria and angioedema.

"The post-occlusive hyperemic response in patients with systemic sclerosis.

Reactive hyperemia was measured over a locally warmed area of skin, using a laser Doppler flowmeter, following 5 minutes of suprasystolic occlusion of blood flow. We found that patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon had normal post-ischemic blood flow compared with normal controls. In contrast, patients with SSc had reduced levels of baseline and peak blood flow compared with either the primary Raynaud's phenomenon patients or the normal subjects. Infusion of carbaprostacyclin, a potent prostacyclin analog vasodilator, did not increase blood flow in the SSc patients, nor did it restore the reactive hyperemic response.

"Hepatitis C infection in children with hemophilia A and B. Antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were quantitated in stored sera from selected groups of hemophilic children (less than or equal to 18 years of age). During the period 1987 to 1989, seropositivity rates were as follows: untransfused hemophiliacs 0% (0 of 11 cases), hemophiliacs treated exclusively with vapor-heated factor VIII or IX concentrates 0% (0 of 9 cases), hemophiliacs treated only with cryoprecipitate or single donor blood products 0% (0 of 9 cases), and hemophiliacs regularly treated with unheated or dry heat-treated factor VIII or IX concentrates 95% (21 of 22 cases). Corresponding alanine aminotransferase (ALT) results were similar: values were always below the upper limit of laboratory normal (40 U/L) in untransfused hemophiliacs, hemophiliacs treated with vapor-heated factor concentrates, or those who received only cryoprecipitate or single donor blood products. By contrast ALT values were greater than 40 U/L in 82% (18 of 22 cases) of hemophilic children regularly infused with unheated or dry heat-treated factor concentrates. Three conclusions are drawn from this data: (1) HCV is a major cause of chronic hepatitis in multitransfused hemophilic children, (2) unheated and dry heat-treated clotting factor concentrates carry a very high risk of transmitting HCV infection, and (3) clotting factor concentrates inactivated by vapor heating carry a very low and perhaps zero risk of transmitting HCV infection.

We combined Dopa-Toluidine Blue complex stain, hair follicle split-Dopa stain, and hair follicle split-scanning electron microscope (SEM) to observe the changes of melanocytes in 23 normal, 24 vitiliginous, and 36 repigmented skin specimens. We found that only active (Dopa-positive) melanocytes existed in the epidermis of normal skin. There were some inactive (Dopa-negative) melanocytes in the outer root sheaths of normal hair follicles, which form the melanocyte reservoir in human skin. In the patients with vitiligo the active melanocytes in the epidermis were totally missing, whereas the inactive melanocytes in the outer root sheaths of hair follicles were not affected. Treatment stimulated the inactive melanocytes in the middle and/or lower parts of the outer root sheaths of hair follicles to divide, proliferate, and migrate upward along the surface of the outer root sheath to the nearby epidermis, where the melanocytes continued to migrate radially to form the pigmented island visible clinically in repigmented vitiligo lesions. During the migration to the epidermis, the melanocytes matured gradually from an inactive phase to an active condition. In conclusion, the existence of these inactive melanocytes provided the melanocyte sources for repigmentation of vitiligo.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Upper keratinocytes of psoriatic skin lesions express high levels of NAP-1/IL-8 mRNA in situ. In order to better understand the factors regulating disease promotion and activity in psoriasis (PS), we searched for the in situ expression of mRNA for various cytokines in long-standing PS skin lesions. Specific hybridization with a NAP-1/IL-8 anti-sense RNA probe was keratinocyte associated and yielded strong and specific signals exclusively in the upper layers of the lesional epidermis, but not in uninvolved skin from psoriatic patients or normal skin from non-psoriatics. Interestingly, NAP-1/IL-8 transcripts were focally clustered in a spotty pattern predominantly between the tips of elongated papillae, but were absent in the lower epidermal region and the dermal compartment. We consistently failed to detect appreciable numbers of TNF-alpha and/or IL-6 mRNA-containing cells in psoriatic lesions. These results support the notion that IL-8, rather than IL-6, is an important disease-promoting cytokine in PS. In view of the known in vitro and in vivo effects of IL-8, it is conceivable that this substance greatly contributes to the major pathologic changes seen in psoriatic skin, i.e., keratinocyte hyperproliferation and leucocyte infiltration. In this case, local pharmacologic down-regulation of NAP-1/IL-8 activity could be a promising therapeutic strategy in PS.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Combined APACHE II score and serum lactate dehydrogenase as predictors of in-hospital mortality caused by first episode Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We retrospectively analyzed data from 75 hospitalized patients with a first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to compare the ability of four parameters, including admission serum albumin, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, and the APACHE II score, to predict mortality and response to initial antipneumocystis therapy. The eight patients who died due to pneumocystosis and the 12 who failed initial antipneumocystis therapy had significantly higher admission mean APACHE II scores and serum LDH levels and lower mean serum albumin levels than did the 65 who survived and the 61 who responded to initial therapy (p less than 0.05 for each). Differences in mean alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients were not statistically significant with respect to survival or response to initial therapy. In a stepwise discriminant analysis of parameters associated with mortality, APACHE II score and LDH level were statistically significant (p less than 0.0001 for each). In a stepwise discriminant analysis of parameters associated with response to initial therapy, APACHE II score and LDH level were again statistically significant (p less than 0.0001, respectively). The addition of the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and serum albumin level did not further increase the predictive ability of the discriminant analyses. When analyzed alone, neither the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient nor the serum albumin were statistically significant in each discriminant analysis. The APACHE II score combined with the serum LDH may be more useful than other parameters, singly or combined, to more closely match patients with regard to severity of illness due to first episode Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia when comparing experimental new therapies with standard agents.",Virus_Diseases
"Treatment of molluscum contagiosum using a lidocaine/prilocaine cream (EMLA) for analgesia. Eighty-three 4- to 12-year-old children, scheduled for curettage of at least five molluscum contagiosum lesions, participated in a double-blind study. The children were randomly allocated to receive lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA) cream (n = 58) or placebo cream (n = 25), applied 15, 30, or 60 minutes before treatment. The pain was assessed by the children and the physician as none, slight, moderate, or severe. In addition, the children rated the pain on a visual analog scale. EMLA cream effectively prevented the pain after all three application times (p less than 0.01). No significant difference in pain was observed among the 15-, 30-, and 60-minute EMLA-treated groups, but the proportion of children reporting no pain on the verbal scale increased from 36% in the 15-minute group to 61% in the 60-minute group. In the placebo group, only one of 24 children (4%) reported no pain. Transient local redness was the only skin reaction noted. In conclusion, an application time of EMLA cream of less than 60 minutes is satisfactory for the curettage of molluscum contagiosum in children.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Bone mineral content in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: relationship to low-dose steroid therapy. Bone mineral content (BMC) of the distal forearm was measured by single photon absorptiometry in 142 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of whom 27/54 men and 44/88 women received low-dose steroid therapy (less than 10 mg/day). To study the effect of steroid therapy a case-control analysis was undertaken in patients matched for age, sex and disease duration. Steroid therapy was associated with a reduced BMC in men (1.16 +/- 0.29 versus 1.32 +/- 0.23; P less than 0.05) and post-menopausal (0.76 +/- 0.24 versus 0.91 +/- 0.25; P less than 0.02) but not pre-menopausal women (1.1 +/- 0.28 versus 1.1 +/- 0.17). Symptomatic fractures were more common in steroid-treated patients than in those who had not received steroids (10/71 versus 2/71; P less than 0.05). Serum osteocalcin, an index of bone formation, was measured in 106 cases. It tended to be higher in patients with RA than in controls but the values observed in steroid and non-steroid RA groups did not differ significantly. We conclude that low-dose steroid therapy is associated with increased bone loss and numbers of fractures in patients with RA but this does not appear to be the result of a simple defect in bone formation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Measles among the Amish: a comparative study of measles severity in primary and secondary cases in households. An outbreak of measles among a predominantly unvaccinated and susceptible Amish population in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, offered the opportunity to test the hypothesis that secondary cases in households are more severe than primary cases because the former have more intense exposure and receive a greater virus inoculum. Of 130 measles cases reported between April and June 1988, 119 (92%) constituted a study of disease severity. Severity was assessed by determining frequency and duration of symptoms, length of any hospitalization, and number of days in bed. In a univariate analysis, fewer secondary cases had conjunctivitis (relative risk [RR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.96) and headache (RR, 0.37; CI, 0.15-0.86), but more had earache (RR, 9.69; CI, 1.8-202.9) compared with primary cases. Secondary cases had a shorter mean duration of coryza (4.0 vs. 5.0 days, Student's t test, P = .08). However, a logistic regression model that matched by family and controlled for age and sex indicated that there were no significant differences in measles severity among primary and secondary cases in households.",Virus_Diseases

"Immunohistologic and ultrastructural comparison of the dermal papilla and hair follicle bulb from ""active"" and ""normal"" areas of alopecia areata. The ""active"" edges of patches of alopecia areata and normal areas from the same scalp (i.e., bearing normal terminal hair) from seven patients with alopecia areata were investigated immunohistologically. Similar areas from a further eight patients were examined using light and electronmicroscopy. ""Active"" and ""normal"" areas of alopecia areata scalps were immunohistologically similar and varied from normal controls in the number, distribution, and ratio for T4 and T8-positive cells. Similarly the ultrastructural changes seen in the ""active"" areas when compared to normal controls were also present in the ""normal"" areas of alopecia areata scalps. The most significant differences found between normal ""control"" follicles and both ""active"" and ""normal"" areas of alopecia areata scalps were the polymorphic nature of the dermal papilla cells and the loss of cellular organization within the dermal papillae taken from alopecia areata scalps. In addition, the junction between the dermal papilla and the bulb of the hair follicle, the dermo-epithelial junction of the hair follicle bulb, demonstrated critical changes in follicles taken from both ""active"" and ""normal"" areas of alopecia areata scalps. These results support the suggestion of a subclinical state of alopecia areata and indicate that further work on the etiology of alopecia areata should be directed towards the ""normal"" areas of alopecia areata scalps, in particular the cells of the dermal papilla and the dermo-epithelial junction of the hair follicle bulb.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Post-caesarean section analgesia: a comparison of epidural butorphanol and morphine. Epidural butorphanol 1, 2 and 4 mg were compared with morphine, 5 mg, for postoperative analgesia in 92 consenting, healthy, term parturients who had undergone Caesarean section under epidural lidocaine anaesthesia in a randomized double-blind study. Postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale and recorded with heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate. The demographic characteristics, and the incidences of primary and repeat Caesarean sections, were not different among the four treatment groups. At 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after treatment the median pain scores following butorphanol were similar and lower than those following morphine (P less than 0.05). Calculated median percentage pain relief values for butorphanol were higher than morphine at each of these times (P less than 0.05). At 90 min and 2 hr the pain scores and pain relief values were similar. Beyond 45 min the number of patients requesting supplemental medication and dropping out of the study increased progressively in both the butorphanol and morphine treated patients. The attrition profiles for butorphanol were different from morphine (P less than 0.01). The median time in the study was greater than 24 hr for morphine, and 3, 2.5 and 4 hr for butorphanol, 1, 2 or 4 mg, respectively. No patient developed a clinically important change in heart rate or blood pressure, and none experienced a decrease in respiratory rate below 12 breaths.min-1. One of 69 patients (1.4 per cent) who received butorphanol developed pruritus compared with ten (43 per cent) of 23 patients who received morphine. The global assessments of the adequacy of analgesia were indistinguishable between morphine and butorphanol. Epidural butorphanol provides safe, effective postoperative analgesia, has a prompt onset, and a limited duration.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Tenascin expression in hyperproliferative skin diseases. The expression of tenascin, a recently discovered extracellular matrix glycoprotein, was studied by immunohistochemistry in normal human skin and in a number of skin diseases with epidermal hyperproliferation such as psoriasis, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and solar keratosis. Tenascin expression in the upper dermis of normal skin was found to vary from almost absent to patchy along the basal membrane. Staining was continuous and intense around blood vessels, hair follicles and eccrine sweat ducts. In basal cell carcinoma a marked expression of tenascin was found in the tumour stroma, especially adjacent to the basal membrane surrounding the tumour cell nests. In Bowen's disease and solar keratosis, tenascin expression was found in the dermis next to the keratinocytes. In psoriasis the dermal papillae of clinically involved skin were intensely stained and a continuous band of tenascin was present in the upper dermis along the basal membrane. The distribution of tenascin differed from other known extracellular matrix components.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Evidence of marked sexual behavior change associated with low HIV-1 seroconversion in 149 married couples with discordant HIV-1 serostatus: experience at an HIV counselling center in Zaire. To determine the effect of an HIV-1 counselling program on 149 married Zairian couples with discordant HIV-1 serology, the rates of HIV-1 seroconversion and reported condom utilization have been observed during 382.4 person-years of follow-up (minimum follow-up time per couple of 6 months). Before determination of HIV-1 serostatus and counselling, less than 5% of these couples had ever used a condom. One month after notification of HIV-1 serostatus and counselling, 70.7% of couples reported using condoms during all episodes of sexual intercourse. At 18 months follow-up, 77.4% of the 140 couples still being followed reported continued use of condoms during all episodes of sexual intercourse. At the time of notification of HIV-1 serostatus, 18 couples experienced acute psychological distress. Home-based counselling by trained nurses resolved these difficulties in all but three couples who subsequently divorced. Intensive counselling following notification of HIV-1 serostatus led to low rates of HIV-1 seroconversion (3.1% per 100 person-years of observation) in Zairian married couples with discordant HIV-1 serostatus who voluntarily attended an HIV counselling center.",Virus_Diseases
"Total knee arthroplasty: a population-based study. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is being used increasingly for the management of chronic arthritis of the knee. In this report, we review the frequency of application of TKA in the population of Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1971 through 1986. The utilization rate of TKA increased from 20.5 per 100,000 person-years for 1971 through 1974 to 60.8 per 100,000 for 1983 through 1986. Although rates were higher in women, they increased with advancing age in both sexes. Rates between the urban and rural populations of Olmsted County did not differ. The two most common underlying diseases that necessitated TKA were osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis; they were the cause of more than 90% of all operations. By extrapolating the rates of TKA in Olmsted County to the total 1986 US population, we estimate a need for at least 143,000 TKAs annually at a direct cost of more than $2.3 billion each year.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Assessment of platelet antibody by flow cytometric and ELISA techniques: a comparison study. Two different methods for evaluating platelet antibody were used to study 12 normal subjects and 24 patients consisting primarily of intravenous drug users (IVDUs) who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Total platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were measured by enzyme-lined immunosorbent assay on platelet lysate, and platelet surface-associated IgG and IgM were measured by semiquantitative flow cytometry. IgG and IgM values showed significant correlations between the two measurement methods. Mean platelet surface IgG and total IgG were 3.6 and 4.3 times greater, respectively, in IVDUs than in controls, and platelet IgM was also significantly higher in IVDUs than in controls as measured by both techniques. Although mean platelet immunoglobulin levels were higher in the IVDUs with thrombocytopenia than in IVDUs with normal platelet counts, these differences did not achieve significance. These data show that platelet IgG and IgM levels are increased in IVDU-associated HIV infection and suggest that these increases are not confined to patients manifesting thrombocytopenia. The herein described platelet surface antibody and total platelet antibody measurements appear to be equally useful in studying this patient population. Specific details for generating platelet-associated immunofluorescence units are discussed.",Virus_Diseases
"Dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and premature death in melanocytes cultured from the vitiligo mouse. It has been proposed that the selective melanocyte destruction in hair bulbs of the murine model for vitiligo (VIT) is instigated by either the local cutaneous environment or an innate melanocyte defect. To address this problem, the authors have isolated the melanocyte population from environmental influences by using cell culture technology and have observed reduced proliferation, specific cytologic abnormalities, and premature cell death in cultures of pure VIT melanocytes established from neonatal skin. Cultured VIT melanocytes manifest abnormal compartmentalization of melanosomes and some aberrant dihydroxyphenylalanine-positive structures. The most prominent abnormality observed in cultured VIT melanocytes when compared with the control C57BL/6J cells is a development in dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) that morphologically resembles the in vivo condition. Dilation of the RER can be exaggerated in VIT or induced in C57BL/6J melanocytes by the addition of Brefeldin A to cultures. Conversely the dilated RER cisternae characteristic of the VIT melanocyte can be reversed by inhibition of protein synthesis with cyclobeximide. Melanocyte cultures developed from heterozygote neonates, resulting from cross-breedings between the VIT and the C57BL/6J lines, also demonstrated extensive RER dilation along with only slightly reduced proliferation. The results in this report verify that the murine vitiligo melanocyte expresses an innate defect that affects the structure and presumably the function of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Structure of recombinant human rheumatoid arthritic synovial fluid phospholipase A2 at 2.2 A resolution. Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) may be grouped into distinct families of proteins that catalyse the hydrolysis of the 2-acyl bond of phospholipids and perform a variety of biological functions. The best characterized are the small (relative molecular mass approximately 14,000) calcium-dependent, secretory enzymes of diverse origin, such as pancreatic and venom PLA2s. The structures and functions of several PLA2s are known. Recently, high-resolution crystal structures of complexes of secretory PLA2s with phosphonate phospholipid analogues have provided information about the detailed stereochemistry of transition-state binding, confirming the proposed catalytic mechanism of esterolysis. By contrast, studies on mammalian nonpancreatic secretory PLA2s (s-PLA2s) have only recently begun; s-PLA2s are scarce in normal cells and tissues but large amounts are found in association with local and systemic inflammatory processes and tissue injury in animals and man. Such s-PLAs have been purified from rabbit and rat inflammatory exudate, from synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and from human platelets. Cloning and sequencing shows that the primary structure of the human s-PLA2 has about 37% homology with that of bovine pancreatic PLA2 and 44% homology with that of Crotalus atrox PLA2. The human s-PLA2 is an unusually basic protein, yet contains most of the highly conserved amino-acid residues and sequences characteristic of the PLA2s sequenced so far. Here we report the refined, three-dimensional crystal structure at 2.2 A resolution of recombinant human rheumatoid arthritic synovial fluid PLA2.

"Contact and photocontact allergy to ketoprofen: clinical and experimental study. In the last 3 years, we have studied 10 patients with allergic reactions to topical ketoprofen. We have investigated the sensitization and irritant potential of the drug and the possibility of cross-reactivity with other aryl-propionic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuproxam, ibuprofen, naproxen, fenoprofen, flubiprofen and tiaprofenic acid). 2 of our patients had contact dermatitis, and the other 8 photocontact dermatitis. One of our patients showed cross-reactivity between ketoprofen and ibuproxam on patch testing. In the photopatch tests, we observed cross-reactivity between ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid in 2 patients, and cross-reaction between ketoprofen and ibuproxam and flurbiprofen in another case. Experimental studies, including human maximization and photomaximization tests, performed in 20 healthy volunteers, showed a complete absence of sensitization, 3 volunteers showed a marked irritant reaction to ketoprofen (20% pet.) during either maximization (2 cases) or photomaximization (1 case) tests. Although ketoprofen appears not to be a sensitizing agent in human volunteers, the fact that photosensitization to this drug seems to be quite common after topical use suggests that there are some local or individual factors, at present unknown, facilitating the development of allergy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Changes in lung mechanics and reactivity with age after viral bronchiolitis in beagle puppies. We measured changes with growth in lung function and airway reactivity after acute canine parainfluenza virus type 2 (CPI2, n = 5), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2, n = 7), and sequential CAV2-CPI2 (n = 6) infections or no infection (controls, n = 6) in beagle puppies (age approximately 79 days). In the CPI2 and CAV2 groups, a lower respiratory illness developed by day 3 postinfection with clinical recovery by day 14. In the CAV2-CPI2 group, puppies were inoculated initially with CAV2 and 12 days later with CPI2. In this group, illness persisted until day 14 after infection with CPI2. Lung resistance (RL), dynamic (Cdyn) and static (Cst) lung compliance, functional residual capacity (FRC), and responsiveness to aerosolized histamine were measured before infection and at periodic intervals until 239 +/- 43 days of age. Lung function data were analyzed using a longitudinal random effects model. In all groups, FRC, Cst, and Cdyn increased with age. In all infected groups, the regression slopes for Cdyn were steeper than in controls. RL decreased linearly with age without group slope differences. Histamine reactivity increased with age, but there were no differences in slope among groups. Lung pathological studies showed areas of obliterative bronchiolitis and chronic small airways inflammation particularly in the CAV2 and CAV2-CPI2 groups. Thus, viral bronchiolitis produces chronic small airways inflammation in beagle puppies and alters the changes in lung function occurring with growth. Histamine reactivity increases with age and is not modified by viral infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Evaluation of the anti-influenza virus activities of 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylcyanamide (LY217896) and its sodium salt. 1,3,4-Thiadiazol-2-ylcyanamide (LY217896) and its sodium salt were shown to be effective against influenza A and B viruses in vitro and in the mouse model. In nondividing confluent MDCK cells, the 50% inhibitory concentration of LY217896 ranged from 0.37 to 1.19 micrograms/ml against various strains of influenza A virus and from 0.75 to 1.54 micrograms/ml against various strains of influenza B virus, with no apparent cytotoxicity. However, at a concentration of 0.31 microgram/ml, LY217896 inhibited the replication of dividing MDCK cells. LY217896 (9 mg/m2 of body surface area per day) administered in the diet, in the drinking water, by oral gavage, by intraperitoneal injection, or by aerosolization was well tolerated and protected CD-1 mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A or B virus. Effective administration of the compound could be delayed for up to 96 h postinfection. Virus titer was reduced by 1 to 2 log10 units in lungs of mice given LY217896 in the drinking water. Mice treated initially with protective levels of LY217896 were resistant to a subsequent challenge of influenza virus in the absence of the compound, indicating that the animals were able to develop immunity to the initial infection.

"Non-invasive monitoring of finger arterial pressure in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon: effects of exposure to cold. We studied the effects of exposure to cold on finger arterial pressure (FAP) measured by a finger arterial pressure monitor in 15 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon and in 15 healthy volunteers. The cold exposure induced vasoconstriction of the peripheral vascular bed as judged by the plethysmograph of a pulse oximeter and had marked effects on FAP values compared with upper arm arterial pressure. Immediately after the cold exposure, FAP decreased significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) in both groups. However, during the subsequent 20 min, FAP values increased in relation to upper arm pressure. Finally, FAP values were greater than upper arm pressure in the control individuals, but not in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. These results have implications for non-invasive monitoring of arterial pressure by the finger pressure device.

"Hepatitis C in patients undergoing liver transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) among patients undergoing liver transplantation and the relation between anti-HCV and post-transplant hepatitis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PATIENTS: Serum samples from 128 patients who underwent liver transplantation. Sixty-six patients who had 6 months of follow-up and for whom both pretransplant and post-transplant serum samples were available were included in a study to asses the relation between anti-HCV and post-transplant hepatitis. MEASUREMENTS: Sera were tested for anti-HCV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and, if positive, two confirmatory tests were done. Patients had a biopsy every week until two specimens showed no abnormal findings. MAIN RESULTS: Only patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (15 of 30; 50%), alcoholic cirrhosis (7 of 19; 37%), and chronic hepatitis B infection (3 of 11; 27%) were anti-HCV positive. No patient with another form of chronic liver disease or with acute liver failure due to non-A, non-B hepatitis was anti-HCV positive. After transplantation, loss of anti-HCV was frequent and acquisition rare. Hepatitis developed in the graft in 17% of patients, but the incidence was similar among anti-HCV negative and anti-HCV-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is a common cause of chronic liver disease in patients requiring liver transplantation, but anti-HCV is rarely found in patients with acute liver failure. Previous HCV infection, based on detection of anti-HCV, is not an independent risk factor for post-transplant hepatitis.",Virus_Diseases
"A hospital-based prospective study of perinatal infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Most infants with pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and infections with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are infected perinatally by their mothers. To determine the proportion of exposed infants who are infected, we conducted a hospital-based prospective study in HIV-1-infected women whose infants were delivered at a single metropolitan hospital in Miami, Fla. A population of uninfected women and their infants was also enrolled and followed longitudinally for 2 years to assess laboratory and clinical measurements. The median follow-up is now 18 months for 82 infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers. The proportion of infected infants in this group is 0.30 (25/82). None of the infants born to 110 HIV-1-seronegative mothers were seropositive. Infected infants were easily distinguished from noninfected infants by virus isolation. No single immunologic or hematologic measure was predictive of infection for all infants at risk for HIV-1 infection who were 6 months of age or younger. As a group, however, infected infants could be distinguished from uninfected index infants by a number of immunologic measures by 6 months of age; the absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes and the CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio were the variables most predictive of infection. As in retrospective studies, clinical disease developed in 80% of infected infants within the first 24 months of life.

"A multicenter trial of oral zidovudine in children with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease. The Protocol 043 Study Group. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Zidovudine has been shown to be an effective antiretroviral treatment in adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We examined the safety of zidovudine and the tolerance of and therapeutic response to the drug in 88 children with advanced HIV disease. During a 24-week outpatient trial, zidovudine (180 mg per square meter of body-surface area per dose) was given by mouth every six hours and serial measurements were made of clinical, immunologic, and virologic indexes. Children who completed 24 weeks of treatment were permitted to continue receiving zidovudine. RESULTS. Of the 88 children (mean age, 3.9 years; range, 4 months to 11 years), 61 completed the initial 24-week trial, and 49 continued to receive zidovudine for up to 90 weeks (median follow-up, 56 weeks). The patients generally tolerated zidovudine well. One or more episodes of hematologic toxicity occurred in 54 children (61 percent)--anemia (hemoglobin level, less than 75 g per liter) in 23 children (26 percent) and neutropenia (neutrophil count, less than 0.75 x 10(9) per liter) in 42 (48 percent). Many of these abnormalities resolved spontaneously, but 30 children required transfusions or a modification of the dose of zidovudine. Only three children had to stop receiving the drug because of hematologic toxicity. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the probability of survival was 0.89 after 24 weeks and 0.79 after 52 weeks. There was marked improvement in weight gain, cognitive function (mainly in children less than 3 years old), serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of p24 antigen, and the proportion of cerebrospinal fluid cultures negative for HIV. CD4+ lymphocyte counts (mean at base line, 0.263 x 10(9) per liter) improved during the first 12 weeks, although the improvement was not sustained through the 24th week. CONCLUSIONS. Zidovudine in a dose of 180 mg per square meter every six hours can be safely administered to children with advanced HIV disease. The resultant clinical, immunologic, and virologic improvements in children are similar to those reported with zidovudine in adults.",Virus_Diseases
"Lymphocyte trafficking in psoriasis: a new perspective emphasizing the dermal dendrocyte with active dermal recruitment mediated via endothelial cells followed by intra-epidermal T-cell activation. Prominent within the inflammatory infiltrate of psoriasis are HLA-DR positive T lymphocytes and factor XIIIa positive dermal dendrocytes. Many investigators studying psoriasis have assumed that the HLA-DR positive T cells are activated, and thereby capable of producing lymphokines such as gamma interferon. However, by immunohistochemical analysis, greater than 95% of the dermal T cells in psoriatic lesions are Ki-67 negative, which suggests that they are in a resting or non-cycling (Go) state. In contrast to the dermal T-cell population, the epidermal T-cell population contains a greater population of Ki-67 positive lymphocytes. The entry of the T cells into the epidermis is, therefore, apparently associated with an important activation event, which in all likelihood involves interaction with the keratinocyte. The presence of activated intraepidermal T cells has been substantiated by the ability to detect gamma interferon mRNA by polymerase chain reaction in epidermal sheets of psoriatic lesions. The pathophysiologic implication in psoriasis for these distinctions and compartmentalization involving dermal and epidermal T cells are placed into the context of a cascade of cellular trafficking events, which are further dissected into a specific network of molecular mediators of inflammation. This report suggests that more attention should be placed on the microenvironment of the skin, with specific emphasis on the mechanism by which T cells accumulate in the dermis and epidermis, and elucidation of the selective inductive and recruitment capabilities of endothelial cells, perivascular dermal dendrocytes, and keratinocytes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Imipramine hyperpigmentation: a slate-gray discoloration caused by long-term imipramine administration. A 48-year-old white woman, skin type III, had a slate-gray discoloration of the face and dorsa of both hands after ingesting imipramine, 150 mg/day for 5 years. Her iris color was also darkened. One year after cessation of the therapy, the discoloration became lighter. Sun-protected skin showed no discoloration. Light microscopy revealed an accumulation of doubly refractile golden yellow granules in the papillary dermis, mostly scattered, with some concentration around the blood vessels but not in the endothelial cells. Electron micrographs showed numerous amorphous electron-dense inclusion bodies in histiocytes, phagocytes, fibroblasts, and dermal dendrocytes. Melanosomes were phagocytosed in the same cells but in separated locations. Imipramine is structurally related to chlorpromazine and can cause slate-gray discoloration. However, the color of the granules deposited in the papillary dermis is golden-yellow and they are not deposited in endothelial cells.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) is associated with proliferation of target cells that have been infected by a defective retrovirus. To control the growth of this primary neoplasia, virus-inoculated mice were treated with anti-neoplastic drugs. Paradoxically, cyclophosphamide, which is also immunosuppressive, was very effective in preventing the appearance and progression of the disease, in restoring a normal T cell function, and in depleting the number of infected target cells. This result suggests that the proliferating infected target cells were responsible for the immunodeficiency.",Virus_Diseases

"Inability of enzyme immunoassays to discriminate between infections with herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of three commercial enzyme immunoassays in detecting and subtyping antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Referral medical center. PATIENTS: Ninety patients with culture-positive lesions caused by infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. The results of Western blot and glycoprotein G immunodot enzyme assays showed that an additional 53 patients had subclinical herpes simplex virus 2 infection, that another 20 patients had subclinical herpes simplex virus type 1 infection, and that 23 patients were seronegative. MEASUREMENTS: Three commercial enzyme immunoassays were used to determine herpes simplex virus antibody subtypes. MAIN RESULTS: All three commercial assays performed poorly in all patient groups (except in patients who were seronegative for herpes simplex virus). Among the 40 patients with a first episode of genital herpes, seroconversion to the appropriate viral type was shown by the three assays in only 33%, 55%, and 75% of cases. Among patients with recurrent genital herpes, the three commercial assays identified more than 90% of patients with only herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies but failed to identify herpes simplex virus type 2 infections in 58% to 76% of patients with antibodies to both virus subtypes. The three assays correctly identified only 55%, 75%, and 85% of the 53 ""silent carriers"" of herpes simplex virus type 2. Overall, the three enzyme immunoassays detected herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies in 60%, 62%, and 93% of patients with subtype 2 infections and falsely detected type 2 antibodies in 8%, 27%, and 49% of patients with type 1 infections. CONCLUSION: Currently licensed enzyme immunoassays give inaccurate or misleading results about the correct herpes simplex virus infecting subtype.",Virus_Diseases
"New active analogues of vitamin D with low calcemic activity. In conclusion, a number vitamin D analogues have been developed that have very low calcemic activity but retain several other properties of 1,25-(OH)2D3, including the ability to differentiate leukemia and skin cells, to enhance the immune response, and to suppress parathyroid hormone levels. Although the mechanism of this selective activity is not yet clear, these analogues may provide new insights into the differences in action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in various target tissues. Most importantly, the selective action of these analogues may be exploited for the treatment of diseases such as leukemia, psoriasis and hyperparathyroidism.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Detection of replicative intermediates of hepatitis C viral RNA in liver and serum of patients with chronic hepatitis C. The hepatitis C virus is a positive stranded hepatotropic RNA virus. We describe a method of detecting positive and negative strands of hepatitis C viral RNA using the polymerase chain reaction. We tested serum and liver tissue from nine patients with chronic hepatitis C. The positive RNA strand of HCV was detected in the sera and livers of all nine, the negative strand was detected in the livers of eight (89%), and in the sera of five (55%). Titers of both strands of HCV RNA were determined by serial endpoint dilutions. The amount of the negative strand in the serum and liver was usually 10-100 times less than the positive strand. Predigestion of serum with ribonucleases did not alter the detection of the negative strand. This suggests that the negative strand found in the serum may be protected from digestion by being associated with virions.",Virus_Diseases

In a prospective study, the clinicopathological effect of prednisolone was evaluated in six patients with collagenous colitis. Prednisolone was associated with a significant decrease in stool frequency. However, the effect was transitory, since the diarrhoea recurred when prednisolone treatment was discontinued. There was a trend toward a diminished inflammatory response in the post-treatment biopsies, but the thickness of the collagen band remained unchanged, except in one patient.

"[125I]fibrin deposition occurs at both early and late intervals of IgE-dependent or contact sensitivity reactions elicited in mouse skin. Mast cell-dependent augmentation of fibrin deposition at early intervals in combined IgE-dependent and contact sensitivity reactions. When elicited in the skin of mice, either IgE-dependent immediate hypersensitivity reactions or T cell-dependent contact sensitivity (CS) reactions result in local extravasation of [125I]fibrinogen and deposition of [125I]fibrin. However, these two types of reaction differ in kinetics and in requirement for IgE, mast cells, or T cells. In the present study, we investigated the kinetics and magnitude of [125I]fibrin deposition in combined IgE-dependent and CS reactions elicited simultaneously at the same site and compared the results with those obtained when the two reactions were elicited at separate sites. We found that [125I]fibrin deposition in pure IgE-dependent reactions was greater at 2 or 6 h after challenge than at 24 h, but that significant fibrin deposition persisted at those sites 24 h after challenge. In CS reactions, [125I]fibrin deposition was detected as early as 2 h after challenge, indicating that fibrin deposition accompanies the ""early component"" of CS detected by Van Loveren et al. with the use of measurements of tissue swelling. But much more [125I]fibrin deposition was present in CS reactions at 24 h than at 2 or 6 h after Ag challenge. When IgE-dependent and CS reactions were elicited at the same site, [125I]fibrin deposition at early intervals (2 to 6 h) after challenge was increased three- to 25-fold compared with that seen in isolated CS reactions, but at 24 h the results in the combined reactions were virtually identical to those in CS responses. Studies in genetically mast cell-deficient and congenic normal mice indicated that mast cells were required for expression of the IgE-dependent augmentation of [125I]fibrin deposition observed at early intervals in combined IgE-dependent and CS reactions, but not for the [125I]fibrin deposition associated with ""pure"" CS reactions. These findings indicate that the net effect of IgE-dependent mast cell activation on CS responses is to increase the fibrin deposition associated with these responses, but this effect is appreciated only at early intervals after elicitation of the reaction.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM) after blood transfusion in a patient with CD2+ hairy cell leukemia. Hairy cell leukemia complicating hemolytic anemia developed in a 46-year-old woman. Morphologically and cytochemically typical hairy cells were found to express both CD20 and CD2 antigens. Expression of surface IgG of kappa-chain type and the rearrangement of Ig but not T-cell receptor beta genes confirmed a B-cell origin of the leukemia. Blood transfusion was followed by disappearance of the hemolysis and a marked improvement of the leukemia. However, the patient developed progressive spastic spinal paraplegia about seven months after transfusion and was diagnosed as having HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM) by the demonstration of HTLV-I antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. HTLV-I infection via the transfusion may have been involved in the hematologic improvement seen in this patient.

"Transforming growth factors beta 1 and alpha in chronic liver disease. Effects of interferon alfa therapy  BACKGROUND. Cirrhosis is a diffuse process of hepatic fibrosis and regenerative nodule formation of unknown pathogenesis. Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 induces the production of extracellular matrix proteins by liver cells and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in laboratory animals. TGF alpha is a hepatocyte mitogen that participates in liver regeneration. METHODS. Using Northern blot analysis, we studied the expression of TGF beta 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in liver specimens from 42 patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and 12 subjects with either normal or fatty livers. The results were correlated with measurements of procollagen Type I mRNA in liver tissue, procollagen Type III peptide in serum, and the degree of histologic injury. We also investigated whether TGF alpha mRNA would be detectable in biopsy specimens of livers with proliferative activity. RESULTS. TGF beta 1 mRNA expression correlated closely with the expression of procollagen Type I mRNA (r = 0.94) and serum procollagen Type III peptide (r = 0.89) and with the histologic activity index (r = 0.73). All patients with increased fibrogenic activity (serum procollagen Type III peptide level, greater than 11.9 micrograms per liter) had increased levels of TGF beta 1 mRNA (2 to 14 times the levels in the control group or in patients with normal fibrogenic activity), and both TGF alpha and H3 histone (a marker of DNA synthesis) mRNAs were detectable in patients with regenerative nodules. Six of eight patients with hepatitis C treated with interferon alfa for one year had sustained clinical responses with normalization of serum procollagen Type III peptide and aminotransferase activity. All these patients had normal levels of TGF beta 1 mRNA in liver specimens obtained at the end of the year. CONCLUSIONS. TGF beta 1 may have an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease, and TGF alpha expression may be associated with liver regeneration in these patients.",Virus_Diseases
"Intercellular IgA dermatosis of childhood. Selective deposition of monomer IgA1 in the intercellular space of the epidermis. We describe a 7-year-old girl with recurrent pruritic vesiculopustular lesions involving the trunk, extremities, face, and oral mucosa. Histopathologic examination revealed intraepidermal bullae containing neutrophils and eosinophils, and direct immunofluorescence test showed the deposition of IgA in the intercellular space of the epidermis. Circulating IgA anti-intercellular antibodies were also detected by indirect immunofluorescence test. Immunofluorescence studies using monoclonal antibodies to human IgA subclasses showed that these IgA antibodies belonged to IgA1. Antisera against J chain and secretory component did not show any specific intercellular staining. Surface IgA(+)-B cells were transiently increased in the peripheral blood during the active stage of the disease. These results indicated the extragut origin of these IgA antibodies.

"Increased HTLV-I proviral DNA in HTLV-I-associated myelopathy: a quantitative polymerase chain reaction study. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we quantitated the amount of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 18 patients with HTLV-I--associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis; 17 HTLV-I carriers without HTLV-I--associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, with or without other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases; and 19 seronegative control subjects. The HTLV-I proviral DNA was 10- to 100-fold higher in the patients and in the HTLV-I carriers without HAM/TSP who had autoimmune or inflammatory diseases than in the carriers without autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. The patients who had had onset of myelopathy at a younger age (15 to 39 years) had an extremely high level of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the early phase, as compared with findings in those with a late onset of myelopathy (at 44 to 61 years). The large increase in HTLV-I proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is presumably closely related to the development of autoimmune or inflammatory processes in HTLV-I carriers, including HTLV-I--associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis.",Virus_Diseases

"Congenital syphilis presenting in infants after the newborn period  BACKGROUND AND METHODS. There has been a recent, dramatic increase in the incidence of congenital syphilis, particularly in urban areas. We describe seven infants seen during one year who were first given a diagnosis of congenital syphilis at 3 to 14 weeks of age, when symptoms developed. We reviewed these infants' charts in order to ascertain the reasons for the failure to diagnose syphilis at birth and to identify the signs and symptoms of congenital syphilis in this group of infants. RESULTS. At delivery, four of the infants and their mothers had negative qualitative rapid-plasma-reagin tests for syphilis. The other three mothers had been seronegative during the pregnancy and were therefore not tested at delivery; two of their infants were seronegative at birth, and one was not tested. When the infants became symptomatic between 3 and 14 weeks of age and were admitted to the hospital, all seven infants and the five mothers available for testing were found to be seropositive for syphilis. Four infants presented with a characteristic diffuse rash; the other three presented with fever and were found on admission to have aseptic meningitis. All these infants had multisystem disease, as evidenced by hepatomegaly, increased aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, anemia, and monocytosis. In all the infants syphilis responded to parenteral penicillin. CONCLUSIONS. Congenital syphilis may be missed if serologic tests are not performed for both the mother and her infant at the time of delivery. Even when these tests are performed, some infants are not identified as having syphilis, probably because the infection is very recent and there has been insufficient time for an antibody response to develop. Some infants with congenital syphilis of later onset do not present with a typical rash; therefore, at least in areas where the disease is prevalent, serologic tests for syphilis should be included in the evaluation of all febrile infants, even those with negative results on serologic testing at birth.",Virus_Diseases
"Chlorhexidine gluconate and acetate in patch testing. Patch testing to chlorhexidine is usually performed with chlorhexidine gluconate aq. We report the results of 297 patients, almost all with leg ulcers, concomitantly tested with chlorhexidine acetate 1% aq. and chlorhexidine gluconate 1% aq. 39 patients had positive reactions to one of these compounds or to both. 36 positive reactions to the acetate were found, in contrast to 18 reactions to the gluconate. The reactions were considered relevant in 22 of 39 patients, since these patients had developed an eczema in an area where a chlorhexidine compound was used, and discontinuing the chlorhexidine compound resulted in improvement of the condition. In 10 of these 22 patients, the diagnosis would have been missed if the gluconate only had been used for testing, while the acetate failed to diagnose 2 patients. In 109 patients without leg ulcers, inconclusive patch test readings (i.e., irritant reactions or weak positive reactions) were found in 17% with chlorhexidine acetate 1% aq., compared to 5% with chlorhexidine gluconate 1% aq., indicating a high degree of irritant potential of the acetate 1% aq. We consider that some positive reactions are lost if chlorhexidine gluconate 1% aq. only is used for patch testing, but that chlorhexidine acetate 1% aq., on the other hand, is an unacceptably strong irritant. We therefore suggest that further testing with chlorhexidine acetate 1 and 0.5% aq. should be performed, in parallel with chlorhexidine gluconate 1% aq., in order to establish appropriate test concentrations. We find that up to 13% of the leg ulcer patients in this study may be sensitized to chlorhexidine, and we recommend that the indications for the drug in leg ulcer patients should be reconsidered.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Systemic and local administration of cyclosporine in the treatment of psoriasis. Since 1984, cyclosporine has been used increasingly for indications other than in prophylaxis of transplant rejection. Current awareness that psoriasis is, at least in part, a T cell-mediated condition has led to the initiation of several studies of cyclosporine's role in the treatment of this disease. The remarkable efficacy of systemically administered cyclosporine, even in severely refractory cases of psoriasis, has not only provided us with a new therapeutic option but also has helped further our understanding of the pathophysiology of psoriasis. Although it has been hailed as a breakthrough, systemic cyclosporine usage is associated with undesirable sequelae, principally hypertension and decreased renal function. These effects limit its more widespread use.

"The Marfan syndrome: abnormal aortic elastic properties. Aortic distensibility and aortic stiffness index were measured at the ascending aorta (3 cm above the aortic valve) and the mid-portion of the abdominal aorta from the changes in echocardiographic diameters and pulse pressure in 14 patients with the Marfan syndrome and 15 age- and gender-matched normal control subjects. The following formulas were used: 1) Aortic distensibility = 2(Changes in aortic diameter)/(Diastolic aortic diameter) (Pulse pressure); and 2) Aortic stiffness index = ln(Systolic blood pressure)/(Diastolic blood pressure)(Changes in aortic diameter)/Diastolic aortic diameter. Pulse wave velocity was also measured. Compared with normal subjects, patients with the Marfan syndrome had decreased aortic distensibility in the ascending and the abdominal aorta (2.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 5.6 +/- 1.4 cm2 dynes-1, p less than 0.001 and 4.5 +/- 2.1, vs. 7.7 +/- 2.5, cm2 dynes-1, p less than 0.001, respectively) and had an increased aortic stiffness index in the ascending and the abdominal aorta (10.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 5.9 +/- 2.2, p less than 0.005 and 7.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 3.9 +/- 1.2, p less than 0.005, respectively). Aortic diameters in the ascending aorta were larger in these patients than in normal subjects, but those in the abdominal aorta were similar in the two groups. Linear correlations for both aortic distensibility and stiffness index were found between the ascending and the abdominal aorta (r = 0.85 and 0.71, respectively). Pulse wave velocity was more rapid in the patients than in the normal subjects (11.6 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.5 +/- 1.4 m/s, respectively, p less than 0.01). Thus, aortic elastic properties are abnormal in patients with the Marfan syndrome irrespective of the aortic diameter, which suggests an intrinsic abnormality of the aortic arterial wall.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The treatment failure rate for women whose partners were also treated was not significantly different from that for women whose partners were not treated (6.8 versus 7.5%; P greater than .05), suggesting that treating genital condylomata in men does not affect the failure rate of cervical dysplasia in female sexual partners.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Cyclosporine in psoriasis treatment. Inhibition of keratinocyte cell-cycle progression in G1 independent of effects on transforming growth factor alpha/epidermal growth factor receptor pathways. Cyclosporine, an immunosuppressive drug, is effective in the treatment of recalcitrant psoriasis. Previous work suggested that keratinocyte hyperproliferation and inflammation are linked in psoriasis and that immune mechanisms participate in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha may be an important regulatory factor of epidermal growth as overproduction of TGF-alpha is associated with epidermal hyperplasia in psoriatic plaques and epidermal growth factor receptors are overexpressed in psoriatic epithelium. In this study, the effects of cyclosporine on cultured human keratinocytes were examined. Cyclosporine specifically inhibited keratinocyte cell-cycle progression in the G1 phase without causing keratinocytes to terminally differentiate. Cyclosporine did not decrease the expression of TGF-alpha or epidermal growth factor receptors. These results suggest that the effects of cyclosporine on psoriatic skin are unrelated to direct effects on autocrine growth regulation of keratinocytes via TGF-alpha production or of epidermal growth factor receptor modulation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The presence of autoantibody to recombinant lipocortin-I in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Corticosteroids may mediate some of their anti-inflammatory effects via induction of a specific 38 kDa protein, lipocortin-I. Anti-lipocortin-I antibodies (ALA) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 23 patients with plaque-type psoriasis alone (NAP), in 21 patients with psoriasis and arthritis (PA), and in 67 healthy controls. Only two of 23 NAP patients had elevated ALA, whereas six of 21 PA patients had raised levels of ALA (P = 0.2). Sero-negative polyarthritis was the most common pattern of joint disease in those PA patients with elevated ALA (4/6). ALA levels did not correlate with the extent or severity of cutaneous involvement, and are unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of cutaneous psoriasis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on the fibroblasts of scleroderma patients. The surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and class I and class II major histocompatibility complex molecules on cultured dermal fibroblasts from 7 scleroderma patients and 6 control donors was compared. Scleroderma fibroblast lines contained 41.0 +/- 3.0% (mean +/- SEM) cells with high levels of ICAM-1 expression (ICAM-1-high), whereas 26.9 +/- 1.5% of control fibroblasts were ICAM-1-high (P = 0.0003). There were no differences in the expression of class I and class II molecules. ICAM-1-high and ICAM-1-low fibroblasts produced equal amounts of total protein and procollagen. The increase in the number of ICAM-1-high fibroblasts in scleroderma patients may facilitate T cell activation and lymphokine production, and thus indirectly contribute to the fibrotic process.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Immunoenhancing properties and antiviral activity of 7-deazaguanosine in mice. The nucleotide analog 7-deazaguanosine has not previously been reported to possess biological (antiviral or antitumor) properties in cell culture or in vivo. Up to 10(5) U of interferon per ml was detected in mouse sera 1 to 4 h following oral (200-mg/kg of body weight) and intraperitoneal (50-mg/kg) doses of the compound. 7-Deazaguanosine also caused significant activation of natural killer and phagocytic cells but did not augment T- and B-cell blastogenesis. Intraperitoneal treatments of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day administered 24 and 18 h before virus inoculation were highly protective in mice inoculated with lethal doses of Semliki Forest or San Angelo viruses. Less but still significant survivor increases were evident in treated mice infected with banzi or encephalomyocarditis viruses. In most cases, the degree of antiviral activity was similar to that exhibited by the biological response modifier 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine. 7-Thia-8-oxoguanosine was more potent than 7-deazaguanosine against encephalomyocarditis virus in mice, however. Oral efficacy was achieved with 7-deazaguanosine treatments of greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg against all virus infections, whereas 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine is reported to be devoid of oral activity in rodents. Thus, 7-deazaguanosine represents the first reported orally active nucleoside biological response modifier exhibiting broad-spectrum antiviral activity against particular types of RNA viruses.",Virus_Diseases
"Entry of antivirally active T lymphocytes into the thymus of virus-infected mice. The thymus has long been regarded as an immunologically ""privileged site"" by being shielded against the entry of exogenous Ag as well as protective elements of the immune system. After i.p. infection of mice, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus multiplied in this organ. Viral Ag was found predominantly in the epithelial-reticular cells of the medulla and to a lesser extent in such cells of the cortex. Beginning on day 7 after infection, the virus disappeared, a process that could be blocked by depleting the mice of peripheral T lymphocytes or of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Viral clearance was accelerated by i.v. injection of splenocytes from mice, which themselves were just eliminating the virus. CD8+ cells from CD8-congenic donor mice, most with blast morphology, were detected immunocytochemically in the thymus, predominantly in the medulla. A few CD8+ T lymphocytes from donors not previously infected were also demonstrated in the thymic tissue of infected mice. Our findings indicate that the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has access to the thymus and suggest that it is cleared by the antiviral activity of circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Thus, just as other organs, the thymus appears to be subject to immune surveillance by mature T lymphocytes that have their origin in secondary lymphoid tissues.",Virus_Diseases
"The epidemiology and natural history of pressure ulcers in elderly nursing home residents  We analyzed prospective data from 19,889 elderly residents of 51 nursing homes from 1984 to 1985 to determine the prevalence, incidence, and natural history of pressure ulcers. Among all residents admitted to nursing homes, 11.3% possessed a stage II through stage IV pressure ulcer. For those residents admitted to the nursing home without pressure ulcers during the study period, the 1-year incidence was 13.2%. This increased to 21.6% by 2 years of nursing home stay. People already residing in a nursing home at the start of the study had a 1-year incidence of 9.5%, which increased to 20.4% by 2 years. Pressure ulcers were associated with an increased rate of mortality, but not hospitalization. Longitudinal follow-up of residents with pressure ulcers demonstrated that a majority of their lesions were healed by 1 year. Most of the improvement occurred early in a person's nursing home stay. Although nursing home residents with pressure ulcers have a higher mortality, with good medical care pressure ulcers can be expected to heal.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Measles antibody: reevaluation of protective titers. A school blood drive before a measles outbreak permitted correlation of preexposure measles antibody titers with clinical protection using the plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) test and an EIA. Of 9 donors with detectable preexposure PRN titer less than or equal to 120, 8 met the clinical criteria for measles (7 seroconfirmed) compared with none of 71 with preexposure PRN titers greater than 120 (P less than .0001). Seven of 11 donors with preexposure PRN titers of 216-874 had a greater than or equal to 4-fold rise in antibody titer (mean, 43-fold) compared with none of 7 with a preexposure PRN titer greater than or equal to 1052 (P less than .02). Of 37 noncases with preexposure PRN titer less than 1052, 26 (70%) reported one or more symptoms compared with 11 (31%) of 35 donors with preexposure PRN titers greater than or equal to 1052 (P less than .002). By EIA, no case had detectable preexposure antibody; the preexposure geometric mean titer of asymptomatic donors (220) was not significantly higher than that of symptomatic donors who did not meet the clinical criteria for measles (153) (P = .10). The study suggests that PRN titers less than or equal to 120 were not protective against measles disease and illness without rash due to measles may occur in persons with PRN titers above this level.",Virus_Diseases
"Screening potential blood donors at risk for human immunodeficiency virus. Even though all blood donated for transfusion is tested for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, there exists a period of time after infection by the virus before these antibodies can be detected. Blood donated during this window period is capable of transmitting the virus. Therefore, the blood of persons who are at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) should not enter the blood supply. Over a period of 4 months, 6573 potential blood donors who entered fixed and mobile blood collection sites in two cities were exposed to alternative interventions the aim of which was to exclude persons at risk for AIDS. We compared the interventions to one another and to existing materials in terms of the numbers of at-risk persons who did or did not donate for transfusion, the amount of attention paid to the materials, the scores on a comprehension test, and the self-reports by the subjects of attitudes towards the various interventions. At-risk donors who were asked direct AIDS risk behavior questions in addition to the current health history questions were more likely to be screened out than those who underwent alternative health history interviews (p less than 0.01). Potential donors paid more attention to the experimental brochures than to the experimental video or current materials (p less than 0.05). Comprehension scores were better for the new brochure and the video than for the current brochure (p less than 0.05). Donors were not offended by the experimental interventions.",Virus_Diseases
"Detection and partial sequencing of hepatitis C virus RNA in the liver. To detect hepatitis C virus RNA, total RNA was extracted from liver tissue, reverse transcribed to complementary DNA, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The reaction products were analyzed by ethidium bromide staining in acrylamide gel and hybridization with a radiolabeled probe. Hepatitis C virus RNA was thereby detected in 17 of 27 (63%) liver tissue specimens obtained from patients with non-A, non-B chronic liver diseases. Of these 27 patients, viral RNA was detected in 12 of 17 (71%) liver tissues from anti-hepatitis C virus-positive patients and in 5 of 10 (50%) liver tissues from anti-hepatitis C virus-negative patients. Direct sequencing of amplified complementary DNA (35 nucleotides) of the 17 RNA-positive samples showed only 66% to 77% homology to the reported hepatitis C virus complementary DNA sequence. These results indicate that the majority of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive patients are currently infected with hepatitis C virus, and some of the anti-hepatitis C virus-negative patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis are harboring hepatitis C virus in the liver. Detection of hepatitis C virus RNA appears to provide a useful indicator in the study of hepatitis C virus infection.",Virus_Diseases
"IgA-binding structures in dermatitis herpetiformis skin are independent of elastic-microfibrillar bundles. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized in part by the presence of granular deposits of IgA in the papillary dermis just beneath the dermal-epidermal junction. The nature of the structures to which IgA binds in DH skin, however, has not been clearly demonstrated. Previous immunoelectron-microscopy studies using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique have concluded that the IgA may bind to abnormal elastic microfibrillar bundles. Recently, antibodies have been developed against a major component of the elastic microfibril bundles, fibrillin. In addition, another dermal matrix protein, hexabrachion, has been characterized and found in normal human skin in a distribution similar to the IgA deposits of DH. Utilizing antibodies against fibrillin, hexabrachion, and human IgA and immunoelectronmicroscopy with immunogold staining techniques, we have examined the skin from patients with DH in order to localize the IgA deposits. Normal-appearing skin from five patients with DH exhibited electron-dense patches within the dermis, which were not seen in skin from normal subjects. These structures were sometimes adjacent to the basement membrane zone, but appeared amorphous and without a well-defined fibrillar structure. The electron-dense patches were labeled with anti-human IgA, but not with antibodies to fibrillin or hexabrachion. The anti-IgA antibody did not label the normal basement membrane. These studies confirm the presence of abnormal electron-dense, amorphous structures in the skin of patients with DH. Due to this lack of association with the elastic microfibril bundles and the lack of labeling with antibodies against fibrillin, we suggest that these deposits are distinct from the microfibrillar bundles of elastic tissue and may represent IgA bound to degraded basement membrane or isolated dermal deposits of IgA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Epidermal growth factor receptor of fibroblasts from patients with scleroderma. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) of fibroblasts from 3 patients with scleroderma (progressive systemic sclerosis, PSS) was studied by radioiodinated-EGF binding assay. The binding was 60.9 +/- 4.0% of normal fibroblasts, and the Scatchard plots showed a decrease in the affinity for EGF, not in the number of EGF-R. PSS fibroblasts expressed higher levels (1.15-2.45-fold) of RNA for the v-erbB (EGF-R gene). All-transretinoic acid (retinoid) had little effect on EGF-R, v-erbB gene expression and the proliferation of PSS fibroblasts. These data concerning the abnormality in the EGF-R may all constitute a feature of PSS fibroblasts.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Immunosuppressive effects of transforming growth factor beta: inhibition of the induction of Ia antigen on Langerhans cells by cytokines and of the contact hypersensitivity response. Recent reports show that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta exerts a variety of immunosuppressive activities. The present study focuses on the effects of TGF-beta 1 on expression of Ia antigen by Langerhans cells. Although TGF-beta 1, in concentrations from 0.001 to 100 micrograms/ml, has no effect on constitutive expression of Ia antigen on these cells, the in vitro up-regulation of Ia antigen on the surface of LC by interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, IL-3, and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor is inhibited by the concomitant addition of 1 microgram/ml TGF-beta 1. In contrast, TGF-beta 1 has no effect on the up-regulation induced by IL-2 or IL-6. In this report, the activity of TGF-beta closely resembles that of Cyclosporine A (CsA). Similar results are seen in vivo when either TGF-beta 1 (5 micrograms, intraperitoneally [ip], daily on days 0-3) or CsA (1 mg, subcutaneously [sc], twice daily on days 0-3) are given together with IL-2 (500 U, intraperitoneally [ip], twice daily on days 1-3) or interferon-gamma (4,000 U, ip, twice daily on days 1-3). Given the important role of Ia expression in cell-mediated immune reactions, the effect of TGF-beta on contact sensitivity was next investigated. In doses of 5 micrograms, ip, daily on days 6-8, TGF-beta inhibits the expression of contact reactivity in animals sensitized on day 0 and challenged on day 7. In contrast, no effect is observed on the induction of contact sensitivity in mice given TGF-beta 1 on days--1 to 2, sensitized on day 0, and challenged on day 7. The possible importance of antagonism between TGF-beta and other cytokines, especially IFN-gamma, involved in the elicitation of contact hypersensitivity reactions is discussed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in cerebrospinal fluid of AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus polyradiculomyelitis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) polyradiculomyelitis was diagnosed in 4 of 241 consecutive neurologically assessed human immunodeficiency virus type (HIV-1) seropositive patients. CMV-related neurologic disease was suspected on clinical grounds and was subsequently confirmed by CMV culture from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or CMV in situ hybridization on specific specimens. All four patients showed CSF pleocytosis with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Retrospective analysis of the results of CSF examination, performed in 143 of 241 patients with neurologic symptoms, showed pleocytosis in 58 of 143 patients. Predominance of PMNs was found in seven patients, including the four with CMV polyradiculomyelitis. It is concluded that in HIV-1 seropositive patients with a clinical diagnosis of polyradiculomyelitis, a predominance of PMNs in CSF could be an indication that the condition is CMV related. This should lead to early diagnosis and institution of specific antiviral therapy.",Virus_Diseases
"A novel autoantibody reactive with a 48 kDa tRNA associated protein in patients with scleroderma.

Furthermore, all 4 sera were found to react with a 48 kDa protein using immunoblotting. This protein was subsequently found to be associated with tRNA when immunoprecipitation was conducted. In a survey of autoimmune patients' sera, anti-Wa Ab was observed in 3% (4 of 130) of patients with PSS, but not in other systemic rheumatic diseases. None of the 4 patients with PSS with anti-Wa Ab had myositis except that one patient complained of mild myalgia.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody. The effect of treatment with a monoclonal antibody against the CD4 antigen present on T helper cells was studied in 10 patients with severe intractable rheumatoid arthritis. In an open trial, monoclonal antibody 16H5 was infused at a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg of body weight on 7 consecutive days. Studies of the kinetics demonstrated a drastic depletion of CD4+ cells, to as low as 25 cells/microliters, 1 hour after the first infusion. The subsequent recovery of the CD4+ cell numbers 24 hours after infusion did not reach initial levels, and after the full 7-day treatment cycle there was a significant reduction of the number of CD4+ cells (mean +/- SD 51 +/- 28%; P less than 0.02). There was a reduced or even inverse CD4:CD8 ratio, which generally persisted 3-4 weeks. Lymphocyte transformation assays demonstrated significantly reduced reactivity in 5 of the 9 patients who completed the 7-day course, whereas 4 individuals exhibited an unexpected elevation in the T cell response to mitogens and common antigens. Parallel laboratory studies showed a significant decrease in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P less than 0.05), rheumatoid factor titer (P less than 0.04), and total immunoglobulin values (P less than 0.01), as well as a reduction in C-reactive protein levels, in 7 of the 9 patients. Clinically, there was a significant reduction in the Ritchie articular index (P less than 0.05) and in the number of swollen joints (P less than 0.04). Adverse effects were urticaria in 2 patients, which led to withdrawal of therapy in 1 of them, and chills with fever, suggestive of a lymphokine release syndrome, in another 2 patients. Only low levels of human anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies developed (not exceeding 1.7 mg/liter). It was therefore possible to repeat the treatment cycle, achieving still better efficacy, in 4 of the patients (reductions in the Ritchie index and the number of swollen joints P less than 0.02). Our findings indicate that treatment with monoclonal antibodies against the CD4 antigen leads to immunomodulation which results in clinical benefits, at least during initial observation periods (up to 6 months postinfusion). However, it remains to be determined whether long-term remission can be induced with this therapeutic approach. The use of immunosuppressive therapies or repeated antibody treatments will have to be considered.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Effects of HIV infection on pregnancy. A clinical and immunologic evaluation. To understand better the effects of HIV infection on pregnancy, a group of 16 HIV seropositive pregnant patients was evaluated prospectively. Complications and results of pregnancy in these individuals were compared with those of 1,906 births at Charity Hospital, New Orleans during the time of the study. A subgroup of five patients underwent immunologic testing prenatally and postpartum. Thirty-one percent of HIV seropositive subjects had premature labor and low birth weight infants. Only 3.1% of the controls had premature labor and low birth weight infants (p less than or equal to .05). The percentage of C-sections was lower in the study group (12.5% versus 31.3%, p less than .10). All patients remained free of HIV-related disease through the postpartum period. Mean CD4 percentages were lower postpartum (21.9 +/- 3.4) than prepartum (45.1 +/- 6.7) in all five patients studied, although proliferative responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed were unchanged during the study period. One of the five seropositive patients who underwent immunologic testing with a CD4:CD8 ratio of less than 1.0 prepartum, had a progressive fall in CD4 percentages from 30% to 11% during the course of the study. HIV-I core antigen was not detected in the serum of any of the five patients during pregnancy or postpartum. Thus, HIV-I infection influenced both the course and outcome of pregnancy in the population studied. Further studies are indicated to assess the effects of pregnancy on the progression of HIV-related immunodeficiency in this population.",Virus_Diseases
"Epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in young children from Thailand. A prospective evaluation of the epidemiology and presentations of acute respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years of age admitted to Children's Hospital Bangkok (1988 to 1989) was supported by the World Health Organization.

Serum from 16 RF+ RA patients contained 2-252 micrograms/ml RF-CRI (geometric mean */divided by SD 20.8 */divided by 5.2), while serum from 11 normal adults contained 1-16 micrograms/ml RF-CRI (geometric mean */divided by SD 3.9 */divided by 2.3). Serum from 8 of the RF+ RA patients contained RF-CRI at concentrations more than 2 standard deviations above the geometric mean in the normal subjects (greater than 21 micrograms/ml).

"The role of chronic viral hepatitis in hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Although hepatocellular carcinoma is a relatively uncommon tumor in the United States, it is quite common in sub-Saharan Africa and the Far East, where most cases are associated with infection with the hepatitis B virus. We have studied 99 American patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection and compared these findings to those in a group of matched controls with other cancers. The two groups differed in proportion, with hepatitis B surface antigen in serum being significantly higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (7% vs. 0%, p = 0.009). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was also found more frequently in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (13% vs. 2%, p = 0.002). The relative risk for hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients was calculated to be 17.3 and for antibody to hepatitis C virus to be 7.3. The attributable fraction of cases related to the hepatitis B surface antigen carrier state was 6.7% and for patients infected with the hepatitis C virus was 11.4%. Approximately three quarters of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma did not have evidence of either hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus infection. These findings provide strong evidence that hepatitis C virus infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in the United States may even play a more important role than the hepatitis B virus.",Virus_Diseases

"Examination of tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCSA) photoallergy using in vitro photohapten-modified Langerhans cell-enriched epidermal cells. Lymphocytes from BALB/c mice photosensitized in vivo to tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCSA) were investigated to determine whether they could be stimulated to proliferate when cultured with Langerhans cell-enriched cultured epidermal cells (LC-EC) photohapten-modified in vitro with TCSA + UVA radiation. Cultured LC-EC were photohapten-modified in vitro by irradiation in TCSA-containing medium using a 1000-watt solar simulator equipped with filters to deliver primarily UVA radiation (320-400 nm). Lymphocytes from TCSA-photosensitized mice were incubated with LC-EC that had been treated in vitro with 0.1 mM TCSA and 2 J/cm2 UVA radiation (TCSA + UVA). Responder lymphocytes demonstrated a significant increase in their blastogenesis response compared to lymphocytes that were incubated with LC-EC irradiated with UVA prior to treatment with TCSA (UVA/TCSA) or with LC-EC that had received no treatment. Lymphocytes from naive mice or mice photosensitized with musk ambrette (MA) demonstrated a significantly lower response to LC-EC modified with TCSA + UVA, indicating the specificity of the response. Maximum blastogenesis response was achieved when LC-EC were treated with 0.1 mM TCSA and a UVA radiation dose of at least 0.5 J/cm2. Epidermal cells depleted of LC by treatment with anti-Ia antibody plus complement or by an adherence procedure were unable to stimulate this blastogenesis response. Epidermal cells treated in vitro with TCSA + UVA demonstrated enhanced fluorescence compared to control cells. The fluorescence observed was not restricted to any specific epidermal cell type; however, fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that dendritic Ia-positive cells, presumably LC, were also TCSA fluorescent. Flow cytometry showed that Ia-positive epidermal cells demonstrated the greatest UV fluorescence when treated with TCSA + UVA compared to both cells irradiated with UVA and subsequently treated with TCSA and untreated cells. This is consistent with the enhanced antigen presentation capability of TCSA + UVA treated LC-EC, which leads to the conclusion that LC photohapten-modified in vitro with TCSA + UVA demonstrate enhanced TCSA fluorescence and are capable of stimulating lymphocytes from TCSA photosensitized mice in an antigen-specific manner.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Synovial fluid ATP: a potential substrate for the production of inorganic pyrophosphate. The enzyme nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPPPH) is present in all joint fluids and on intraarticular cells. It generates inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) from nucleoside triphosphate substrate, thus serving as a potential source of the PPi which forms in the cartilages of patients with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition. NTPPPH is also important in matrix vesicle induced calcification with basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals. An articular substrate for this enzyme was sought. ATP was measured in the joint fluids from 107 patients with various forms of arthritis. Synovial fluid ATP levels were higher in patients with CPPD deposits than in osteoarthritis (p less than 0.02) or rheumatoid arthritis (p less than 0.002). ATP also correlated with PPi concentration (p less than 0.05) and with the presence of BCP crystals (p less than 0.05), but not with cellularity of the fluid, NTPPPH activity, or age of the donor. This substrate for NTPPPH may contribute to CPPD crystal deposition by generating PPi and may stimulate matrix vesicle induced formation of BCP crystals in several forms of arthritis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"C-reactive protein levels during disease exacerbations and infections in systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective longitudinal study. We prospectively studied the value of measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to distinguish between disease exacerbation and infection. During a 2 year followup of 71 lupus patients, 38 episodes of disease exacerbation and 36 episodes of infection could be analyzed. Plasma samples were obtained at least once a month. CRP levels were increased (greater than 6 mg/l) during 25 of the 38 exacerbations and during 32 of the 36 infections. Median CRP levels during infection (60 mg/l; range 1-400) were higher than during disease exacerbation (16.5 mg/l; range 1-375) (p less than 0.05). Levels of CRP rose prior to the exacerbation (p less than or equal to 0.01) and fell afterwards (p less than or equal to 0.01). During exacerbations accompanied by serositis, median levels of CRP (76 mg/l; range 2-375) were higher than during exacerbations without serositis (16 mg/l; range 1-53) (p less than 0.02). CRP levels exceeding 60 mg/l during exacerbations without serositis indicated infection in all cases.

"Simian immunodeficiency virus infection of macaques: end-stage disease is characterized by widespread distribution of proviral DNA in tissues. Four simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques in the terminal stages of AIDS were studied. Easily detectable unintegrated proviral DNA was present in nearly every tissue (lymphoid and nonlymphoid) examined. SIV-specific immunohistochemistry revealed that macrophages or macrophage-like cells were the predominant reservoirs for SIV. High burdens of infectious SIV were also characteristic of end-stage disease. At the molecular level, sequence analyses of molecular clones derived directly from tissue demonstrated that SIV, like other RNA viruses, exists as a mixture of closely related genomes. Viruses derived by cocultivation seemed to be selected for their ability to grow in tissue culture and did not represent the wide spectrum of genotypes in tissues. These data indicate that SIV-induced immunodeficiency is a complex, multisystem disease and that SIV replication, in addition to impairing the immune system, may have direct deleterious effects on multiple organ systems.",Virus_Diseases
"Isolation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in cutaneous blister fluid. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been isolated from a number of body fluids, including semen, tears, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, breast milk, alveolar fluid, and vaginal fluid, but it has not been isolated from fluid-containing skin lesions. We report the isolation of HIV-1 from cutaneous blister fluid in a patient with concomitant HIV-1 infection and porphyria cutanea tarda. Although transmission of HIV-1 through casual contact has not been reported, appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid direct contact with cutaneous fluid-containing lesions in HIV-1-positive patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Prevaccination serologic screening for measles in health care workers. A model was developed from which the cost-effectiveness of prevaccination serologic screening for measles could be estimated, for any combination of antibody screening costs and prevalence of antibody to measles. This model was tested using sera obtained prospectively from 222 health care workers, including 181 born in or after 1957 who had no history of measles, no measles vaccine after 1980, and no documentation of immunity to measles. In addition, 41 subjects born before 1957 who had no history of measles were studied. A rapid, reliable, and inexpensive ($5 per test) commercial ELISA was used to test for antibodies to measles; its seroprevalence in the subject population was 86%. From the model, it was estimated that prevaccination serologic testing would be cost-effective if antibody screening cost less than or equal to $12.75 per test. In this subject population, prevaccination serologic screening for measles was cost-effective.",Virus_Diseases
"Measles in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza: continuing incidence and the case for a new eradication strategy. Measles continues to occur in epidemic waves in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank, causing morbidity and mortality. In Israel, immunization of infants against measles began in 1967, and 90% had been immunized by the mid-1980s. In Gaza and the West Bank, where immunization of infants against measles began in 1973 and 1976, respectively, the immunization rate reached 75% in the late 1970s and increased to greater than 90% in the 1980s. Measles epidemics, which previously had occurred in 5- to 7-year cycles, occurred every 2-4 years in the 1980s and affected individuals who were older than those affected in previous years. Israel's commitment to eradicating measles by 1992 will require a substantially expanded immunization program in comparison with the traditional program that requires immunization of infants alone. The benefits of several alternative immunization strategies considerably exceed their costs. A new, two-dose immunization will be needed as a minimal strategy, and a campaign for administering booster doses to school-aged children may be required as well to achieve control and eradication of measles. Measles is a serious but preventable public health problem; appropriate strategies must be devised by national and international public health officials to control the disease in developing and developed countries.",Virus_Diseases
"Extracorporeal photopheresis in psoriasis vulgaris: clinical and immunologic observations. Four patients with chronic refractory plaque-type psoriasis without arthropathy were treated with extracorporeal photopheresis every other week for 6 to 13 months. In patients 1 and 2, methotrexate was administered concomitantly during the initial part of the trial; the dose was gradually tapered and the drug was discontinued by 6 months. Both patients improved to 23% and 62% of baseline values for percentage of body surface involvement, but their disease then flared when maintenance extracorporeal photopheresis was used alone. Substantial improvement again occurred when lower doses of methotrexate were administered with extracorporeal photopheresis. Patients 3 and 4 were treated initially with extracorporeal photopheresis alone and both improved to 50% and 52% of baseline body surface involvement, respectively, after 4 months of treatment. However, their disease flared because of factors unrelated to treatment. Extracorporeal photopheresis was well tolerated by all patients without evidence of overt toxicity. However, prolonged treatment with extracorporeal photopheresis/methotrexate was accompanied by a decrease in skin reactivity to recall antigens and by decreased capacity of lymphocytes to produce interleukin 2 in response to polyclonal stimuli in vitro. These findings indicate that alternate-week extracorporeal photopheresis has a definite but incomplete suppressive effect on psoriasis vulgaris that may be mediated through an effect on lymphokine production by photomodified cells and that the therapeutic effect of extracorporeal photopheresis may be enhanced by concomitant administration of low doses of methotrexate.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Biologic effects of interferons. If one were to review articles on IFN published between 1957 and 1967 it would become apparent that virtually none of the tenets held then are still valid today. Whereas IFN was long considered to be a specific antiviral substance without any effect on normal cellular metabolism, we accept today that it affects normal cell division and many specialized cellular functions. In this respect it is not unique; IFN is a prototype of a family of similar substances now called cytokines that all appear to function as regulatory molecules. It was held that the production of IFN constituted a specific response to a viral infection. Today we believe that IFN is an integral part of a cytokine network and that they and other cytokines may be produced constitutively at low levels. These substances exert multiple effects on virtually all cells. They play an important role in host defense against viral and parasitic infections, and in the resistance to experimental tumors. IFN can be shown to exert effects on the immune system and on lymphocyte circulation. Lastly, because of the multiplicity of their biologic effects, they may even contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases. Thus, when large amounts of IFN are administered or induced in newborn mice they can cause liver, kidney, and pulmonary disease. The field of IFN and cytokine research continues to expand and there is an increasing number of therapeutic applications. Twenty years from now, scientists and clinicians may be surprised that we understood so little of how IFN act and how inadequately we used them to treat disease.",Virus_Diseases

"Drug use and HIV-1 infection: report from the Second Italian Multicenter Study. A cross-sectional study was carried out in October 1988 among clients of public health centers in Italy that provide assistance for drug dependency. In addition to estimating the frequency of HIV-1 infection and of risk factors related to drug use, the study estimated the temporal gap between relevant events in the drug history of each subject. Forty-eight centers participated, representing 16 of the 20 Italian regions. Among 1,038/1,348 subjects, 395 (38%) were carriers of HIV-1 antibodies. Seropositivity was related to the length of heroin use (with the risk of being seropositive increasing by 1% for each month of use), to frequency of sharing injection equipment, and to sexual intercourse with a seropositive partner. Women were more likely to have shared injection equipment and to have engaged in sexual intercourse with seropositive partners. Most subjects began sharing injection equipment within a year of initiating drug use, and the median temporal gap between first drug use and first visit to a drug dependency center was 5 years. A high proportion of both seropositive (87%) and seronegative (74%) subjects reported the adoption of safer drug-use practices. In both groups many behavioral changes (38%) were reported to have been introduced before the initial HIV test. These findings confirm that efforts to reduce HIV infection among drug users in Italy will need to concentrate both on prevention of drug use and on early intervention to reduce high-risk behaviors.",Virus_Diseases
"Observations after human immunodeficiency virus immunization and challenge of human immunodeficiency virus seropositive and seronegative chimpanzees. Two human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive chimpanzees (A-3 and A-86c) infected 4 yr earlier with HIV, along with one uninfected animal (A-36), were inoculated intramuscularly three times in a year with a gamma-irradiated gp120-depleted HIV immunogen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Both previously infected animals promptly developed an anamnestic humoral antibody response after the first dose, and the uninfected animal developed a primary humoral response to the first dose and then an anamnestic response to the second dose. Although HIV had been recovered repeatedly from the seropositive animals, they became persistently virus-culture negative at the time of or just before the first inoculation of the immunogen. Intravenous challenge with 40 chimpanzee-infectious-doses of a heterologous HIV strain (HIVIIIB) was done 4 mo after the third inoculation in the three treated chimpanzees and in an untreated control animal (A-189a). The immunized naive animal (A-36) and the unimmunized control (A-189a) became infected, and virus has been isolated from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells for greater than 2 yr after challenge. However, the two previously infected chimpanzees (A-3 and A-86c) resisted challenge and have remained virus negative by peripheral blood mononuclear cell cocultivation for greater than 2 yr of observation after challenge; moreover, no evidence of reinfection was detectable by PCR. Despite the in vivo resistance, however, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the resistant animals (A-3, A-86c) remained susceptible to infection by HIV in vitro. These findings reveal that a state of immunity can develop and/or be induced to control and/or prevent HIV infection in the chimpanzees. In the absence of any detectable level of neutralizing antibody in A-3 and a low level in A-86c, the patterns of the responses to challenge seen in the four animals suggest that the cell-mediated immune mechanism must have played a significant role in the resistant chimpanzees both in control of their HIV infection and in their resistance to challenge.",Virus_Diseases
"Linkage of Marfan syndrome and a phenotypically related disorder to two different fibrillin genes  Marfan syndrome (MFS), one of the most common genetic disorders of connective tissue, is characterized by skeletal, cardiovascular and ocular abnormalities. The incidence of the disease is about 1 in 20,000, with life expectancy severely reduced because of cardiovascular complications. As the underlying defect is unknown, MFS diagnosis is based solely on clinical criteria. Certain phenotypic features of MFS are also shared by other conditions, which may be genetically distinct entities although part of a clinical continuum. Immunohistochemical studies have implicated fibrillin, a major component of elastin-associated microfibrils, in MFS aetiology. Genetic linkage analysis with random probes has independently localized the MFS locus to chromosome 15. Here we report that these two experimental approaches converge with the cloning and mapping of the fibrillin gene to chromosome 15q15-21, and with the establishment of linkage to MFS. We also isolated a second fibrillin gene and mapped it to chromosome 5q23-31. We linked this novel gene to a condition, congenital contractural arachnodactyly, that shares some of the features of MFS. Thus, the cosegregation of two related genes with two related syndromes implies that fibrillin mutations are likely to be responsible for different MFS phenotypes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Use of polymerase chain reaction for the early detection of HIV infection in the infants of HIV-seropositive women. Forty-two infants of HIV-seropositive women were evaluated to determine the value of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the early detection of HIV infection. All infants less than 6 months old had a simultaneous PCR and culture for HIV. There was an 88% concordance between the two techniques. PCR results showed an excellent correlation with clinical outcome; no PCR-negative patient has subsequently been found to be infected. Occasional false-positive or equivocal PCR results did occur. There was one false-negative culture. PCR is a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test for the early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants at risk, but at present it should be performed in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and good clinical follow-up.",Virus_Diseases
"Detection of Epstein-Barr virus messenger RNA in Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease by in situ hybridization with biotinylated probes on specially processed modified acetone methyl benzoate xylene (ModAMeX) sections. Microscopic intracellular detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) messenger RNA in Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease (HD) was possible by in situ hybridization, in tissue sections prepared by a method termed modified acetone methyl benzoate xylene (ModAMeX). The ModAMeX method was initially developed for simultaneous optimal preservation of leucocyte differentiation antigens and morphology. Two biotinylated DNA probes, corresponding to the same BamHI-W (internal repeat) of the EBV genome were used. EBV mRNA was detected in neoplastic cells in 16 of 54 (30%) lymph node biopsy specimens from usual subtypes of HD (lymphocyte predominance, 0/5; nodular sclerosis, 4/22; mixed cellularity, 12/26; unclassified, 0/1). EBV mRNA was also detected in the lymph node biopsy of 1 additional human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related case of HD (mixed cellularity) and in 2 of 4 cases of B-cell lymphomas occurring in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, EBV mRNA was detected in only 1 of 41 cases. Cases of HD positive for EBV mRNA were immunostained by CD30 and CD15 antibodies. The hybridization signals were exclusively restricted to Reed-Sternberg cells and variants. When analyzed retrospectively, no statistically significant correlation emerged between hybridization findings, EBV serology, or disease outcome over the 3 years of the availability of ModAMeX technique. The findings support the contention of a direct role of EBV in the pathogenesis of HD, at least in some cases.",Virus_Diseases

Twenty-two patients were treated with acyclovir. Nine patients were not treated. No severe complications occurred in any of the 31 patients. Minor complications, including prolonged fever, localized secondary infections, persistent cough, and prolonged fatigue were more frequent in the untreated group. If the acyclovir therapy was begun within the first 24 hours of varicella exanthem, then the rash and clinical illness were dramatically lessened.

"Tyrosinase gene mutations associated with type IB (""yellow"") oculocutaneous albinism [ublished erratum appears in Am J Hum Genet 1991 Sep;49(3):696] We have identified three different tyrosinase gene mutant alleles in four unrelated patients with type IB (""yellow"") oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and thus have demonstrated that type IB OCA is allelic to type IA (tyrosinase negative) OCA. In an inbred Amish kindred, type IB OCA results from homozygosity for a Pro----Leu substitution at codon 406. In the second family, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for a type IA OCA allele (codon 81 Pro----Leu) and a novel type IB allele (codon 275 Val----Phe). In the third patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the same type IB allele (codon 275 Val----Phe) and a novel type IB OCA allele. In a fourth patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the codon 81 type IA OCA allele and a type IB allele that contains no identifiable abnormalities; dysfunction of this type IB allele apparently results from a mutation either well within one of the large introns or at some distance from the tyrosinase gene. In vitro expression of the Amish type IB allele in nonpigmented HeLa cells demonstrates that the Pro----Leu substitution at codon 406 greatly reduces but does not abolish tyrosinase enzymatic activity, a finding consistent with the clinical phenotype.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Immediate contact reactions to chemicals in the fragrance mix and a study of the quenching action of eugenol. In this study, the nature of non-immune immediate contact reactions (NIICR) produced by cinnamic aldehyde, benzoic acid and sorbic acid were investigated, with particular interest in the 'quenching' ability of eugenol. Three groups of human subjects were studied, and the guinea-pig ear was also used as a model of NIICR. Cinnamic aldehyde, benzoic acid and sorbic acid were all able to produce NIICR in the majority of subjects studied. There was a strong correlation between the susceptibility of each subject to each urticant, but no correlation between the susceptibility to NIICR and age, atopic status or tanning ability. Eugenol caused a reduction in NIICR induced by all three urticants. This 'quenching' effect was apparent even when the eugenol was applied up to 60 min prior to application of cinnamic aldehyde, and its effect was not eliminated by washing. In the guinea-pig-ear model, ear thickening was induced by all three urticants, and this response was inhibited by eugenol.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"HIV seroprevalence among patients admitted to two psychiatric hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The authors determined the seroprevalence of HIV-1 among patients admitted to two psychiatric hospitals in New York City. METHOD: Patients consecutively admitted to an acute psychiatric unit in Manhattan and a large state hospital in Queens were anonymously tested for HIV-1 antibodies from December 1989 through July 1990. Test results were linked to age, gender, ethnicity, and two risk behaviors: male homosexual activity and injection drug use. RESULTS: Blood was obtained from 83.0% of the eligible patients. The prevalence of HIV was 5.5% (25 of 451). Black patients accounted for 38.0% of the patients tested and 76.0% of positive results (N = 19), a rate of 11.1% for this group. The rate of seropositivity was comparable in women and men. Clinicians had charted risk behavior for nine (36.0%) of the 25 HIV-positive patients. Infection control records suggested that clinicians were aware of seven (28.0%) of the positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: One in every 18 patients admitted to two public psychiatric hospitals in New York City was HIV positive. Clinical staff largely failed to identify HIV-positive patients. Ethnicity and a history of homosexual activity among men or use of injected drugs were strongly associated with seropositivity. This pattern of infection may be linked to needle sharing and/or sexual activity with partners who have shared needles. Future research should clarify how psychiatric illness affects risk-taking behavior, focus on improving detection by clinicians, and identify effective prevention strategies in this population.",Virus_Diseases

"Rapid and quantitative detection of enzymatically amplified HIV-1 DNA using chemiluminescent oligonucleotide probes. A hybridization protection assay (HPA) that uses acridinium ester (AE) labeled oligonucleotide probes which are specific for a conserved gag gene region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was developed to measure the amount of HIV-1 nucleic acid. Hybridization of the single-stranded probes with their target HIV-1 sequences protected the chemiluminescent AE group from subsequent alkaline hydrolysis. The chemiluminescence from the residual AE could be easily quantitated in a luminometer. The entire process comprising template dissociation, hybridization, alkaline hydrolysis, and chemiluminescence measurement can be completed in less than one hour and does not require the separation of hybridized probe from unhybridized probe. We demonstrated that HPA could quantitatively measure the amount of DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction. A comparative study using amplified DNA from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HIV seropositive and seronegative persons showed that HPA was as sensitive as the previous methods using 32P-labeled DNA probes.",Virus_Diseases
"A retrospective analysis of therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease: initial treatment. We have reviewed results of therapy in 740 patients with grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic marrow transplantation. At the beginning of therapy, 597 patients (81%) had rash, 369 (50%) had liver dysfunction and 396 (54%) had gut dysfunction. Initial treatment was with glucocorticoids (n = 531), cyclosporine (n = 170), antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (n = 156) or monoclonal antibody (n = 3) either singly (n = 633) or in combination (n = 107). Parameters of GVHD severity in each organ were recorded weekly, and evaluation of response was made using values at the initiation of secondary treatment or, for patients without such treatment, using values on day 29 of primary treatment or the last recorded value before death, whichever occurred first. Minimal criteria for improvement or progression were defined for each organ, but no attempt was made to define liver or gut outcome if another complication such as venocclusive disease or infectious enteritis was present. Improvement rates were 43% for skin disease, 35% for evaluable liver disease and 50% for evaluable gut disease. Overall complete or partial responses were seen in 44% of patients. Multivariate analyses were carried out to identify patient, disease or treatment factors associated with likelihood of overall improvement and likelihood of response in at least one organ. A similar analysis was also carried out to identify covariates associated with time to treatment failure (defined as initiation of secondary therapy or death not due to relapse of malignancy). In all three models, GVHD prophylaxis using cyclosporine combined with methotrexate was associated with favorable GVHD treatment outcome compared to prophylaxis with either agent alone, and treatment with glucocorticoids or cyclosporine was more successful than treatment with ATG. Other factors associated with unfavorable outcome in the model of time to treatment failure and also entered in one of the response models were recipient HLA disparity with the donor, presence of a liver complication other than GVHD, and early onset of GVHD. Results of this analysis indicate that glucocorticoids represent the best initial therapy available for treatment of acute GVHD, although much room for improvement remains.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Detection of Coxsackievirus B3 RNA in myocardial tissues by the polymerase chain reaction. Coxsackievirus B3 is a possible etiologic agent in some forms of myocarditis and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. A method for the detection of coxsackievirus B3 RNA was developed using the polymerase chain reaction based on the amplification of a cDNA copy of the positive-strand viral RNA. The fidelity of the method was established in two murine models for coxsackie B3 myocarditis. All cardiac specimens with adequate RNA for study from coxsackie B3-infected mice contained detectable viral RNA, in contrast to none of control specimens from noninfected mice. The sensitivity of the technique was established at approximately 1 to 100 plaque-forming units of virus per gram of tissue, and the specificity was established as limited to the coxsackievirus B3 serotype among nine viruses tested. In patients with myocarditis, one of five specimens contained detectable viral RNA, whereas none of 11 specimens from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or 21 myocardial specimens from patients with a wide variety of other cardiac disorders contained detectable coxsackie B3 viral RNA. The results show that the polymerase chain reaction is a useful means for detecting coxsackie viral RNA and its application should help in the evaluation of hypotheses concerning the infectious etiology of human myocarditis and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.",Virus_Diseases
"Quantitative estimation of hair growth. I. androgenetic alopecia in women: effect of minoxidil. Quantitative growth of hair over a 40-week period is reported for eight women with androgenetic alopecia. Using a random, double-blind protocol, the women were given either a 2% minoxidil solution or a placebo of vehicle only. Hair in a permanently marked site on the fronto-parietal scalp was pulled through a 1-cm-square clear plastic template, and the outline of the template was drawn on the scalp. The hair was carefully hand clipped and collected at five eight-week intervals (one untreated and four treated), using great care to collect only hairs within the marked area. Subsequent measurements included the total weight of hair grown in the marked area, the total number of hairs, and, on a randomized 50-hair subsample, the weight, lengths, and optical diameters. Calculated quantities included average weight per hair, average length, and average optical width. The average total hair weight of minoxidil-treated subjects increased over the 32-week test period by 42.5%, compared to 1.9% for the placebo-treated subjects (average p = 0.018). Changes for the average number count were 29.9% and -2.6%, respectively (average p = 0.022). These increases, observed using an unusually small number of subjects, clearly distinguished the treated subjects from the untreated. During the same test period, the averaged quantities of weight, diameter, and length from the 50-hair subsample showed insignificant change (p usually greater than 0.5). In addition to showing a larger percentage increase than did the total number, the total weight is not only easier to obtain, but less prone to error during sampling and measurement. Therefore, we recommend that total weight from a defined area be considered as the primary quantitative estimator for hair growth.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

From January 1986 to December 1987, 596 children less than 5 years of age with lower respiratory tract infection (LRI)--manifested as laryngitis, croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia--were studied for evidence of infection with respiratory tract viruses Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Of the 596 children in the study, 315 were ambulatory and 281 were hospitalized. Virologic studies included isolation and rapid diagnosis of virus from specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and serologic studies of blood samples. Cultures of NPA for C. trachomatis were performed for children less than 6 months of age who had pneumonia. Of the LRI cases, 45% were associated with viral infections of the respiratory tract and 12.1% were associated with C. trachomatis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounted for 45.2% of infections with viral agents and was associated with acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Parainfluenza type 3 virus was the most common virus found in conjunction with laryngitis and croup.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether quantitative motor unit analysis in postpolio individuals correlates with muscle strength, endurance, work capacity, or power spectral characteristics of surface EMG and to determine whether power spectrum differentiates postpolio from control subjects. This study was designed to compare these variables in 34 symptomatic postpolio, 16 asymptomatic postpolio, and 41 control subjects. Quantitative motor unit analysis of the quadriceps femoris muscle was performed using a concentric needle electrode. Isometric knee extension peak torque, endurance (time to exhaustion) at 40% of maximal torque, work capacity (tension time index), and recovery of force through 10 minutes post-exhaustion were determined. Median frequency of the surface power spectrum was determined during the above testing. Power spectrum histograms were compared at the onset and termination of endurance exercise.

The lips of 196 patients with a history of sun-induced herpes labialis were exposed to experimental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and treated with acyclovir (ACV) or placebo at different times and by different routes. Of 98 placebo recipients, 39 (40%) developed 43 lesions inside or within 10 mm of the irradiated zone. The temporal distribution of lesions was bimodal. 11 (26%) occurring within 48 h (immediate) and 32 (72%) 2-7 days after UVR exposure (delayed). Prophylactic peroral ACV begun 7 days before or 5 min after UVR prevented the development of the delayed but not the immediate lesions (P less than .001). When peroral ACV was started 48 h after UVR, delayed lesions developed but were less severe (P = .01-.05). Prophylactic topical ACV begun 5 min after UVR did not reduce lesion frequency or severity. ACV therapy can be efficacious, but some rapidly developing lesions are unresponsive to treatment.

MCT cells are distributed primarily in the lung and gastrointestinal mucosa, whereas MCTC cells lie primarily in skin and gastrointestinal submucosa. The appearance of MCT cells in intestinal tissue is T-lymphocyte dependent, whereas MCTC cells is not.

Twenty-nine percent (5/17) of the patients with anti-HCV-related cirrhosis presented with hepatocellular carcinoma. None of the patients with noncirrhotic liver disease had a primary liver tumor. We conclude that a significant number of patients in suburban America with chronic hepatitis C have no identifiable risk factors for HCV. Sporadic transmission of hepatitis C may play an important role in patients with chronic HCV-related liver disease, especially among patients born and raised outside North America.",Virus_Diseases
"Five year prospective study of HIV infection in the Edinburgh haemophiliac cohort  OBJECTIVE--To identify measures of immune state that reflect the course of HIV related disease in order to predict deterioration of symptoms and assess response to treatment. DESIGN--Five year longitudinal clinical and laboratory study. SETTING--Regional haemophilia centre, university virology laboratory, and Medical Research Council laboratory. PATIENTS--32 Patients with haemophilia A exposed to a single batch of HIV contaminated factor VIII concentrate from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service in 1984 who were followed up regularly in Edinburgh (31) or abroad (one). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Counts of circulating T cell subsets (CD4 and CD8); plasma beta 2 microglobulin, neopterin, and IgA concentrations; and delayed type hypersensitivity to multiple skin test antigens. RESULTS--18 Patients who seroconverted after exposure had received significantly more contaminated factor VIII than the 14 who did not (mean 43 (range 9-109) v 15 (3-30) phials, p less than 0.01). The two groups were not distinguishable by other criteria before exposure. The group that seroconverted subsequently showed a progressive fall in mean circulating CD4 lymphocytes and an increase in plasma beta 2 microglobulin and neopterin concentrations. From 1987 patients in this group also showed an increase in mean circulating CD8 lymphocytes and in plasma IgA concentration, neither of which was seen in patients who did not seroconvert. Patients with HIV antibody who developed Centers for Disease Control category IV symptoms within five years after infection showed more extreme changes in all measures, except CD8 lymphocyte count, than those whose symptoms remained in categories II and III. Skin test reactivity declined to barely detectable levels in all patients positive for HIV antibody. CONCLUSIONS--Serial estimates of circulating CD4 lymphocytes and of plasma beta 2 microglobulin concentration are the most reliable measures of disease progression; of these, beta 2 microglobulin concentration seems to be the better predictor of impending serious symptoms. High IgA concentrations reflect rather than predict disease state. Individual variation in most measures is such that a wide range of measurements should be used in assessing the effects of trial treatment in HIV infected patients without symptoms.",Virus_Diseases
"Multidisciplinary baseline assessment of homosexual men with and without human immunodeficiency virus infection. II. Standardized clinical assessment of current and lifetime psychopathology. Despite numerous reports of the psychiatric consequences of human immunodeficiency virus infection, few reports describe systematic diagnostic assessments of people with human immunodeficiency virus infection. We studied the results of standardized clinical assessments of current and lifetime psychopathology in a large group of homosexual men whose serologic status was known. Results indicated low rates of current mental disorders but very high rates of lifetime major depression and alcohol and other psychoactive substance abuse and dependence disorders. Measures of severity of psychopathology and functioning also indicated, on the whole, good current functioning. No significant relationship was found between stage of medical illness or immune status and any measure of psychiatric disturbance.",Virus_Diseases
"A quantitative structure activity/dose response relationship for contact allergic potential of alkyl group transfer agents. As part of the investigation of structure activity relationships in contact allergy, it has been shown that methyl transfer agents are capable of acting as skin sensitizers. This work has now been extended to a more general examination of alkyl transfer reactions. The modified single injection adjuvant test has been used to investigate the sensitization potential of C12, C16 and unsaturated C18 alkyl transfer agents. Dose responses to challenge and the patterns of cross-reactivity between these materials and methyl transfer agents have been studied. All alkyl transfer agents examined were potent sensitizers in the guinea pig. There was evidence of mutual cross-reactivity between all alkyl transfer agents examined (including methyl transfer agents). Analysis of the data in terms of a modified relative alkylation index showed evidence of an overload effect. The sensitization data has been accurately modelled using a mathematical equation. These results emphasize the possibilities for relating physicochemical parameters and skin sensitization potential. Further studies with alkyl transfer agents are in progress of amplify the observations and conclusions presented in this report. No in vitro model is available for the prediction of skin sensitization potential. Therefore an approach based on a model using physicochemical criteria is the most likely route to a reduced requirement for animal testing.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Increased epidermal growth factor receptors in seborrheic keratoses and acrochordons of patients with the dysplastic nevus syndrome. Seborrheic keratoses and acrochordons may change in biologic behavior with pregnancy or during treatment with sex steroids. Because epidermal growth factor receptor localization may change in hyperproliferative skin diseases, we compared epidermal growth factor receptor immunolocalization in seborrheic keratoses and acrochordons from women who were or were not pregnant or taking oral sex steroid hormones. Epidermal growth factor receptor was further investigated in growing and quiescent seborrheic keratoses and acrochordons from women with and without the dysplastic nevus syndrome. The epidermal growth factor receptor concentration was strikingly elevated in suprabasilar keratinocytes of growing seborrheic keratoses and acrochordons from patients with the dysplastic nevus syndrome who were pregnant or taking sex steroid hormones and less elevated in growing seborrheic keratoses from other patients. In contrast, the epidermal growth factor receptor distribution pattern in acrochordons did not correlate as well with the history of growth of these lesions in normal patients. These data suggest sex steroids may affect epidermal growth factor receptor metabolism in benign epidermal hyperproliferative lesions, particularly in patients with the dysplastic nevus syndrome.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

One hundred eight patients were treated for 8 weeks. At the end of this time the median number of papules in the metronidazole-treated group was reduced to 8% of the initial number, and the median number in the group treated with tetracycline was reduced to 0% of the initial number.

"Effect of retinoic acid on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) bioactivity and type-B PDGF receptors in normal and psoriatic human fibroblasts. Psoriasis is a common skin disease in which retinoids have beneficial effects. It offers a model for the study of benign hyperproliferation with abnormal differentiation. The dermis has a prominent role in the appearance of epidermal lesions. It is therefore of interest to study the factors that modulate dermal cell proliferation. In this study, the role of retinoids in modulating platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) bioactivity was studied in normal (six subjects) and psoriatic fibroblasts from involved and uninvolved tissues (six patients). Retinoic acid treatment (for 4 d at 10(-6) M) of psoriatic fibroblasts significantly increased the chemotactic effect of PDGF in these cells (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively, in involved and uninvolved skin at 20 ng/ml of platelet-derived growth factor as measured in a modified Boyden Chamber Assay). In the same way, retinoic acid treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts increased the mitogenicity of platelet-derived growth factor in these cells. Retinoic acid treatment has no significant effect on the mitogenic and chemotactic activity of PDGF in normal fibroblasts. The binding of the homodimer BB PDGF to its type-B receptor, which mediates the mitogenic and chemotactic effect of PDGF, was not modified by retinoic acid treatment either in psoriatic and/or normal fibroblasts. These results suggest that retinoic acid may modulate the PDGF bioactivity in psoriatic fibroblasts not by affecting the binding of this ligand to these cells but by influencing a post-receptor event.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Short-term changes in renal function, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels in patients receiving cyclosporine for dermatologic disorders. We compared the changes in renal function, blood pressure (BP), and concentrations of serum potassium, magnesium, and urate (uric acid) in two groups of patients not given transplants. Group 1, comprising 21 psoriatic patients, was treated with 14 mg/kg per day of oral cyclosporine for 4 weeks in a prospective, placebo-controlled study; group 2, comprising 28 patients with diverse cutaneous diseases, was given 6 mg/kg per day of oral cyclosporine for 1 to 3 months in a prospective, open-labeled study. Renal function (determined by serum urea nitrogen [SUN] and creatinine levels and urinalysis), BP, serum electrolyte levels (potassium and magnesium), and urate level were measured weekly for the first 4 weeks in both groups, and then, after 2 and 3 months of therapy, in group 2 only. During the first 4 weeks in group 1 patients, there were significant increases in values of SUN, creatinine, BP, potassium, and urate, and a significant decrease in the serum magnesium value. When data for the two groups were combined, the changes from pretherapy values in each of the above measures (except systolic BP) during the first 4 weeks correlated significantly with cyclosporine trough levels. In group 2, the changes that occurred in the first 4 weeks in the SUN value, SUN/creatinine ratio, and BP were magnified over the subsequent 8 weeks of treatment. In the combined group for the first 4 weeks of therapy, duration of therapy, independent of cyclosporine trough levels, correlated with changes in SUN, creatinine, and urate levels, but not with changes in the potassium or magnesium level or in BP. We conclude that the cyclosporine blood level was a better discriminant than cyclosporine dosage in the analysis of renal dysfunction and hypertension in these patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"The risk of development of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis among persons infected with HTLV-I. Using data obtained in national surveys of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) conducted in Japan in 1987 and 1988, we estimated the yearly and lifetime risk that HAM/TSP will develop in an HTLV-I-infected person. ""Definite"" HAM/TSP was defined as slowly progressive myelopathy with antibodies to HTLV-I in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Estimates of HTLV-I infection rates in eight endemic prefectures, by age group and sex, were obtained from serologic studies of blood donors; population figures, by age group, sex, and prefecture, were obtained from the census. Of 589 definite cases of HAM/TSP reported nationally, 397 occurred in residents of the eight endemic prefectures; of these, 170 reported onset of illness during the years 1982-1988 (average incidence, 24.3 cases/year). Using the estimated HTLV-I infection rates and the 1985 census figures, we estimated the number of HTLV-I-infected persons in the eight prefectures in 1985 at 794,800. We therefore estimated the incidence of HAM/TSP among HTLV-I-infected persons at 3.1 x 10(-5) cases/year; assuming a lifetime of 75 years, the lifetime incidence is approximately one quarter of 1%. This estimate is important in counseling persons such as blood donors found to be infected with HTLV-I.",Virus_Diseases

"Intestinal mucosal permeability in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. II. Role of disease. Gut permeability as measured by the 51Cr-EDTA resorption test was determined in 56 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 73 patients with spondyloarthropathies (SpA), 18 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 97 controls (42 patients with no inflammatory rheumatic diseases and 55 healthy controls). Gut permeability was found to be increased in the 3 patient groups, partially due to the intake of antiinflammatory drugs. When only patients not taking these drugs were considered, an increased gut permeability was found in patients with SpA and IBD. In patients with RA gut permeability could not be evaluated as they were all taking antiinflammatory medication. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsies of the gut was performed in 62 of the 73 patients with SpA and disclosed subclinical gut inflammation in 21. No difference in gut permeability was found between patients with or without gut inflammation. However, when the type of gut inflammation was considered, a significant increase of gut permeability was found in patients with chronic gut inflammation compared with patients presenting acute lesions. Our findings again suggest that the chronic gut inflammation seen in SpA is fundamentally different from acute gut inflammation and possibly related to the gut inflammation of IBD.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Acute sensorineural deafness in Lassa fever  A prospective audiometric evaluation of 69 hospitalized febrile patients in Sierra Leone, West Africa, revealed a sensorineural hearing deficit (SNHD) in 14 (29%) of 49 confirmed cases of Lassa fever and in 0 of 20 febrile controls. An SNHD was present in nine (17.6%) of 51 people who had evidence of previous Lassa virus infection. Twenty-six of 32 local residents who had previously sustained a sudden deafness had antibody titers to Lassa virus of 16 or greater, compared with six of 32 matched controls. Lassa fever is associated with an incidence of SNHD, which considerably exceeds that previously reported with any other postnatally acquired infection, and accounts for a prevalence of virus-related hearing impairment in the eastern province of Sierra Leone that is greater than that reported from anywhere else in the world.",Virus_Diseases

"Unexplained rabies in three immigrants in the United States. A virologic investigation  BACKGROUND. Extensive investigation of three patients who died of rabies in the United States failed to reveal any source of exposure to the disease. The three patients had immigrated to the United States from areas in Laos, the Philippines, and Mexico where rabies is endemic. METHODS. We studied rabies viruses isolated from the three patients, other patients with a known source of exposure, and animals in the United States, Thailand (as a proxy for Laos), the Philippines, and Mexico. The viruses were characterized by indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization tests according to their reactions to panels of monoclonal antibodies. Transcribed complementary DNA from these isolates was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction; the DNA product was then analyzed by differential digestion with restriction enzymes. RESULTS. The viral isolate from each of the three patients was a rabies variant with distinctive antigenic or genetic characteristics. For each of the three isolates, identical variants were found in specimens from rabid animals obtained from or near the country in which the patient lived before immigrating to the United States. None of these variants were found among the isolates collected from rabid animals in the United States. CONCLUSIONS. Rabies infection in these three patients did not originate in the United States but resulted from exposures in Laos, the Philippines, and Mexico. Since the three patients had lived in the United States for 4 years, 6 years, and 11 months, our findings suggest that the onset of the clinical manifestations of rabies occurred after long incubation periods.",Virus_Diseases
"Survival differences in patients with AIDS [published erratum appears in J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 1991;4(7):737] To define the clinical, demographic, and behavioral variables that may influence survival in patients with AIDS, we studied 526 patients with AIDS diagnosed through September 1987 who were cared for at a single medical center. A diversity of racial and ethnic backgrounds, ages, both men and women, and all risk behaviors except hemophilia were well represented. The initial AIDS defining diagnosis was the most powerful predictor of survival. The median survival was 12.8 months for patients presenting with Kaposi's sarcoma (p less than 0.001), 10.9 months for patients presenting with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (p less than 0.001), and 4.8 months for patients presenting with other infections or neoplasms (p less than 0.02). For the entire series, male sex and younger age were associated with more favorable survival (p less than 0.025). For those presenting with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, in addition to younger age (p less than 0.025), black race (p less than 0.025) and the combination of male sex and intravenous drug use (p less than 0.005) were associated with a more favorable survival. Within a setting of comparable clinical care, survival from the point of diagnosis of AIDS is associated most strongly with the initial AIDS diagnosis, but differences in age, gender, race, and risk behavior also exert an influence on survival.",Virus_Diseases

Patellofemoral compressive force was measured before and after anterior displacement of the tibial tuberosity for patellofemoral disorders on 30 knees in 28 patients. All patients selected for this experiment were those who obtained relief of pain in the activities of daily living. Twenty-five women and three men, with an average age of 54 years (range, 21-79 years), were followed an average of 38 months (range, 24-84 months). The maximum strength of knee extension was measured by a myodynamometer with the knee at 45 degrees flexion. Patellofemoral compressive force was calculated using a vector of quadriceps muscle power. At the final follow-up evaluation, the quadriceps lever arm increased in all knees with an average rate of increase of 20% +/- 2%. The maximum strength of knee extension increased in all but three knees with an average rate of increase of 147% +/- 27%.

"Viral persistence in neurons explained by lack of major histocompatibility class I expression. Viruses frequently persist in neurons, suggesting that these cells can evade immune surveillance. In a mouse model, 5 x 10(6) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), did not lyse infected neurons or cause immunopathologic injury. In contrast, intracerebral injection of less than 10(3) CTL caused disease and death when viral antigens were expressed on leptomeningeal and choroid plexus cells of the nervous system. The neuronal cell line OBL21 expresses little or no major histocompatibility (MHC) class I surface glycoproteins and when infected with LCMV, resisted lysis by virus-specific CTLs. Expression of MHC heavy chain messenger RNA was limited, but beta 2-microglobulin messenger RNA and protein was made normally. OBL21 cells were made sensitive to CTL lysis by transfection with a fusion gene encoding another MHC class I molecule. Hence, neuronal cells probably evade immune surveillance by failing to express MHC class I molecules.",Virus_Diseases
"Human papillomavirus DNA sequences in cell lines derived from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. There is increasing evidence that human papillomaviruses (HPV) have a casual role in some neoplasms in human beings. As examples, DNA of HPV types 16, 18, and 31 are frequently present in genital cancers in humans. Recently, oncogenic HPV types have also been identified in neoplasms of the head and neck, including verrucous carcinoma of the larynx, squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and larynx, and inverted papillomas of the nose. These findings and our resource of an extensive panel of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines led us to begin to investigate how frequently HPV DNA was present in these tumor cell lines. For initial analysis, twenty-two HNSCC cell lines derived from 20 patients' tumors were selected as representative of our tumor cell line panel with respect to diversity of primary site, tumor stage, patient age, sex, and clinical course. For Southern analysis, cell line DNA was tested for hybridization with DNA probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 31. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was also performed on five tumor cell lines using types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 52 as probes. Southern blot analysis revealed HPV-specific signals in two of the 22 HNSCC cell lines tested. One of these, UM-SCC-23, was HPV 31 positive, which to our knowledge is the first identification of HPV 31 in HNSCC.

"Association of cervical ectopy with heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus: results of a study of couples in Nairobi, Kenya. To identify risk factors involved in heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a cross-sectional study of HIV-seropositive men and their spouses was conducted in Nairobi, Kenya. Of 70 spouses, 40 (57%) were seropositive and 30 (43%) were seronegative for HIV. In univariate analysis, the presence of cervical ectopy (odds ratio, 4.7; P = .006) was the only statistically significant variable associated with HIV infection in women. After controlling for possible confounding variables using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of cervical ectopy (odds ratio, 5.0; P = .007) remained the only independent predictor of HIV seropositivity. These findings suggest that cervical ectopy may be a newly identified risk factor for heterosexual transmission of HIV.",Virus_Diseases
"Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in children. The symptoms, findings, associated conditions, and treatment of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus were studied in 10 girls and one boy. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a benign but chronic condition of the anogenital area of girls and, less frequently, of boys. The characteristic lesions are hypo-pigmented plaques in a figure-of-8 pattern surrounding the vulva and anus and often involving the natal cleft. The affected hypopigmented skin is sharply demarcated from the normal skin. Hemorrhagic, bullous lesions are uncommon. Fissures and ulcers are seen on the labia, between the labia, and on the perineum, anus, and natal cleft in many children and on the glans penis in boys. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus causes painful defecation and anal and vulval bleeding. In two patients, one girl and one boy, anal stenosis due to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and laxative treatment developed.

"Changing disease patterns in patients with AIDS in a referral centre in the United Kingdom: the changing face of AIDS  OBJECTIVE--To study the changes in morbidity, mortality, and survival patterns in a population of patients with AIDS in the United Kingdom from 1982 to 1989. DESIGN--A retrospective analysis of inpatient and outpatient records of patients with AIDS. SUBJECTS--347 Patients with AIDS, predominantly homosexual or bisexual men. SETTING--Departments of immunology and genitourinary medicine, St Mary's Hospital, London. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presenting diagnosis of AIDS, occurrence of other opportunist diseases, cause of death, and survival since AIDS was diagnosed, in particular for those patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or Kaposi's sarcoma. RESULTS--The overall proportion of patients who developed P carinii pneumonia dropped from 56% (20/36) in 1984 to 24% (46/194) in 1989, although it has remained the index diagnosis in about half of new patients. Kaposi's sarcoma has decreased as index diagnosis from 30% (20/67) to 20% (15/74) over the same period, though the prevalence has remained constant at around 35%. P carinii pneumonia accounted for 46% (16/35) of known causes of death in 1986 but only 3% (1/31) in 1989. Conversely, deaths due to Kaposi's sarcoma rose from 14% (1/7) to 32% (10/31) between 1984 and 1989. Lymphoma accounted for an increased proportion of deaths among these patients with 16% (5/31) of deaths in 1989. Their median survival increased from 10 months in 1984-6 to 20 months in 1987. CONCLUSIONS--The changing patterns of disease in patients with AIDS have important implications both for health care provision and future medical research. Medical and nursing provision must be made for the increased morbidity of these diseases and the increased survival of these patients. Research should now be directed towards developing effective treatments for the opportunist infections which are currently more difficult to treat, the secondary malignancies of AIDS, as well as more effective immunorestorative treatments.

"Cyclosporine A metabolism by cytochrome P-450III occurs in microsomes from rat liver but not from normal epidermis or psoriatic lesions. Cyclosporine A is efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis when taken orally or injected intralesionally but not topically. Lack of penetration to necessary locations or rapid metabolism during passage through the epidermis may account for the ineffectiveness. Cytochromes P-450III in the liver are known to be involved in cyclosporine metabolism and inactivation. This study was undertaken to determine if an epidermal cytochrome P-450III exists that can inactivate topical cyclosporine A. Rats were treated with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin to induce the cytochrome P-450III family of enzymes. Microsomal fractions were prepared from liver and epidermis of rats and from lesional areas of psoriasis patients. NADPH cytochrome C reductase activity was determined as a positive control for microsomal enzymatic activity. Formation of metabolite 1, the predominant metabolite of cyclosporine A, by liver microsomes was increased 193% after 10 d erythromycin treatment. The cytochrome P-450 dependent activity in microsomes from the epidermis of control and erythromycin-treated rats and in microsomes from psoriatic tissue was at the detection limits of the assay system. Cytochrome P-450III gene family mRNA were detectable by polymerase chain reaction in liver but not in psoriatic or normal epidermis. The lack of detectable P-450III mRNA and the absence or minimal conversion of cyclosporine A to inactive metabolites by epidermal microsomes suggest that the ineffectiveness of topical cyclosporine A in psoriasis may not be due to inactivation of cyclosporine A by cytochrome P-450 in the skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

It is concluded that HPV 6/11 cannot proliferate at nongenital cutaneous sites and HPV 2 can proliferate in the genital tract of children but not adults. Thus, the detection of HPV 6 or 11 in a genital wart in a child implies, assuming cutaneous transmission, infection from a genital site, whereas the detection of HPV 2 presumes nongenital transmission.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Autoantibodies against CD4 cells are associated with CD4 helper defects in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. To investigate whether autoantibodies against CD4-positive lymphocytes might induce helper dysfunction, autoantibody formation and T-cell function was examined simultaneously in 61 hemophilia patients. Twenty patients were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative, 26 HIV-positive stage CDC II or III, and 15 were HIV-positive stage CDC IV. T lymphocytes, CD4-positive, or CD8-positive T subsets were cocultured with B lymphocytes and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) for 6 days and Ig-secreting cells were assessed in a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. The presence of IgM, IgG, C3d, or gp120 on the surface of T cells or T subsets was analyzed by flow cytometry. Autoantibodies against CD4-positive T cells were not detected in controls or HIV-negative patients, but were common in HIV-positive patients (20 of 41 patients). In patients with autoantibodies we found an increased incidence of CD4 helper defects (P less than .0001 in CDC II or III patients; P less than .02 in CDC IV patients). 12 of 13 patients with IgM autoantibodies and 4 of 4 with IgG autoantibodies showed CD4 helper defects. Complement fixation had no relevance. Autoantibody formation against CD4 cells was not due to increased in vivo B-cell stimulation (spontaneous plaque formation: 611 +/- 204 PFC/10(6) B cells in autoantibody-negative patients v 650 +/- 202 PFC/10(6) B cells in autoantibody-positive patients; not significant). Thus, our results suggest that autoantibody formation is not caused by a general state of in vivo B-cell activation. Rather, the production of autoantibodies appears to coincide with defects in B-cell proliferation or differentiation, as shown by reduced mitogen-stimulated B-cell responses in CDC II and III patients (P less than .05). Autoantibodies against CD4 cells appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of CD4 helper defects of HIV-infected patients.",Virus_Diseases
Grafting of venous leg ulcers. An intraindividual comparison between cultured skin equivalents and full-thickness skin punch grafts. Skin equivalents that consisted of a noncontracted collagen gel populated with allogeneic fibroblasts and covered with autologous cultured keratinocytes were used for grafting venous leg ulcers. The results were compared in the same patient with those obtained with a routinely used standard method of grafting with autologous full-thickness punch grafts. The skin equivalents and the punch grafts were grafted successfully in four of five patients. The median healing time of ulcers grafted with skin equivalents was 18 days whereas that of ulcers covered with punch grafts was 15 days. The cosmetic appearance of the skin equivalent-grafted ulcers was better than that of the punch-grafted ulcers.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone in infections with respiratory syncytial virus. The association between infections with respiratory syncytial virus and plasma concentrations of antidiuretic hormone was assessed in 48 patients who had been admitted to hospital. The mean (SEM) concentration of antidiuretic hormone was significantly raised in patients with bronchiolitis (9.3 (1.4) ng/l) compared with non-pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus infections that cause apnoea or upper respiratory tract symptoms (6.1 (1.7) ng/l). The highest concentrations of antidiuretic hormone were seen in patients receiving mechanical ventilation (18.0 (6.7) ng/l). There were no differences in mean serum sodium concentrations among the subgroups. Hypertranslucency on chest radiograph or an arterial carbon dioxide tension above 6.67 kPa were associated with a significantly higher concentration of antidiuretic hormone. Increased or normal maintenance fluid intake in children with pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus infections may cause the same symptoms of fluid overload as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Patients with pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus infection, hypertranslucency in chest radiograph, hypercapnia, or mechanical ventilation are at risk for raised concentrations of antidiuretic hormone. Restricted fluid intake and careful monitoring of fluid balance and plasma electrolyte concentrations are therefore necessary in these patients.",Virus_Diseases
"Endoscopic re-establishment of membranous urethral disruption. A total of 17 patients with traumatic membranous urethral disruption underwent urethral reconstruction via a core-through technique. Followup was 1 to 8 years (mean 3.7 years) postoperatively, and included 6 weeks with an indwelling catheter, periodic dilation for 6 months and occasional sounding. Within 1 year postoperatively, 6 patients required additional scar incision, including 3 who underwent scar resection. At 1 to 8 years postoperatively 6 patients had complications: 3 had stricture requiring periodic dilation (including 2 who underwent scar incision), while 2 had mild stress incontinence and 1 had nocturnal enuresis. Traumatic impotence was noted in 7 patients but the operation was not the cause in any. This method of endoscopic management was found to be an acceptable alternative to urethroplasty in cases of membranous urethral disruption.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Functional studies of soluble low-affinity interleukin-2 receptors in rheumatoid synovial fluid. Since abnormal regulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been demonstrated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the functional role of low-affinity soluble IL-2 receptors (sIL-2R) purified from RA synovial fluids (SF) was studied. Picomolar levels of sIL-2R were detected in RA SF using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels were higher in serum and SF from RA patients than in controls (P less than 0.001) and higher in RA SF than in paired RA serum (P less than 0.01). Soluble IL-2R from RA SF had estimated molecular weights of 40-50 kd and 80-100 kd by gel filtration analysis. The 80-100-kd peak is likely to be a dimer of the 40-50-kd peak, since a single 45-kd peak was found after elution from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Since inhibitory activity for lymphocyte proliferation was found in the 80-100-kd range, the sIL-2R were purified with an anti-CD25 affinity column and further analyzed. The purified fractions did not interfere with the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes or with the binding of radiolabeled IL-2 to CTLL-2 cells, although direct binding of IL-2 was demonstrated. The affinity of sIL-2R from RA SF for binding IL-2 was in the range of 25 nM, which is similar to the affinity of sIL-2R purified from a human T cell clone, indicating that both sIL-2R are low-affinity receptors for IL-2. We conclude that the concentration and binding affinity of low-affinity sIL-2R purified from RA SF render them unable to interfere with IL-2-related activities.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Flexion osteotomy of the femur for genu recurvatum after poliomyelitis. We report the results of 21 femoral osteotomies performed in 18 patients for genu recurvatum and flattening of the femoral condyles after poliomyelitis. Before operation the average angle of recurvatum was 31 degrees and all the limbs required bracing. After a mean follow-up of four years there has been partial recurrence in only one case. Nine patients (10 limbs) needed no orthosis and the others had less discomfort and an improved gait. Complete remodelling of the femoral and tibial epiphyses was noted in two of the younger patients.,Virus_Diseases
"Allergic and reactive dermatoses. How to identify and treat them [published erratum appears in Postgrad Med 1991 Aug;90(2):54] The epidermis, as the body's first line of defense against many pathogens, reacts in a variety of ways to the assault of foreign antigens. Allergic contact dermatitis, drug eruption, urticaria, and erythema multiforme are examples. The clinician must usually rely on clinical evidence for diagnosis. The first therapeutic strategy is to identify and avoid the antigen or drug causing the reaction. Beyond this, therapy consists of relief of symptoms in mild to moderate cases. In severe cases, systemic treatment can be helpful, but the therapeutic options and their efficacy are limited.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Anti-(U1) small nuclear RNA antibodies in anti-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein sera from patients with connective tissue diseases. Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles are a class of RNA-containing particles in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Sera from patients with connective tissue diseases often contain antibodies against the proteins present in these snRNPs. Antibodies against the RNA components of snRNPs, the U snRNAs, are thought to be rare. We tested 118 anti-snRNP sera for the presence of anti-snRNA antibodies and found them in 45 sera (38%). In all sera the antibodies (IgG and F(ab)2 fragments thereof) were exclusively directed against U1 snRNA. The anti-(U1) RNA antibodies were always accompanied by anti-(U1)RNP antibodies but were not found in sera which contain antibodies of the Sm serotype directed against all nucleoplasmic U snRNP particles. Like anti-RNP antibodies, anti-U1 RNA activity is confined to sera from patients with SLE or SLE overlap syndromes and is rarely found in patients with other connective tissue diseases. By analyzing binding to subfragments of U1 snRNA made in vitro, it was demonstrated that anti-(U1)RNA antibodies recognize epitopes distributed throughout the U1 RNA molecule. In most sera, however, either the second or the fourth hairpin loop is the main target of the antibody. The possible mechanisms that could lead to the production of this new type of autoantibody are discussed.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A possible role for transforming growth factor-beta in systemic sclerosis. The cause of systemic sclerosis remains unknown, but cellular and molecular mechanisms possibly responsible for the characteristic clinical manifestations of fibrosis and vascular damage (Raynaud's phenomenon, telangiectasis, digital infection, and renal arteriopathy) are becoming understood in greater detail. One possibly important cytokine is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta); its involvement is reviewed here. With regard to vascular lesions, TGF-beta has variably been shown to inhibit endothelial cell growth in vitro but to promote angiogenesis in vivo, a paradox that remains unresolved. Nonetheless, an injurious activity of TGF-beta on microvascular endothelial cells could help to explain the intimal proliferation and microvascular obliteration seen. Whether as a result of or as a cause of endothelial cell damage, platelet activation has been well documented in systemic sclerosis and the platelet alpha granule pool contains a large quantity of TGF-beta. TGF-beta is also produced by activated macrophages and T cells, both of which are known to occur within systemic sclerosis lesions. An important effect of TGF-beta is its stimulation of fibroblast collagen and fibronectin synthesis and their deposition into the extracellular matrix. Stimulation by TGF-beta may therefore account for the fibrosis seen in the dermis and in the internal organs. Direct evidence of TGF-beta involvement in systemic sclerosis is scanty, and awaits discovery of either an abnormal expression of or response to TGF-beta. The biologic effects of TGF-beta appear to be regulated at the level of activation from a latent polypeptide precursor form. Descriptions of the importance of this cytokine in pathologic conditions will need to account for this activation and its regulation. Nonetheless, the physiologic effects so far attributed to TGF-beta make its involvement in systemic sclerosis an attractive possibility to explain some of the manifestations of this enigmatic disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Intravital detection of skin capillary aneurysms by videomicroscopy with indocyanine green in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis and related disorders. Conventional capillaroscopy and infrared fluorescence videomicroscopy with indocyanine green were performed at the nailfold in 12 healthy controls and 38 patients with microangiopathy due to systemic sclerosis or related disorders. Saccular aneurysms featuring head and neck (type 1) and aneurysmatic enlargements (type 2) were defined. Microaneurysms were located at the apex or near the apex of capillary loops and were significantly more common in patients than in controls (p less than 0.02 for type 1 and p less than 0.001 for type 2). Combination of the two lesions was found only in patients and appears to be a valuable new diagnostic sign for the presence of microangiopathy. In comparison with conventional capillaroscopy, about twice as many microaneurysms were detected by videomicroscopy with indocyanine green coupling almost completely to plasma proteins.

Reductions in the frequency, duration and severity of attacks while taking T3 were gradual but highly significant. Four of 6 subjects had skin ulcer healing. Skin temperatures in the hands increased significantly. The skin temperature recovery times after cold exposure were significantly shorter during T3 therapy compared with placebo. Although large dosages of T3 were well tolerated, 6 patients experienced episodic palpitations, and slight but significant increases in heart rate and pulse pressure were observed.

"Infectious mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr virus, and chronic fatigue syndrome: a prospective case series  Epstein-Barr viral infection, specifically infectious mononucleosis, typically has a more protracted course than other acute viral illnesses. Some recent observers have additionally suggested the possibility that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the etiologic infectious agent in chronic fatigue syndrome, based on the finding of higher proportions of elevated antibodies to the EBV early antigen in some patients complaining of chronic fatigue. Straus et al reported on 23 patients with chronic fatigue, 83% of whom exhibited persistently elevated antibodies in modest titer to the early antigen. Ten of these patients had never fully recovered from an episode of acute infectious mononucleosis. Other studies had noted similar associations between persistently elevated antibodies to EBV-specific antigens and chronic symptoms in patients who presented with chronic symptoms after mononucleosis. Three important antigen complexes, demonstrable by immunofluorescence procedures, are expressed in EBV-infected cells. The early antigen is thought to function perhaps in early replication of viral DNA. A late antigenic complex, the viral capsid antigen, may represent, in addition to structural capsid proteins, components of the viral enzymatic machinery for late phases of replication or transformation. The Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen is felt to function in viral transformation of host cells.",Virus_Diseases
"Idiopathic and L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilic fasciitis before and after L-tryptophan contamination. Recently, a causative association has been made between the ingestion of levotryptophan (L-tryptophan) and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a new entity manifested by peripheral blood eosinophilia, myalgias, constitutional symptoms, and cutaneous edema with fibrosis. Contaminated levotryptophan preparations produced at a single manufacturing company between October 1988 and June 1989 have been implicated in all EMS cases. In this study, we analyzed retrospectively 49 patients with cutaneous fibrosis for a history of levotryptophan use. Levotryptophan ingestion prior to the onset of their disease was reported by 11 (65%) of 17 patients with eosinophilic fascilitis (EF), two (20%) of 10 patients with localized scleroderma, and none of 22 patients with systemic sclerosis. The onset of levotryptophan-associated cutaneous disease preceded the availability of contaminated levotryptophan preparations in seven (54%) of 13 patients. One patient with levotryptophan-associated generalized morphea also had lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and acanthosis nigricans, findings not previously reported in patients with EMS. In addition, we compared the clinical and laboratory features of levotryptophan-associated EF and idiopathic EF. Myalgias, muscle weakness, paresthesias, morpheaform plaques, cutaneous ulcers, and livedo reticularis were more common in patients with levotryptophan-associated EF. We conclude that levotryptophan-associated EF and localized scleroderma were present before the presumed date of contaminated levotryptophan availability. The clinical spectrum of cutaneous fibrosis associated with the ingestion of levotryptophan includes generalized morphea and EF, which are similar though not identical to their idiopathic counterparts.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The results were assessed by macroscopic, radiologic, and histologic methods. The degenerative lesions increased proportionally to the amount of meniscal tissue resected and the duration of observation.

The 23 infected macaques had significantly lower mean plasma thiol and higher glutamate concentrations than 18 uninfected controls (p less than 0.001). The changes were apparent by 1 week after infection. Thus, abnormal plasma glutamate and thiol concentrations are, at least in this model, a direct and early consequence of the retroviral infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Detection of cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for synthetic peptides of gp160 in HIV-seropositive individuals. Four synthetic peptides corresponding to the IIIB sequence of gp160 of HIV were recently reported to stimulate Th cell function by PBL from HIV-infected, asymptomatic patients. In the present report, we used these same peptides to demonstrate CTL activity in a similar patient population. EBV-transformed B-cell lines from asymptomatic, HIV seropositive and seronegative control donors were pre-incubated with the peptides. Fresh PBL from 19 (76%) of 25 HIV seropositive donors lysed autologous targets pulsed with at least one of the four peptides. Autologous targets pulsed with two non-immunogenic peptides were not lysed. PBL from none of the eight HIV seronegative controls lysed peptide-preincubated autologous targets. The CTL activity was mediated by T cells, was predominantly MHC class I restricted, and was increased by in vitro restimulation of PBL with the peptides. HLA A-2 was identified as a restricting element for all four peptides in different patients, and for three of the peptides in the same donor. HLA-A1 or -B8 may also present some of the peptides. Thus, the same peptides can be recognized by human Th cells and class I MHC-restricted CTL.",Virus_Diseases

Patients with PSS compared to normal subjects had significantly lower percentages of CD3+ (p less than 0.005) and CD8+ (p less than 0.05) (similar to several patients with rheumatoid arthritis also evaluated), as well as CD45R (p less than 0.05), T+DR+ (p less than 0.05), and NKH-1 (CD56) (p less than 0.0005) cells. Patients with PSS with late-limited or generalized disease had lower percentages of CD8+, CD19, NKH-1+, and CDw29, but higher percentages of CD4+, HNK-1, and CD45R cells compared to patients with early stage disease, but these results were not statistically significant.

Imaging in influenza A encephalitis. Two cases of influenza A encephalitis seen during an outbreak of influenza types A/England/427/88 (H3N2) and A/Taiwan/1/86 (H1N1) in December 1989 are described. In both children the encephalitis developed within three days of the respiratory symptoms and both became comatose within 48 hours. Virological studies showed that the patients had had a recent influenza A infection. Symmetrical localised hypodense lesions within the thalami and pons were demonstrated in both cases on computed tomography of the brain and striking findings in the pons in one case on magnetic resonance imaging.

"Encephalitogenicity for rats of myelin basic protein without the aid of water-in-oil emulsions. The induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) with purified myelin basic protein (MBP) has, heretofore, required its incorporation in a water-in-oil emulsion or adsorption on particulate adjuvants. In the present work, the absorption of a saline solution of MBP from the peritoneal cavity into the mediastinal lymph nodes was increased by giving repeated inoculations or by pretreating rats with a peritoneal irritant. Under these conditions, the only adjuvant needed for production of EAE was aqueous pertussis vaccine which was injected separately a few hours or one day after the MBP. Pertussis vaccine was also necessary for production of EAE with intradermal injection of aqueous MBP. By injecting the aqueous MBP directly into pre-enlarged popliteal lymph nodes, it was possible to produce EAE without the pertussis vaccine. Thus, EAE can be induced in rats using MBP without the addition of Freund's adjuvant or pertussis vaccine.",Virus_Diseases
"Dermal mast cell degranulation in systemic sclerosis. Paired biopsy samples from involved and uninvolved skin were obtained from 19 patients with generalized scleroderma (11 with early, progressive disease and 8 with late, improving disease).

The number of mast cells was increased in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), in both involved and uninvolved skin and in both early and late disease. There was an increase in the number of degranulated mast cells in the involved skin of patients with both early and late disease and in the not-yet-involved skin of patients with early disease; however, there was no increase in the number of degranulated mast cells in areas of previously involved but now normal skin of patients with late disease. Increases in mast cell number and degranulation precede clinically apparent dermal fibrosis in SSc.

"Extracellular binding sites of IgA anti-jejunal antibodies on normal small bowel detected by indirect immunoelectronmicroscopy. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) have IgA deposition in the papillary dermis and in the lamina propria of the small bowel. In addition, most of DH patients' sera contain IgA class anti-reticulin antibodies, anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA), and anti-jejunal antibodies (JAB) during times of gluten intake. In previous studies, JAB and EMA seemed to be identical and related to the group of anti-reticulin antibodies. In the present study, pre-embedding en bloc immunoelectronmicroscopic methods were applied for analysis of the ultrastructural binding sites of JAB on monkey and rabbit small bowels. These substrates were incubated with sera from DH patients strongly positive for JAB. Simultaneous investigations with the PAP technique and with 5 nm gold-labeled protein A or second antibodies visualized the bound IgA identically: it was associated with collagen fibrils underlying the epithelial and cryptal basement membranes and with collagen fibrils around capillaries. Staining was also detected along the endomysial collagen fibrils of smooth muscle layers, around elastica and smooth muscle cells of blood vessel walls, and along collagen fibrils near smooth muscle cells in the lamina propria. Neither the peroxidase product nor gold deposition was detected directly on the fibers, but was associated with amorphous material surrounding collagen fibers of different diameters. The distribution of JAB-stained structures corresponded to the localization of reticulin network of the small bowel. Our data indicate that JAB recognize an antigen or antigens associated with an amorphous component of the reticulin-collagen structure of jejunum and may have identical binding sites, as anti-reticulin antibodies and EMA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Selective in vivo removal of rheumatoid factor by an extracorporeal treatment device in rheumatoid arthritis patients  A prospective phase II trial was conducted to assess the feasibility, tolerance, and efficacy of a device designed for selective removal of rheumatoid factor from the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The device contained terpolymer hydrogel-coated plates with chemically attached, aggregated human immunoglobulin G, and it operated as an immunoaffinity column. Sixty-one patients aged 25 to 73 underwent weekly plasmapheresis treatments (the primary therapy phase). During the trial, patients continued current rheumatoid arthritis medications without dose adjustments. All patients received two to six treatments (primary therapy). Responding patients were eligible to continue apheresis treatment every 2 to 6 weeks (maintenance therapy). No serious, untoward side effects were noted in the course of this study; of 640 treatments, only 2 (in different patients) were aborted, one because of complaints of dizziness and angioedema and the other because of chest tightness and shortness of breath. Except for a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in serum iron, no significant changes in complete blood count, serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function tests, or serum C3 and C4 were noted. Although the trial was not designed to determine clinical efficacy, patients noted less morning stiffness, longer time to onset of fatigue, and improved global pain assessment (p less than 0.004); significant objective improvements were noted in joint pain, tenderness, swelling, and the number of affected joints (p less than 0.001). One-half of the treated patients had at least a 50 percent improvement in objective measures of antirheumatic activity.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Phenotypic characteristics of dissociated mononuclear cells from rheumatoid synovial membrane. The phenotypic characteristics of enzymatically dissociated synovial membrane mononuclear cells from 8 patients (14 samples) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were assessed by fluorescence activated flow cytometry and compared to peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells from 18 patients with RA and 14 normal controls. There was no significant difference between the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in synovial membrane compared to RA and normal PB. Double labelling experiments revealed similar percentages of CD4+ CDw29+ (helper-inducer) and CD4+ CD45R+ (suppressor-inducer) cells in RA and normal PB. In contrast, SM CD4+ CDw29+ cells were present in significantly higher proportions than in RA and normal PB (p less than 0.001). Conversely, synovial membrane CD4+ CD45R+ cells were present in significantly lower proportions than in RA and normal PB (p less than 0.001). A similar pattern of CDw29 and CD45R antigen expression was noted on CD8+ lymphocytes reflecting increased killer-effector (p less than 0.001) and decreased suppressor-effector (p less than 0.001) cells, respectively. Other experiments revealed a significant increase in the percentage of synovial membrane CD20+ cells (B lymphocytes) and HLA-DR+ cells compared to RA PB (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.001) and normal PB (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.005), and similar proportions of CD14+ cells (monocytes/macrophages). Our results suggest that RA synovial membrane contains populations of T and B lymphocytes that differ quantitatively and qualitatively from those in PB. These may account for some of the abnormalities in intraarticular humoral and cellular immune responses in patients with RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Identification and characterization of opsonic fibronectin in synovial fluids of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. A cofactor that selectively opsonizes particulate activators of the human alternative complement pathway and enhances their phagocytosis by human monocytes was identified in synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The active material was present in fluids treated with protease inhibitors, was heat stable, and was unaffected by incubation with hyaluronidase. Chromatographic isolation of synovial fluid fibronectin by gelatin affinity and by immunoaffinity on antifibronectin monoclonal antibody BD4 yielded similar quantities of protein for each of 3 fluids. Synovial fluid proteins with the BD4 fibronectin epitope accounted for essentially all of the phagocytosis-enhancing activity and expressed this activity by opsonizing target activators. Additional chromatographic analyses of synovial fluid fibronectin with the BD4 epitope were carried out using Sepharose-bearing gelatin and 4 additional antifibronectin monoclonal antibodies. The opsonic materials were characterized as having 2 distinct fibronectin epitopes, which always mapped from the cell adhesive domain to the carboxyl-terminus of plasma fibronectin, but only rarely contained the gelatin binding domain.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The increased frequency of cervical dysplasia-neoplasia in women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus is related to the degree of immunosuppression. Cytologic and histologic investigations of the uterine cervix and studies of the lymphocyte functions were performed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected and human immunodeficiency virus antibody-negative women to study possible linkages between human papillomavirus-induced dysplasia and degree of human immunodeficiency virus-induced immunosuppression. Cytologic smears of the uterine cervix of 111 human immunodeficiency virus-infected women were compared with findings in 76 female intravenous drug users negative for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and in a group of 526 women of the outpatient population of the hospital. Cervical dysplasia-neoplasia (including five cases of invasive carcinoma) was seen in 41% of the human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. In human immunodeficiency virus-negative intravenous drug users dysplasia-neoplasia was seen in 9%, and in the sample from outpatients in 4%, including two cases of invasive carcinoma (p less than 0.01). Cytologic features that were attributable to infection with human papillomavirus were observed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women four times more often than in the sample from the outpatient population (p less than 0.01). Frequency and severity of dysplasia appear to increase with diminishing numbers of CD4+ helper/inducer T lymphocytes and correlated significantly (p less than 0.01) with a loss of blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and tetanus toxoid. These results suggest an increased risk for the development of dysplasia of the uterine cervix in women with human immunodeficiency virus infection, which is related to the degree of immunosuppression.",Virus_Diseases

"Long-term assessment of the effects of circumferential truncal burns in pediatric patients on subsequent pregnancies. Longitudinal assessment of the long-term effects of pediatric circumferential truncal burns on subsequent pregnancies is poorly documented. Between December 1967 and August 1985, 75 female pediatric patients with circumferential truncal injuries were admitted to our institution. Twenty-two of these patients were available for long-term follow-up into early adulthood. Seven of these 22 patients had conceived. All seven patients had sustained flame-burn injuries. Mean age at injury was 7.66 +/- 2.12 years. Mean total body surface area of burns was 63.21% +/- 16.69%, with 44.21% +/- 17.54% of the injuries full thickness. Each patient was treated with excision and split-thickness skin grafting during initial hospitalization. In the group of seven patients there were 14 pregnancies. All infants were full term. There were 13 vaginal deliveries and one elective cesarean section. Prenatal complications were limited to one case in which a patient had sustained breakdown of scar tissue during the third trimester of pregnancy. There were no labor and delivery complications in this patient population. Circumferential truncal burns appear to have no impact on prenatal or labor and delivery complications.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Complete follow-up and evaluation of a skin cancer screening in Connecticut. On May 21, 1988, 251 persons were screened for skin cancer in New Haven, Connecticut. A total body skin examination was performed on 98% of the participants. On the basis of follow-up of 93% of persons with positive screens for basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or Bowen's disease, positive predictive values were 43% for basal cell carcinoma, 14% for squamous cell carcinoma, and 50% for Bowen's disease. In the group with atypical nevi, a person with two or more clinically atypical nevi was 16 times more likely to have histologic confirmation than a person with a single clinically atypical nevus (p = 0.003). Eighty persons were screened by both a dermatologist and a dermatology nurse; the crude agreement rate for actinic keratoses was 0.62; for atypical nevi, 0.53; and for BCC, 0.88. Both nurses and physicians overdiagnosed in the screening setting, the nurses more so than the physicians.

"Measles update. The incidence of measles in the United States dramatically increased in the 1980s, from a low of 1,497 cases in 1983 to over 17,000 cases in 1989. Family physicians can help reverse this trend by following the revised immunization schedule, which includes a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) booster for preschool-age children. New guidelines also recommend that either the two-dose MMR schedule or serologic evidence of immunity be required for all persons entering college or employed in the medical field. Immunization policies for physician's offices should ensure that all office staff have acquired measles immunity and that a triage policy separating patients with rash from those with other illnesses is utilized. Mild upper respiratory illness, a history of seizures, nonanaphylactic egg allergy and asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection are not contraindications to measles vaccine.

"Acyclovir therapy in neonates. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of acyclovir disposition in neonates with renal dysfunction. DESIGN: Prospective sequential open enrollment of neonates with presumed herpes group virus infections. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. PATIENTS: Sixteen neonates with gestational ages between 27 and 40 weeks (median 38 weeks) were given acyclovir between days 1 and 56 of life to treat presumed herpes virus infections. Six infants were critically ill with multisystem disease, five infants had hepatic failure and underwent blood exchange transfusion, and five infants had renal failure. A mean of four (range 1 to 19) serum acyclovir concentrations per patient were measured by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from acyclovir concentrations in 46 samples from 16 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic disposition of acyclovir was described as a two-compartment model. Although the ranges for acyclovir clearance and terminal elimination (t 1/2 beta) were wide, a statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between clearance and beta versus serum creatinine concentration. The average t 1/2 beta for infants with serum creatinine level less than 1 mg/dl (88 mumol/L) was 5.0 hours, and 15.6 hours for those with serum creatinine level greater than 1 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with hepatic or renal dysfunction or young premature infants accumulate acyclovir when dosed without adjustment for organ dysfunction. Measurement of serum creatinine or creatinine clearance can be useful in the dosing of acyclovir in neonates.",Virus_Diseases
"A preliminary report on the neuropsychologic sequelae of human immunodeficiency virus. The neuropsychologic sequelae of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and human immunodeficiency virus were studied by comparing the results of a neuropsychologic test battery administered to the following three groups of Danish homosexual men: 20 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 20 asymptomatic subjects who tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, and a matched control group of 20 subjects who tested negative for the human immunodeficiency virus. The group with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome performed significantly worse than the control subjects on the tests measuring concentration, memory, and psychomotor speed. The group with human immunodeficiency virus performed significantly worse than the control subjects on the tests measuring verbal memory and psychomotor speed. On the other tests, their results varied. The study supports the hypothesis that not only patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but also asymptomatic subjects with human immunodeficiency virus may be neuropsychologically impaired early in the course of the disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Inositol metabolism in mononuclear leucocytes from patients with atopic dermatitis. Elevated activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) has been previously documented in the peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes (MNLs) of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Because of the potential interactions of the cyclic nucleotide and inositol secondary messenger systems we sought to determine whether differences exist in the inositol uptake and metabolism between atopic and normal MNLs. We found no difference in the uptake of tritiated inositol by MNL between 19 atopic patients and 16 non-atopic control subjects. However, after stimulation of MNLs by concanavalin A, there was a significantly greater metabolism of inositol to inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) in the controls compared to the atopic MNLs; the mean percentage rise in the IP1 fraction over baseline level was 40% in the atopics, but almost 200% in controls after 2 h. Diminished inositol metabolism in atopic MNLs may explain the reduced cell-mediated immunity that characterizes the atopic state.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Infantile acute hemorrhagic edema of the skin: study of ten cases. Infantile acute hemorrhagic edema of the skin is not included as a separate entity in the current English-language literature as it is in continental Europe. Therefore we have attempted to clarify the nosologic position of acute hemorrhagic edema among cutaneous vasculitides in children, on the basis of our experience in 10 cases. Our study confirms that acute hemorrhagic edema affects infants between 4 and 24 months of age. The two main features are an ecchymotic purpura, often in a cockade pattern, and an inflammatory edema of the limbs and face. Visceral involvement is uncommon. Spontaneous and complete resolution occurs within 1 to 3 weeks; one to four attacks may occur. Histopathologic examination demonstrates a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Perivascular IgA deposits can occasionally be found. Besides typical acute hemorrhagic edema, some cases in 2- to 4-year-old children appear to overlap with Schonlein-Henoch purpura. We suggest that typical acute hemorrhagic edema should be regarded as a separate clinical entity. This allows an appropriate prognosis to be made for this generally benign disease of infants.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The eye of the third patient was grafted for pseudophakic bullous keratopathy. At the time of onset of dendritic keratitis, all three patients were receiving either maintenance or higher doses of topical corticosteroids. All infections responded to topical antiviral treatment. The findings in these patients illustrate the importance of considering herpes simplex keratitis in the differential diagnosis of all late-onset epithelial defects in the corneal graft, even in the absence of a history of herpes simplex keratitis.",Virus_Diseases
"Placebo-controlled trial to evaluate zidovudine in treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection in asymptomatic patients with hemophilia. NHF-ACTG 036 Study Group. One hundred ninety-three asymptomatic patients with hereditary coagulation disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were studied in a controlled trial of zidovudine (ZDV) versus a placebo (with an average of 9.7 months on study). Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced between the placebo and drug-treated groups, including CD4 distributions, types of clotting disorders, transaminase abnormalities, and use of various hemostatic agents. At the time of analysis, 161 patients either were still receiving treatment or had previously reached an endpoint of disease progression while receiving treatment. Twenty-five patients withdrew voluntarily. The toxic effects noted included granulocytopenia and anemia, especially in older patients, and subjective symptoms of asthenia, malaise, and nausea, consistent with the known consequences of treatment with 300 mg ZDV five times daily. There was a trend toward more diagnoses of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), advanced or early AIDS-related complex (ARC), single ARC symptoms, or death in placebo recipients as compared with those receiving ZDV (22 v 13). Because older patients with hemophilia have more rapid disease progression, the same efficacy analysis was performed in the 89 patients aged more than 30 years who were receiving treatment. In this subgroup, there was a similar trend (11 v 6). With regard to the most advanced problems of the infection among the older patients, there were five patients who were newly diagnosed with AIDS or died in the placebo group versus none in the ZDV group (P = .02) among the older patients. The pretreatment distribution of CD4 counts for the placebo and ZDV groups were similar, but patients aged more than 30 years had significantly (P less than .049) fewer CD4 cells than patients aged less than 30 years. A beneficial ZDV effect is also supported by a trend toward higher CD4 counts (a 48-cell increase in the ZDV group at 24 weeks as compared with a four-cell increase in the placebo group) and a significant (P = .03) difference in weight gain in the ZDV patients aged more than 30 years (8 pounds) as compared with the older placebo patients (aged more than 30 years) (2 pounds) at week 24. The findings in the asymptomatic hemophilic patients aged more than 30 years support a useful effect of ZDV, which is similar to observations in the larger study of its use in asymptomatic, nonhemophilic patients.",Virus_Diseases
Immunocytochemical analysis of lymph node aspirates in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Thirty four patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had lymphadenopathy were investigated using fine needle aspiration. Cytological analysis included immunocytochemical investigation with the alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method. All patients had confirmation of cytological diagnosis by lymph node biopsy. Fifteen aspirates with follicular hyperplasia were evaluated. Eleven patients showed B cell predominance. The B cell population did not show light chain restriction. Ten patients with B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (five with Burkitt's lymphoma and five with B cell immunoblastic lymphoma) were investigated. Nine out of 10 cases were monoclonal with respect to their light chain determinants; only one case with Burkitt's lymphoma with partial lymph node metastasis did not show light chain restriction. The cytological diagnosis included two mycobacterial infections and four cystic lesions. Histological investigation was necessary to diagnose the extent of lymph node disease caused by Kaposi's sarcoma. These findings indicate that the immunocytological investigation of lymph node aspirates is useful for evaluating lymphadenopathy in HIV positive patients.,Virus_Diseases

"A case of photosensitivity and contact allergy to systemic tricyclic drugs, with unusual features. A 43-year-old farmer on tricyclic antidepressive drugs developed a severe photodermatitis with associated liver involvement.

Patch and photopatch testing revealed photoallergy and contact allergy to clomipramine and contact allergy also to carbamazepine. In addition, the patient had positive patch test reactions to chlorpromazine, balsam of Peru and fragrance-mix, as well as a positive photopatch test to fentichlor. UVA and UVB erythema thresholds were normal. In this patient, an initial episode of photosensitization, probably elicited by clomipramine, was accompanied by contact allergy to this drug and to carbamazepine. The contact sensitivity to clomipramine could also be elicited by oral provocation without UV light.

Each of these three models has contributed clues to our understanding of RA and have yielded promising new approaches to treatment. These include combination pharmacotherapy, antigen-specific therapy, cell-specific therapy, and monoclonal antibody therapy.

"Split-thickness skin grafting of the myelomeningocele defect: a subset at risk for late ulceration. The appropriate method and timing of the management of the myelomeningocele defect have prompted considerable discussion. Use of split-thickness skin grafts acutely has accomplished wound closure with low morbidity and mortality. This study was designed to address the question of long-term suitability of the technique of split-thickness skin grafting of the myelomeningocele patient. The incidence of late and/or severe skin ulceration and the presence of gibbus deformity were correlated with the method of skin closure. Long-term follow-up revealed a higher incidence of chronic skin ulceration in the split-thickness skin graft group as compared with the primary closure group. All skin breakdowns appeared in the presence of a gibbus deformity, and gibbus deformity was more prevalent in the split-thickness skin graft group. The incidence of skin ulceration and gibbus deformity was site-dependent. A thoracic or thoracolumbar myelomeningocele repair with split-thickness skin graft was significantly more likely to be complicated by skin problems than the defect in the lumbar, lumbosacral, or sacral region. This relationship was secondary to the frequency of gibbus deformity in the more cephalad defects than defects caudad. A treatment plan is outlined that is based on the primary variable of the location of the myelomeningocele and secondarily by defect size.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Cyclosporin A in atopic dermatitis: therapeutic response is dissociated from effects on allergic reactions. Fourteen patients with severe chronic atopic dermatitis were treated with cyclosporin A (CyA, Sandimmun; 5 mg/kg/day) for 7-16 weeks. All showed a marked clinical improvement and half could omit topical corticosteroid treatment during therapy. Adverse effects were minor, but two patients relapsed despite continued treatment. In the others, the disease recurred soon after stopping CyA. Serum IgE levels and prick-test responses were unchanged by CyA. Immediate and late-phase cutaneous responses to intradermal house dust mite antigen (HDM) were significantly increased during treatment; but a delayed response, present at 24 and 48 h, was unaffected.

"Development of cross-reactive antibodies to plasminogen during the immune response to dengue virus infection. The four serotypes of dengue virus (a mosquito-borne flavivirus) cause an acute febrile illness (dengue fever) or a more prolonged illness with plasma leakage resulting in hypovolemia (dengue hemorrhagic fever). Hemorrhage may accompany either. Epidemiologic data suggest a role for dengue antibodies in pathogenesis. Computer analysis revealed a 20-residue region of similarity in amino acid sequence between the dengue type 4 envelope glycoprotein (E) and a family of clotting factors, including plasminogen, the prime mediator of fibrinolysis. By use of synthetic peptides in ELISA, E antibodies that potentially bind plasminogen were detected in 75% of 40 Thai patients acutely infected with dengue virus type 1, 2, 3, or 4. Plasminogen cross-reactivity of dengue antibodies was shown to be specific for the related sites in E and plasminogen. The dengue E sequence with similarity to plasminogen is largely conserved within the currently known flavivirus E sequences. However, 15 Thai patients hospitalized for illness caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (a flavivirus not associated with hemorrhage) did not develop plasminogen-cross-reactive antibodies, and this finding correlated with failure of Japanese encephalitis virus antibodies to bind to the plasminogen-cross-reactive site in E.",Virus_Diseases
"Polymerase chain reaction evidence for human immunodeficiency virus 1 neutralization by passive immunization in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex. We tried to assess the long-term safety and potential efficacy of passive immunization in AIDS-related-complex (ARC) and AIDS patients. We also wanted to establish whether hyperimmune plasma from healthy human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals clears the cell-free virus from circulation. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we were able to provide conclusive evidence that hyperimmune plasma is effective and maintains long-term neutralization of viremia. Using the cell test, we found that in most patients the total antibody level was maintained; in one of the ARC patients, it actually increased 8-fold and has remained at that level for nearly 2 years. The CD4+ cell count decreased in the AIDS patients but was stable in the ARC patient. Clinically, there was an initial improvement in all patients, but five of six of the advanced/terminal AIDS patients had died by month 17. Our studies suggest that passive immunization may be safe in ARC and AIDS patients. It reduces HIV-1 viremia to levels undetectable even by PCR. To advanced/terminal patients, the benefit is of limited duration, while to ARC patients it may be long-term. Therefore, passive immunization should start early in the disease.",Virus_Diseases
"Establishment and characterization of a new cell line TC-YIK originating from argyrophil small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix integrating HPV16 DNA. A new cell line, designated TC-YIK, was established from YIK-1 tumor cells, derived from argyrophil small cell carcinoma (ASCC) of the uterine cervix, and serially heterotransplanted into nude mice, integrating human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA. The population doubling time of TC-YIK was approximately 21.6 hours at the 119th subculture. Subcutaneous injection of 1 x 10(8) TC-YIK cells into nude mice yielded a solid tumor. The cytologic appearance of TC-YIK was similar to that of YIK-1. The TC-YIK cells contained argyrophil granules and neurosecretory granules in the cytoplasm and showed positive immunohistochemical staining for neuron-specific enolase, serotonin, and chromogranin. Thus, TC-YIK retained the histochemical characteristics of ASCC. The TC-YIK cells contained HPV16 DNA in a multiple-copy integrated form and actively transcribed the integrated HPV16 genome. Amplification of the c-myc oncogene was observed in the TC-YIK cells. These data suggest that TC-YIK is a useful in vitro experimental model of ASCC and that HPV16 and c-myc may play some role in the genesis of this malignant tumor and/or maintenance of the transformed TC-YIK phenotype.",Virus_Diseases
"Winning the battle, losing the war? Another editorial about rheumatoid arthritis. Major advances in the therapy of RA will likely require future scientific breakthroughs in the understanding of pathophysiology. That is not to suggest that clinical investigations should be put on hold while the entire focus of research shifts to the laboratory bench. Clinical studies of very early RA, including early treatment interventions, would appear to be of major importance. However, better characterization of the early clinical course and identification of pathologic markers of progressive disease are needed before formal randomized treatment studies of early disease can be initiated. The entire role of aggressive management, particularly with combination chemotherapy, at any stage of RA is in desperate need of answers. In clinical practice it would appear that combination chemotherapy is widely used, often as a last resort in treatment resistant patients who have failed conventional therapies. The published clinical studies would seem to support, but certainly not prove, a valuable potential role for combination chemotherapy in this setting. Moreover, the studies seem to indicate some increased risk of drug toxicities, the limitations of which are not readily apparent for most combinations. Based on the successes observed in these patients that are very difficult to treat, the possibility of a more fundamental role of combination chemotherapy in treatment of the disease has been advocated. These questions need to be resolved by well designed, randomized controlled trials. There is an urgent need to do the trials soon before combination chemotherapy gains an even stronger foothold in therapy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Role of flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related pulmonary disease. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 16 pediatric patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and deterioration in pulmonary function suggestive of opportunistic infection. In 62% of the patients Pneumocystis carinii was identified. Culture results showed a pure growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for one patient in addition to the Pneumocystis carinii. Bronchoscopy with lavage was well tolerated, with few complications even among patients with significant tachypnea and hypoxia. Because of its relative safety and effectiveness, this procedure should be considered the first invasive measurement used for evaluation of parenchymal lung disease in this population of patients.",Virus_Diseases
"Vaginal birth after cesarean: a meta-analysis of morbidity and mortality. The cesarean birth rate has continued to climb despite efforts to counteract it. A major reason for this rise is the practice of elective repeat cesarean. We conducted a meta-analysis that included 31 studies with a total of 11,417 trials of labor to evaluate the association between birth route after a cesarean and morbidity and mortality for the mother and infant. Summary odds ratios were calculated. Maternal febrile morbidity was significantly lower after a trial of labor than after an elective repeat cesarean. The intended birth route made no difference in the rates of uterine dehiscence or rupture. The use of oxytocin, presence of a recurrent indication for the previous cesarean, and presence of an unknown uterine scar were also unassociated with dehiscence or rupture. After excluding antepartum deaths, fetuses weighing less than 750 g, and congenital anomalies incompatible with life, we found no difference in perinatal death rates. The proportion of 5-minute Apgar scores of 6 or lower was higher after a trial of labor, but we were unable to exclude very low birth weight fetuses or those with congenital anomalies from this analysis. Our findings argue for trials of labor for more women after a cesarean birth.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Diversity of rheumatoid synovial tissue T cells by T cell receptor analysis. Oligoclonal expansion in interleukin-2-responsive cells. The synovitis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by infiltrates of CD4+ T lymphocytes. To determine the clonal diversity of these cells, we cloned T cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2), alone or with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), directly from actively inflamed synovial tissue obtained at synovectomy. A total of 205 clones from 4 specimens was analyzed for T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements using Hind III and Eco RI digests with beta chain and gamma chain complementary DNA probes. A comparison of the TCR rearrangements enabled us to determine if the T cell clones arose from the same or different precursor cells. Most of the T cell clones (92%) had distinct TCR gene rearrangement patterns, indicating a unique clonal origin. However, a few clones (1 quadruplicate and 6 pairs) with identical TCR rearrangements were identified, and these clonal multiples were most commonly found in clones selected with IL-2 alone. Mass cultures were propagated with IL-2, alone or with PHA, and at each passage, cells were removed for TCR analysis. The later passages of the lines selected with IL-2 had oligoclonal TCR rearrangements, whereas no oligoclonal rearrangements were found in the PHA + IL-2-selected cell lines. The TCR rearrangements in the later passages of the IL-2 mass cultures were often identical to the TCR rearrangements that were found in the IL-2-derived clonal multiples. These findings indicate that while the majority of CD4+ T cells within the actively inflamed rheumatoid joint have diverse clonal origins, small numbers of clonal multiples and oligoclonal populations are present, and these cells may be enriched in an IL-2-responsive T cell subset.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"High incidence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus in alcoholic cirrhosis: fact or fiction? An enzyme immunoassay (Ortho-HCV ELISA) for antibodies against the hepatitis C virus was used to test serum samples from 39 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 34 patients with alcoholic hepatitis or fatty liver. The frequency of a positive result in the cirrhotics was significantly higher than in the alcoholics without cirrhosis (38.5% vs 8.8%, P less than 0.01). However, the positive results in the cirrhotics were associated with high gammaglobulin concentrations, and optical density values in the assay correlated closely with serum globulin (r = 0.73, P less than 0.01). The findings suggest that serum from patients with alcoholic cirrhosis may contain a component that give false-positive results in the assay.",Virus_Diseases
"Extracellular collagenase, proteoglycanase and products of their activity, released in organ culture by intact dermal inflammatory lesions produced by sulfur mustard. Peak (1 and 2 d) and healing (3, 6, and 10 d) inflammatory lesions were produced in rabbits by the topical application of the military vesicant, bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide, commonly called sulfur mustard (SM). SM produces an acute sterile dermal inflammatory reaction with little or no necrosis, except in the epidermis, which dies during the first day. After an animal was killed, its lesions were excised intact, as full-thickness 1.0-cm2 explants. They were then organ-cultured for 3 d in order to maintain the viability of both local and infiltrating cells. The extracellular fluid in each lesion equilibrated with the culture fluid, which was collected daily and analyzed for collagenase and proteoglycanase activities. These metalloproteinase activities were measured after we had i) destroyed the alpha-macroglobulin inhibitors with KSCN, ii) destroyed the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) by reduction and alkylation, and iii) activated the latent proteinase activity with aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA). Hydroxyproline-containing peptides and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) released into the culture fluids were also measured as indicators of local collagenase and proteoglycanase activity within the inflammatory lesions. In general, the levels of both the metalloproteinases and the products of their activity were higher in second- and third-day culture fluids than in first-day culture fluids, and higher in fluids from SM lesions than in those from normal skin. The activated fibroblast was apparently the major cell type producing the collagenase and proteoglycanase. The hydrolysis of collagen and ground substance occurs pericellularly. An excess of inhibitors exists outside the pericellular region. The daily change in culture fluids apparently decreased such inhibitors, so that by the second and third day of culture we could detect the changes in pericellular enzyme activity that were not detectable on the first day of culture. As the inflammatory lesions healed, the extracellular enzyme products (hydroxyproline and GAG) increased more than the enzymes that produced these products. With healing, a decrease occurs in the extravasation of all serum components, especially the large ones such as the alpha-macroglobulin inhibitors. We propose that during healing, the decrease in these inhibitors allows the metalloproteinases to begin the remodeling process, and that during the peak phase of inflammation, these same inhibitors protect extracellular matrix against hydrolysis by such proteinases.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Interrelationship of blood transfusion, non-A, non-B hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis by detection of antibody to hepatitis C virus. To clarify the relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma as sequelae of non-A, non-B posttransfusion hepatitis, 231 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (96 with chronic hepatitis, 81 with cirrhosis and 54 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were analyzed for antibody to hepatitis C virus and were compared with 125 patients with chronic hepatitis B (50 with chronic hepatitis, 46 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 89.6%, 86.4% and 94.4% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis-related chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, compared with 6%, 17.4% and 34.5% with similar diseases related to hepatitis B. A history of transfusion was documented in 52%, 33% and 42% of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean intervals between the date of transfusion and the date of diagnosis of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were 10, 21.2 and 29 yr, respectively. In 21 patients with transfusion-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, anti-hepatitis C virus was present in each serial sample available for testing, including samples obtained up to 14 yr before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data suggest the slow, sequential progression from acute hepatitis C virus-related non-A, non-B hepatitis through chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma and support a causal association between hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma.",Virus_Diseases
"Frequent injecting impairs lymphocyte reactivity in HIV-positive and HIV-negative drug users. To investigate whether drug use affected immunological parameters, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 321 drug users. Absolute numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes and the T-cell reactivity were lower in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative people. The functional capacity of the T-cell system as measured after stimulation with a monoclonal antibody directed against CD3 was found to be strongly associated with the frequency of injecting, while no relationship was found between the frequency of injecting and the total number of lymphocytes or T-cell subsets. HIV-negative and HIV-positive drug users who had injected a mean of three times a day in the preceding 4-6 months had a T-cell reactivity which was 40-50% lower compared with seronegative and with seropositive drug users who had not injected in the preceding months. We conclude that lymphocyte reactivity is depressed by frequent injecting in HIV-negative and HIV-positive drug users.",Virus_Diseases
"Seroprevalence of HTLV-I/II and HIV-1 infection among male intravenous drug abusers in Chicago. We surveyed for serologic evidence of either HIV-1 or HTLV-I/II infection in 387 male veterans who entered into an inpatient drug treatment center. Serum was obtained after receiving written informed consent. Serum specimens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibody to HIV-1 and for antibody to HTLV-I/II; sera that were repeatedly reactive were then tested by Western blot (HIV-1/HTLV-I/II) and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (HTLV-I/II). Sixty-five of 387 (16.79%) patients were tested and confirmed as positive for HTLV-I/II only antibodies and 30 of the 387 (7.75%) were positive for HIV-1 only antibodies. An additional nine patients (2.32%) were seropositive for antibodies to both viruses. A statistically significant difference in the CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratio was associated with HIV-1 seropositivity. HTLV-I/II seropositivity was strongly associated with black race, age, and duration of i.v. drug use, but not with sexual intercourse as determined by lifetime history of number of sexual partners, incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, type of drug used, or needle-sharing practices.",Virus_Diseases
Two different point G to A mutations in exon 10 of the porphobilinogen deaminase gene are responsible for acute intermittent porphyria. Two mutations of the porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase gene resulting in cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM) positive forms of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) have been identified by in vitro amplification of cDNA and cloning of the amplified products in a bacterial expression vector. Both mutations resulted from G to A transitions in exon 10 of the gene and produced arginine to glutamine substitutions in the abnormal protein. Expression of mutant cDNA in Escherichia coli reveals that one but not the other of these amino acid changes results in a striking decrease of the optimal pH of the mutated enzyme. One or the other of these two mutations accounted for the defect causing AIP in six unrelated patients among the eight patients evaluated with the CRIM positive subtype of this disorder.,Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Modified Western blot assay for confirmation and differentiation of human T cell lymphotropic virus types I and II. Disease association studies of human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types I and II are hindered by the need for multiple assays to confirm and differentiate between the viruses. A modified Western blot assay has been developed using HTLV-I viral lysate and unique (MTA-4) and shared (p21E) HTLV recombinant proteins. By defining confirmation of infection as the presence of antibodies to p24 gag protein and to p21E, all 56 HTLV-I and 49 HTLV-II antisera were confirmed by this modified Western blot alone. Differentiation was determined by reactivity to MTA-4. All HTLV-I antisera reacted with MTA-4 and all HTLV-II antisera did not react with MTA-4. These findings indicate the utility of selected HTLV-I recombinant proteins in a single assay format to confirm and differentiate infections with HTLV-I and HTLV-II.",Virus_Diseases
"Bazex syndrome (acrokeratosis paraneoplastica). An analytic review. Bazex syndrome (acrokeratosis paraneoplastica) is characterized by a psoriasiform eruption that favors acral sites and has been associated with an underlying malignancy in all reported cases. Of the 93 patients in this series, 89 were male with a mean age of 60 +/- 8.5 years. Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and squamous cell tumors of unknown primary with cervical lymph node metastases were the most commonly associated neoplasms, suggesting that the factor(s) responsible for the development of the syndrome are relatively specific for tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract. The cutaneous lesions were erythematous to violaceous in color and had associated scale; the most frequently observed sites of involvement were the ears, nose, hands, and feet, including the nails. In 63% of the cases, the cutaneous lesions preceded the initial symptoms or diagnosis of the tumor by an average of 11 months (range, 1-72) and, in general, the eruption was resistant to a variety of topical treatments. Occasionally, a reappearance of the papulosquamous lesions signaled the recurrence of the tumor (6 cases) or the appearance of skin lesions coincided with the development of metastatic disease (3 cases). In 91% (64/70) of the patients, the skin eruption either improved significantly following treatment of the underlying malignancy or did not improve in the setting of persistent tumor. However, even when all of the skin lesions cleared, the nail dystrophy often persisted. Fifteen of the patients developed vesicles, bullae, and crusts in addition to papulosquamous lesions. Possible explanations include the formation of an epidermal-dermal split via a bullous lichen planus-like mechanism, or the coexistence of two diseases; i.e., acrokeratosis paraneoplastica plus either porphyria cutanea tarda, bullous pemphigoid, or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. One possible explanation for the development of the characteristic cutaneous eruption is an immune reaction, humoral or cellular, directed against a common antigen present on the tumor and the normal skin. Alternatively, tumor production of a keratinocyte growth factor such as TGF-alpha may be involved in the induction of the psoriasiform skin lesions.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Autoantibody to Th ribonucleoprotein (nucleolar 7-2 RNA protein particle) in patients with systemic sclerosis. We studied sera of 371 consecutive new patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) who were first evaluated during 1984-1988. All sera were tested for antinuclear antibodies by immunofluorescence staining using HEp-2 cells as substrate. We excluded 219 sera showing dark nucleoli and screened for antibodies to Th in the remaining 152 sera by immunoprecipitation of a 32P-labeled HeLa cell extract. Fifteen (4.0%) of 371 sera were anti-Th+. Anti-Th antibodies were present in 14 (8.4%) of 167 SSc patients with limited cutaneous involvement, in 1 of 167 with diffuse cutaneous involvement, and in 0 of 37 with SSc overlap syndrome. Among 244 controls with other connective tissue diseases, anti-Th was detected in only 3 patients, all having primary Raynaud's phenomenon of less than 2 years duration. In the subgroup with SSc with limited cutaneous involvement, the 14 anti-Th+ patients had a significantly greater frequency of puffy fingers, small bowel involvement, and hypothyroidism, and a significantly lower frequency of arthralgia and/or arthritis. Their cumulative survival rate from the time of onset of symptoms was lower than that for anti-Th- patients (78% versus 91% at 10 years), primarily due to 3 deaths from pulmonary arterial hypertension (2 from primary pulmonary hypertension and 1 from pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary interstitial fibrosis). Serum anti-Th antibodies are present almost exclusively in patients with SSc with limited cutaneous involvement or in those with primary Raynaud's phenomenon whose disease may evolve to SSc with limited cutaneous involvement, and these antibodies may identify those patients who are at greater risk for reduced survival.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus infection in street youths in Toronto, Canada. Hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus are transmitted by venereal contact or by the sharing of used needles during drug use. A questionnaire was administered to street youths admitting to prostitution and to a group denying prostitution, as well as to sexually active adolescents who lived with their family and were attending an adolescent medical clinic. The age, gender, race, number of sexual partners, condom use, illicit drug use, anal intercourse and admission to prostitution were recorded for each of the subjects. Serology was obtained for hepatitis B markers and human immunodeficiency virus antibody. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the factors which might predict hepatitis B serologic status. A single subject, who admitted to prostitution, was found to be human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive. Seven of 43 (16%) admitted prostitutes compared with 1 of 44 (2%) other street youth and none of 27 controls demonstrated anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies. The higher rate of seropositivity in admitted prostitutes was statistically significant (P less than 0.0097). Two seropositive prostitutes had IgM hepatitis B core antibody suggesting recent infection. Two factors, number of partners (P less than 0.0007) and practice of anal intercourse (P less than 0.05), were identified in the multiple regression analysis as predictive of seropositivity. Thus adolescents who live on the street are at increased risk for becoming infected with hepatitis B virus. The difficulty in ensuring vaccine coverage in this population would support calls for including hepatitis B vaccination as part of childhood immunization.",Virus_Diseases
"Effect of primary-stage feline immunodeficiency virus infection on subsequent feline calicivirus vaccination and challenge in cats. The effect of experimental primary-stage feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection on feline calicivirus (FCV) vaccination and challenge in cats was studied. Clinical signs of acute FCV disease were more widespread in the cats which were infected with FIV than in those which were not. FIV infection also prolonged shedding of FCV, with more of the FIV-infected cats becoming chronic carriers. Although vaccination induced protection against acute FCV disease, this was to a lesser degree in FIV-infected cats. Vaccination by itself also appeared to enhance long-term virus shedding. There was evidence of an impaired anamnestic FCV-neutralizing antibody response in FIV-infected cats following FCV challenge.",Virus_Diseases
"Mechanisms involved in allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin disease caused by agents such as plants, chemical compounds, and topical medications. Histologic features typically include edema within the epidermis and dermis and a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with an admixture of basophils. Langerhans cells and keratinocytes play pivotal roles in allergic contact dermatitis reactions. Langerhans cells synthesize and express class II molecules that allow the presentation of exogenous antigens to T lymphocytes. Additionally, keratinocytes and Langerhans cells produce interleukin-1, which is thought to be a second signal that activates T cells. Mast cells and basophils also may play a proinflammatory role. Treatment primarily consists of removal of the offending agent. At times, systemic corticosteroids may be required, especially in the acute phase. In more chronic cases, topical corticosteroids may be beneficial. Antihistamines may be useful because of their soporific effects, but their usefulness is limited.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Extravascular fibrin formation and dissolution in synovial tissue of patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Fibrin deposition is a prominent finding in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Macrophages are found in increased numbers in RA synovium, and these cells are known to produce a variety of procoagulant and anticoagulant molecules. Using immunohistologic techniques, the content and distribution of several important components of the coagulation system in the synovium of patients with RA, osteoarthritis (OA), or traumatic joint abnormalities requiring surgery were investigated. Samples from 3 patients from each category were examined in detail. RA synovium (compared with that of patients with OA or joint trauma) had increased numbers of macrophages and increased expression/content of fibrinogen, tissue factor, factor XIII, tissue transglutaminase, cross-linked fibrin (fibrin D dimer), urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. Macrophage content in RA synovium was increased in both the lining cell areas and the interstitial cell areas. Fibrinogen was distributed throughout the tissue in all samples and was greater in RA synovium. In trauma and OA synovia, tissue factor was seen only in association with vessels (endothelial cells), but in RA synovium, it was markedly increased throughout the tissues. While fibrin D dimer was seen in small amounts in synovial lining cell areas of trauma and OA synovia, it was present in increased amounts in the lining cell and interstitial cell areas of RA synovium. Factor XIII and tissue transglutaminase were present in scant amounts in trauma and OA synovia, but there were increased amounts of both (especially tissue transglutaminase) in RA synovium in the vessel, lining cell, and interstitial cell areas. Urokinase and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor were also markedly increased in RA synovium. These results suggest that in inflamed synovium, there is ongoing extravascular tissue fibrin formation and dissolution that correlates with the degree of inflammation and macrophage content. Extravascular coagulation/fibrinolysis in RA represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The role of the neutrophil in rheumatoid arthritis. Neutrophils acquire lysosomal granules and assembly systems for producing soluble mediators of inflammation during the process of maturation in the bone marrow. Subsequently, they emigrate from the circulation when they become attracted to joint spaces of rheumatoid arthritis patients by chemoattractants such as the complement split product, C5a, and leukotriene B4. Exposure to immune complexes, rheumatoid factor, and cytokines in the synovial fluid results in neutrophil activation with release of granule contents, toxic oxygen metabolites, and proinflammatory products of the arachidonic acid cascade. This process is analogous to a local Arthus reaction in which activation of the complement system is a central event. Some of the inflammatory materials released by this reaction contribute to the cartilage destruction seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Because others are chemoattractants themselves, they perpetuate intraarticular inflammation and permit the predominance of acute inflammatory cells in lesions maintained by chronic inflammation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"alpha-Peroxyachifolid and other new sensitizing sesquiterpene lactones from yarrow (Achillea millefolium L., Compositae). Yarrow, Achillea millefolium L., is one of the commonest weeds of the Compositae family. Cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been described since 1899. Although 10 sesquiterpene lactones (SL) and 3 polyines have previously been identified, the sensitizers of yarrow have escaped detection. A reinvestigation of short ether extracts of yarrow revealed the presence of 5 unsaturated hitherto unknown guaianolides of peroxide character. The main SL, identified as a strong sensitizer in guinea pig sensitization experiments, was named alpha-peroxyachifolid. The minor SL also contribute marginally to the sensitizing capacity, while other known yarrow constituents like dehydromatricaria ester and pontica epoxide appear to play no role. A 5-year follow-up (1985-1990) of Compositae-sensitive patients showed that more than 50% reacted when tested with a short ether extract of yarrow.

"Syringomatous squamous tumors of the breast. Four cases are reported of syringomatous squamous tumors of the breast occurring in women aged 37 to 70 years. The lesions were characterized histologically by relatively well-circumscribed tumor-like nodules composed of a proliferation of teardrop or comma-shaped islands of squamous epithelium. The squamous epithelial islands contained central lumens lined by eosinophilic cuticles and were surrounded by a densely cellular fibrous matrix, thus closely resembling the growth pattern of dermal eccrine syringomas. The lesions appeared to arise de novo from breast parenchyma without evidence of transitions with the surrounding normal or hyperplastic mammary epithelium and were not associated with the overlying skin or nipple epidermis. In all cases, the surrounding breast tissue showed fibrocystic and benign proliferative changes, and in one case, the lesion was found in the vicinity of a large cyst surrounded by microcalcifications. All patients were treated by local surgical excision and have shown no evidence of recurrence over a follow-up period of 1 to 6 years.

"Methotrexate and histologic hepatic abnormalities: a meta-analysis. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of liver toxicity from the long-term administration of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of 15 studies examining the relationship between long-term, low-dose methotrexate administration and biopsy evidence of liver fibrosis. PATIENTS: A total of 636 patients from 15 studies. RESULTS: The incidence of progression of liver disease (defined as worsening of at least one grade on the histologic classification of Roenigk) among 636 patients was 27.9% (95% confidence intervals 24.3 to 31.6). The rate of progression of liver disease in the 15 studies was associated with the cumulative dose of methotrexate (p = 0.01). Patients on average had a 6.7% (95% confidence intervals 2.1 to 11.4) chance of progressing at least one histologic grade on liver biopsy for each gram of methotrexate taken. The overall incidence of advanced pathologic changes on liver biopsy (grades IIIB or IV) among 636 patients was 5.0% (95% confidence intervals 3.5 to 7.0). The development of advanced histologic changes was not associated with the cumulative dose of methotrexate (p = 0.08). Patients who according to their history were heavy drinkers (at least 100 g of alcohol per week) were more likely to have advanced changes on liver biopsy (17.8% versus 4.5%, p = 0.0003) and to show histologic progression (73.3% versus 25.9%, p = 0.0002). Patients with psoriasis were more likely than patients with rheumatoid arthritis to have advanced changes (7.7% versus 2.7%, p = 0.003) and histologic progression (33.1% versus 24.3%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of liver toxicity in patients undergoing long-term, low-dose methotrexate therapy is substantial, and that risk increases with the total cumulative dose and with heavy consumption of alcohol. Heavy users of alcohol should not receive long-term methotrexate therapy. For most patients who are not heavy users of alcohol, liver biopsies should be done periodically to monitor for the occurrence of liver toxicity.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Specificity of antibodies to type II collagen in rheumatoid arthritis. To reassess the role of autoantibodies to type II collagen in the pathogenesis of diseases, we studied antibodies from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and from patients with relapsing polychondritis for species specificity and collagen type specificity, using an improved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibodies were found in the sera of 15% of the RA patients and 50% of the relapsing polychondritis patients, as well as in the cartilage of 69% of the RA patients examined. Reaction with both homologous and heterologous type II collagens was common. Analysis of 19 selected RA sera revealed that autoantibodies were generally associated with specific antibodies to some species of heterologous type II collagen. In contrast, antibodies found in 4% of the non-RA controls were specific for either bovine or chick type II collagen. These findings indicate that autoantibody formation in RA and relapsing polychondritis may occur as a result of an immune response to heterologous type II collagen. However, since RA and relapsing polychondritis patient sera differed in their reactivity with the cyanogen bromide-digested peptides, it is possible that the clinical manifestation of collagen autoimmunity might be influenced by the epitope specificity of the antibodies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

When treated surgically and with heparin prophylaxis, she developed heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis which necessitated amputation of a lower limb. Thus our patient developed 2 separate groups of autoantibodies associated with thrombotic events. Our case highlights an association between thrombosis, aPL and MCTD. Furthermore, it emphasizes a need for intensive monitoring when hypercoaguable individuals with connective tissue disorders are treated with heparin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Toxic dermatitis induced by 10-ethyl-10-deaza-aminopterin (10-EdAM), a novel antifolate. A new methotrexate analog, 10-ethyl-10-deaza-aminopterin (10-EdAM), was found to induce a particular form of skin toxicity different than the skin rash reported to result from methotrexate. At histologic examination, it was found to be a toxic dermatitis that clinically most often first appears on the lower legs but can occur anywhere in the body, especially if treatment is continued. Nine cases are reported. A specific risk factor could not yet be identified. Discontinuation of 10-EdAM administration leads to complete healing; concomitant corticosteroid treatment also induces healing.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The protective effect of the oral contraceptive pill on rheumatoid arthritis: an overview of the analytic epidemiological studies using meta-analysis. The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) has been implicated as having a protective effect on the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The results of 12 studies have now been reported and produced differing results and conclusions. Because of the discrepancy in results and the importance of the issue we undertook a review of the studies and performed a meta-analysis. In all, 9 independent studies satisfied the criteria for selection, 6 case-control design and 3 longitudinal. Using standard meta-analysis techniques, the overall pooled odds ratio for all the studies was 0.68 for the crude results (95% CI 0.58-0.78) and 0.73 for the adjusted results (95% CI 0.61-0.85). The graphical odd-man-out method produced a 94% interval of 0.70-0.72. The pooled odds ratio of the case-control studies was lower than for the longitudinal studies. However, subdividing studies by the type of case source produced a pooled odds ratio for studies using hospital-based cases of 0.49 (95% CI 0.39-0.63) which was considerably less than that of studies using population-based cases: 0.95 (0.78-1.16). This difference was unlikely to have explained by bias due to selection of controls. We suggest that OCP use may not have a ""protective effect"" on the development of RA but may prevent the progression to severe disease by modifying the disease process.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Ankle arthrodesis using internal screw fixation. Ankle arthrodesis treated by external fixation frequently results in complications from pin tract infections, loss of position, nonunion, and malunion. A method of ankle arthrodesis using 6.5-mm cancellous screws as the primary fixation hardware was developed. The most important screw is placed from the posterior malleolus into the neck and head of the talus, and medial and lateral malleolar screws are added to secure fixation. Near-normal anatomy is maintained with this technique because little or no bone, only cartilage, is removed. Earlier cases were all done through an anterior approach. Later, special techniques were developed for placing screws and strain-relieving bone grafting was added to promote union. Twenty-three cases that were treated by the earlier technique are reviewed. The overall fusion rate was 74%. Three conditions (avascular talus, pyarthrosis, and spasticity) were identified that placed patients at high risk for failure of fusion. Of the patients who were not in a high-risk group, only one had a delayed union. When the high-risk patients were not included in the statistics, the fusion rate was 93%. The evolved technique shows great promise for accurate and trouble-free ankle arthrodesis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Abnormalities in epidermal lipid metabolism in patients with atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by dryness and itch of the skin. In this study, we measured the phospholipid content and the fatty acid pattern of lesional and lesion-free epidermal keratome biopsies on 15 patients. For comparison, epidermal biopsies were obtained from healthy individuals undergoing plastic surgery. The phospholipid content of atopic epidermis was nearly twice as high as in healthy epidermis. Monounsaturated fatty acids in the phosphoglycerides were significantly increased (p less than 0.001) and n-6 fatty acids were significantly decreased (p less than 0.001) in lesional atopic epidermis compared to lesion-free epidermis. The content of esterified arachidonic acid in phosphatidylcholine from lesional epidermis was only 49% of that found in healthy epidermis (p less than 0.001). The content of free arachidonic acid was 47% higher (p less than 0.05), whereas the content of free long-chain saturated fatty acids was decreased by 29% (p less than 0.01), in lesional compared to lesion-free atopic epidermis. The disease severity, calculated as an arbitrary index, correlated inversely with the n-6 fatty acid content of lesion-free atopic epidermis (r = -0.89, p less than 0.001). Our findings suggest that atopic epidermis is characterized by an increased activity of phospholipase A2 and an incomplete transformation of phospholipids into other lipid classes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"The abdomen, thigh, and arm as sites for subcutaneous sodium heparin injections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three subcutaneous injection sites for low-dose heparin therapy (5,000 units). One hundred and one subjects were randomly placed in one of three groups. Group A received injections in the abdomen, Group B, in the thigh, and Group C in the arm. Each subject received three injections at the one site. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was measured prior to initiation of heparin and again four hours after the first injection. Bruising was measured at 48, 60, and 72 hours postinjection. There were no statistically significant differences among groups for either changes in APTT or bruising at 60 and 72 hours postinjection. Thus the clinical practice of utilizing the abdomen as the only or preferred site for subcutaneous heparin injections was not supported.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The role of histamine in allergic diseases. Histamine, which is stored mainly in mast cells and basophils, is a prominent contributor to allergic disease. Elevations in plasma or tissue histamine levels have been noted during anaphylaxis and experimental allergic responses of the skin, nose, and airways. Of the four cardinal signs of asthma (bronchospasm, edema, inflammation, and mucus secretion), histamine is capable of mediating the first two through its H1 receptor and mucus secretion through its H2 receptor. Of the five cardinal signs of allergic rhinitis (pruritus, mucosal edema, sneezing, mucus secretion, and late-phase inflammatory reactions), histamine is capable of mediating the first three through its H1 receptor. In the nose, mucus secretion can be reflexively mediated by H1 and possibly also by H2 receptors. In the skin the cardinal features of urticaria (vasodilation, vascular permeability, and pruritus) can be mediated by stimulation of the H1 receptor. In anaphylaxis histamine H1-receptor stimulation can mediate vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and tachycardia, whereas H2-receptor stimulation can mediate mucus secretion. Stimulation of both receptors can mediate vasodilation and reduce peripheral vascular resistance. Thus although histamine is only one of many mediators of allergic disease, it plays a primary role in allergic rhinitis, urticaria, anaphylaxis, and to a lesser degree, asthma.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Tretinoin accelerates healing after trichloroacetic acid chemical peel. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective, randomized study to assess the effects of tretinoin pretreatment on healing after trichloroacetic acid (TCA) chemical peel. Sixteen male patients (mean age, 67 years) with actinically damaged skin were treated daily with 0.1% tretinoin and placebo creams to the left and right halves of the face and the left and right forearms and hands, respectively, for 14 days prior to the 35% TCA peel. We subjectively noted that during the peel, ""frosting"" was more pronounced and uniform and occurred earlier in tretinoin-pretreated skin in 94% of the patients. Healed skin was measured planimetrically, and the healed area was determined with point stereology. Regardless of pretreatment, the face healed twice as fast as the forearm or hand. In all regions, the mean area healed was significantly greater in skin that had been pretreated with tretinoin. The differences between tretinoin and placebo, respectively, in healed skin were maximal after 5 days for the face (68% vs 52%), after 11 days for the forearms (72% vs 24%), and after 9 days for the hands (61% vs 29%). After 7 days, 75% of the tretinoin-pretreated hemifaces were completely healed, as opposed to 31% of the placebo-pretreated hemifaces. By visual inspection, we could not appreciate a cosmetic difference between tretinoin- and placebo-pretreated skin 2 weeks and 3 months after the TCA peel. We conclude that 0.1% tretinoin pretreatment for 2 weeks prior to the TCA peel will significantly speed healing, which may result in greater patient satisfaction. Patients presently being treated with tretinoin who later undergo a TCA peel might be expected to have similar results.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Chronic dermal ulcer healing enhanced with monophasic pulsed electrical stimulation. The purposes of this randomized, double-blind, multicenter study were to compare healing of chronic dermal ulcers treated with pulsed electrical stimulation with healing of similar wounds treated with sham electrical stimulation and to evaluate patient tolerance to the therapeutic protocol. Forty-seven patients, aged 29 to 91 years, with 50 stage II, III, and IV ulcers were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (n = 26) or a control (sham treatment) group (n = 24). Treated wounds received 30 minutes of pulsed cathodal electrical stimulation twice daily at a pulse frequency of 128 pulses per second (pps) and a peak amplitude of 29.2 mA if the wound contained necrotic tissue or any drainage that was not serosanguinous. A saline-moistened nontreatment electrode was applied 30.5 cm (12 in) cephalad from the wound. This protocol was continued for 3 days after the wound was debrided or exhibited serosanguinous drainage. Thereafter, the polarity of the treatment electrode on the wound was changed every 3 days until the wound progressed to a stage II classification. The pulse frequency was then reduced to 64 pps, and the treatment electrode polarity was changed daily until the wound was healed. Patients in the control group were treated with the same protocol, except they received sham electrical stimulation. After 4 weeks, wounds in the treatment and control groups were 44% and 67% of their initial size, respectively. The healing rates per week for the treatment and control groups were 14% and 8.25%, respectively. The results of this study indicate that pulsed electrical stimulation has a beneficial effect on healing stage II, III, and IV chronic dermal ulcers.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Molecular defect in siblings with prolidase deficiency and absence or presence of clinical symptoms. A 0.8-kb deletion with breakpoints at the short, direct repeat in the PEPD gene and synthesis of abnormal messenger RNA and inactive polypeptide. Prolidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with highly variable symptoms, including mental retardation, skin lesions, and abnormalities of collagenous tissues. In Japanese female siblings with polypeptide negative prolidase deficiency, and with different degrees of severity of skin lesions, we noted an abnormal mRNA with skipping of 192 bp sequence corresponding to exon 14 in lymphoblastoid cells taken from these patients. Transfection and expression analyses using the mutant prolidase cDNA revealed that a mutant protein translated from the abnormal mRNA had an Mr of 49,000 and was enzymatically inactive. A 774-bp deletion, including exon 14 was noted in the prolidase gene. The deletion had termini within short, direct repeats ranging in size of 7 bp (CCACCCT). The ""slipped mispairing"" mechanism may predominate in the generation of the deletion at this locus. This mutation caused a 192-bp in-frame deletion of prolidase mRNA and was inherited from the consanguineous parents. The same mutation caused a different degree of clinical phenotype of prolidase deficiency in this family, therefore factor(s) not related to the PEPD gene product also contribute to development of the clinical symptoms. Identification of mutations in the PEPD gene from subjects with prolidase deficiency provides further insight into the physiological role and structure-function relationship of this biologically important enzyme.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Occupational allergic contact dermatitis caused by nitroglycerin. Irritant contact dermatitis caused by occupational contact with nitroglycerin has been known since the end of the last century. Nitroglycerin is an allergen, and the transdermal drug delivery systems for nitroglycerin recently used to treat angina pectoris have sensitized. 4 patients with allergic contact dermatitis caused by nitroglycerin from explosives are described, and 1 patient who was sensitized by transdermal nitroplaster. On patch testing, dynamite and/or the explosive components nitroglycerin, ethylene glycol dinitrate and dinitrotoluene gave allergic reactions. The following concentrations and vehicles are suggested for patch testing: nitroglycerin 0.5-2% pet., dinitrotoluene and ethylene glycol dinitrate 0.1-0.5% pet. Persons exposed to nitroglycerin at work should try to avoid skin contact by using protective gloves.

"Prevalence of anti-HCV in Norwegian blood donors with anti-HBc or increased ALT levels. Testing for hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc) was performed in 12,104 consecutive blood donors, 139 (1.15%) of whom were found to be positive. The first 6036 donors were also screened for ALT; 91 (1.51%) had repeatedly elevated values. ALT screening was of no help in detecting anti-HBc-positive donors. Those with anti-HBc or repeatedly raised ALT levels were further tested for hepatitis C virus antibodies (anti-HCV), and 3 (2.16%) and 1 (1.10%) anti-HCV-positive donors were detected, respectively. This prevalence of anti-HCV (0.5%) is not significantly different from that found in 1000 unselected donors at our blood bank. Testing for ALT and anti-HBc as surrogate markers for hepatitis C is therefore not recommended in Norwegian blood donors and should be replaced by anti-HCV screening.",Virus_Diseases
"Significance of CSF immunoglobulins in monitoring neurologic disease activity in Behcet's disease. We examined the intrathecal production of immunoglobulins (Ig) G, A, and M in 16 patients with Behcet's disease, 13 of whom have CNS involvement, and in 40 neurologic controls. Oligoclonal IgA and IgM bands were mainly detected in CSF samples from patients with active neuro-Behcet's disease and were documented to disappear when neurologic manifestations remit. Oligoclonal IgG bands, however, were not related to disease activity and were also found in some neurologic controls. High immunoglobulin index values were detected in both active and quiescent diseases and were high in some patients with impaired blood-CSF barriers. The study presented here demonstrates that CSF oligoclonal IgA and IgM may be helpful in monitoring CNS disease activity in neuro-Behcet's and could be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Transmetatarsal amputation: the role of adjunctive revascularization. Over a 12-year period, 160 transmetatarsal amputations were performed in patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease. The following groups were defined: group 1 - nonreconstructable disease (n = 40); group 2 - transmetatarsal amputation in conjunction with distal revascularization (n = 99); group 3 - reconstructable disease but transmetatarsal amputation performed without simultaneous revascularization (n = 21). There were nine early deaths in the entire series, for an operative mortality rate of 5.6%. The lowest rate of transmetatarsal amputation healing (24%) occurred in group 1. An 86% healing rate was achieved in group 3, but in seven cases (33%) some type of revascularization was required within 3 months of the amputation. In group 2 the healing rate was 62% but reached 83% where the bypass remained patent for at least 3 months after the amputation. Long-term patency rates also affected healing. Healing was not influenced by the number of local procedures (single vs multiple). The presence of severe infection or extensive necrosis necessitated open transmetatarsal amputation in 89 cases; the remaining 71 amputations involved primary closure. Since many patients were treated at a time when diagnostic modalities as well as the operative indications and techniques differed somewhat from the current practice, much of the information regarding group I patients in particular should be considered as a negative historical control and any conclusion from our data should be adjusted accordingly. Healing after amputation at the transmetatarsal level can be expected in the majority of instances in which revascularization can be performed with predictable patency, even when the standard criteria for performing such amputations are liberalized.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Inability to interpret toxic salicylate levels in patients taking aspirin and diflunisal. Diflunisal, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, is not metabolized to the free salicylate moiety, but yields serum salicylate levels. We describe 2 patients who unexpectedly had toxic range serum salicylate levels while taking diflunisal and aspirin for rheumatoid arthritis. Diflunisal is measured by standard salicylate assays, a fact not widely appreciated. Serum salicylate levels by these assays cannot be used to determine salicylate toxicity when a patient is taking both aspirin and diflunisal. High pressure liquid chromatography can be used to distinguish true salicylate toxicity from interference with diflunisal.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Nebulized albuterol in acute bronchiolitis. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 40 infants between 6 weeks and 24 months of age who had a first episode of wheezing and other signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis were randomly assigned to receive either nebulized albuterol (0.15 mg/kg/dose) or placebo (saline solution) for two administrations 1 hour apart. The albuterol therapy resulted in a significantly greater improvement in the accessory muscle score (decreases 0.70 vs decreases 0.30; p = 0.03), oxygen saturation (increases 0.71% vs decreases 0.47%; p = 0.01) after one dose, and in the accessory muscle score (decreases 0.86 vs decreases 0.37; p = 0.02), respiratory rate (decreases 19.6% vs decreases 8.0%; p = 0.016), and oxygen saturation (increases 0.76% vs decreases 0.79%; p = 0.015) after two doses of the drug. The response to therapy was similar in infants younger and those older than 6 months of age. The heart rate rose slightly more in the albuterol group (increases 7.76 from baseline) versus the placebo group (decreases 6.79). There were no other side effects of the treatment. Of the 34 children from whom nasal specimens were obtained by swab for viral identification, 24 had positive test results (21 for respiratory syncytial virus, 1 for parainfluenza, 1 for paramyxovirus, and 1 for influenza A).

"Serum antibodies against respiratory tract viruses in episodes of acute otitis media. Although the findings of epidemiological studies have suggested viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) to be crucially involved in the development of acute otitis media (AOM), the relationship between AOM and viral RTI remains unclear. Serum samples, obtained in the acute and convalescent phases of 57 AOM episodes (in 35 children during the first three years of life) were analysed for IgG antibodies against influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus and adenoviruses. One third of the AOM episodes (18/57) could be related to viral RTI, as evidenced by significant increases in viral serum antibody activity. Treatment failure occurred in four AOM episodes where increases in serum viral antibody activity were noted. In three of these failures, antibiotic treatment was unsuccessful despite the bacterial strains not being resistant to the drug used. This suggests that concomitant viral infection may be a determinant of treatment outcome in some AOM episodes.",Virus_Diseases

T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder, a syndrome of T-cell lymphocytosis with neutropenia has been described in patients with various autoimmune disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis. We report a case of T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder occurring in a 42-year-old white woman with a long history of dermatitis herpetiformis and subsequent development of Coomb's positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia and polymyositis. The peripheral blood lymphocytes showed the T-suppressor cell phenotype (CD2-, CD3-, CD8-, and CD4-). DNA analysis of the peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed a T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangement and an immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement.

"Enteroviral RNA sequences detected by polymerase chain reaction in muscle of patients with postviral fatigue syndrome  OBJECTIVE--To determine the presence of enteroviral sequences in muscle of patients with the postviral fatigue syndrome. DESIGN--Detection of sequences with the polymerase chain reaction in a well defined group of patients with the syndrome and controls over the same period. SETTING--Institute of Neurological Sciences, Glasgow. SUBJECTS--60 consecutive patients admitted to the institute with the postviral fatigue syndrome who had undergone extensive investigation to exclude other conditions. 41 controls from the same catchment area without evidence of fatigue, all undergoing routine surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Routine investigations, serological screen for antibodies to a range of viruses, and presence of enteroviral RNA sequences in muscle biopsy specimens. RESULTS--15 (25%) patients and 10 (24.4%) controls had important serological findings. 12 patients had neutralising antibody titres of greater than or equal to 256 to coxsackieviruses B1-5 (six positive for enteroviral RNA sequences, six negative); three were positive for Epstein-Barr virus specific IgM (two positive, one negative). Six controls had similar neutralising antibody titres to coxsackieviruses (all negative); one was positive for Epstein-Barr virus specific IgM (negative); and three had titres of complement fixing antibody greater than or equal to 256 to cytomegalovirus (all negative). Overall, significantly more patients than controls had enteroviral RNA sequences in muscle (32/60, 53% v 6/41, 15%; odds ratio 6.7, 95% confidence interval 2.4 to 18.2). This was not correlated with duration of disease, patient and age, or to raised titres of antibodies to coxsackieviruses B1-5.

"Paraneoplastic pemphigus. An autoimmune mucocutaneous disease associated with neoplasia. BACKGROUND and METHODS. We describe five patients with underlying neoplasms in whom painful mucosal ulcerations and polymorphous skin lesions developed, usually with progression to blistering eruptions on the trunk and extremities. Histologic examination showed vacuolization of epidermal basal cells, keratinocyte necrosis, and acantholysis. Immunofluorescence testing revealed atypical pemphigus-like autoantibodies in perilesional epithelium and serum from all five patients. We studied the antigenic specificities of the autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using extracts of 14C-labeled human keratinocytes. IgG purified from the serum of one patient was passively transferred to four neonatal mice to test for pathogenicity. RESULTS. Immunofluorescence testing showed that the autoantibodies bound to the surface of tissues containing desmosomes, including complex and simple epithelia, and myocardium. An identical and unique complex of four polypeptides with molecular weights of 250, 230, 210, and 190 was immunoprecipitated by all serum samples. The 250-kd polypeptide comigrated with desmoplakin I (a protein found in the desmosomes of all epithelia), and the 230-kd antigen comigrated with the antigen of bullous pemphigoid. Cutaneous blisters, a positive Nikolsky's sign, and epidermal and esophageal acantholysis developed in all mice into which the autoantibody was injected. Electron microscopy showed epidermal acantholysis similar to lesions of experimentally induced pemphigus vulgaris. CONCLUSION. These five patients with cancer had a novel acantholytic mucocutaneous disease characterized by autoantibodies that were pathogenic after passive transfer. The autoantibodies from these patients reacted with an antigen complex composed of desmoplakin I and the 230-kd antigen of bullous pemphigoid and two as yet unidentified epithelial antigens.

"The role of antihistamines in otitis. Chronic and recurrent otitis media can manifest as otitis media with effusion. Both infection and eustachian tube obstruction (ETO) have been found to play an important role in its pathogenesis. ETO can be demonstrated during both early- and late-phase reactions in patients with allergic rhinitis after intranasal challenge with an allergen. Intranasal challenge with either histamine or prostaglandin D2 also provokes ETO, with the latter mediator perhaps more potent than the former. Middle ear effusions from patients with chronic or recurrent otitis media have been found to contain dramatically increased concentrations of histamine relative to the concentrations in their plasma. The development of nasal and eustachian tube obstruction in allergic rhinitis patients has been prevented by pretreatment with an antihistamine plus decongestant before intranasal challenge with pollen allergen. Investigations are currently under way to assess the effect of antihistamine pretreatment on nasal and eustachian tube obstruction in patients undergoing intranasal histamine challenge.",Virus_Diseases

Anti-HCV was detected in 65% of 132 patients with HCC, without any relationship with the presence of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The prevalence (74%) of anti-HCV was high, as expected in patients with putative non-A, non-B cirrhosis also. The prevalence of anti-HCV was less in patients with HBsAg-positive cirrhosis (28%) and in patients with disease not related to viral hepatitis and healthy controls (8%).

"Longitudinal study of 94 symptomatic infants with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection. Evidence for a bimodal expression of clinical and biological symptoms. To better define the clinical and biological evolution of infants after vertical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, we analyzed 94 consecutive infected patients followed up after their first clinical symptoms. The expression of clinical symptoms and biological abnormalities followed a bimodal distribution, some patients having an early and severe disease and the others having a slowly progressive one. One third of our patients suffered from early onset of opportunistic infection (OI). These patients had a significantly higher incidence of severe encephalopathy compared with patients without OI. The rate of survival at 3 years was 48% +/- 24%. In contrast, the patients without early OI or severe encephalopathy had a probability of survival at 3 years of 97% +/- 3%. This probability was not modified by the occurrence of bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis occurred at a mean age of 29 months, significantly later than OI or severe encephalopathy. Laboratory results at initial examination were correlated with clinical symptoms. Thus, when the number of CD4 lymphocytes was less than 500/mm3, children suffered more frequently from life-threatening symptoms (OI and severe encephalopathy): 15 of 22 vs 14 of 69. The same was true when the lymphocytes did not proliferate after antigenic stimulation, when anti-p18 and/or anti-p25 antibodies were absent in the serum, and when p24 antigen was detected in serum. Finally, severe encephalopathy was associated with low anti-human immunodeficiency virus cerebrospinal fluid antibody titer, whereas 88% of patients with moderate or no encephalopathy had signs of intrathecal anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody synthesis. In conclusion, a subgroup of patients expressed very early signs of severe immunodeficiency and encephalopathy, whereas the majority of patients had a longer survival and less severe clinical symptoms during their first years of life than previously thought.",Virus_Diseases
"Tumor necrosis factor alpha in middle ear cholesteatoma and its effect on keratinocytes in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was found in human middle ear cholesteatoma tissues by the immunoperoxidase method using rabbit anti human TNF-alpha immunoglobulin G. It appeared to be localized in the epithelium and connective tissue of cholesteatomas studied, particularly on basal and spinous cells, and macrophages. The epithelium of normal external ear canal skin was lightly stained, but the staining was much weaker than that of the cholesteatomas observed. In vitro, recombinant mouse TNF-alpha stimulated proliferation, protein synthesis, and terminal differentiation of basal keratinocytes. These stimulatory effects were blocked by the anti-TNF-alpha immunoglobulin G, which by itself had no effect on basal keratinocytes.

The extent of latent HIV-1 infection in blood T cells and monocytes of 23 seropositive individuals was examined using DNA amplification (PCR) of HIV-1 sequences. Amplified DNA was found in at least one cell type in all seropositives tested, including 13 asymptomatic, 5 ARC, and 5 AIDS patients. Amplification with two or more primer sets from the gag, env, LTR occurred in 21 (91%) patients' T cells and 17 (74%) patients' monocytes. However, amplification with the LTR primers in monocytes was uncommon. Among four patients tested, amplified DNA continued to be detected after a greater than one thousand-fold dilution (less than 500 cells) of both T cell and monocyte lysates. Repeat analysis after 7-9 mo in five seropositives yielded similar findings in T cells and monocytes, but some variation in the efficacy of amplification with individual primers occurred. There was no difference in those 10 patients who were taking AZT, compared to those who were untreated. Our results indicate that a fraction (less than 1%) of both T cells and monocytes in blood carry a latent infection in all stages of HIV-1 disease and can serve as reservoirs throughout AZT therapy.",Virus_Diseases
"The measles epidemic. The problems, barriers, and recommendations. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee. The nation has experienced a marked increase in measles cases during 1989 and 1990. Almost one half of all cases have occurred in unvaccinated preschool children, mostly minorities. The principal cause for the epidemic is failure to provide vaccine to vulnerable children on schedule. Major reasons for the low vaccine coverage exist within the health care system itself, which creates barriers to obtaining immunization and fails to take advantage of many opportunities to provide vaccines to children. Ideally, immunizations should be given as part of a comprehensive child health care program. However, immunization cannot await the development of such an ideal system. Essential changes can and should be made now. Specific recommendations include improved availability of immunization; improved management of immunization services; improved capacity to measure childhood immunization status; implementation of the two-dose measles vaccine strategy; and laboratory, epidemiologic, and operational studies to further define the determinants of decreased vaccine coverage and to develop new combinations of vaccines that can be administered earlier in life. The measles epidemic may be a warning flag of problems with our system of primary health care.",Virus_Diseases
"Autoimmune disease and HTLV-1 infection. We describe two patients who presented with mixed connective tissue disease. Both had antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to the extractable nuclear antigen U1RNP, and both were found to be seropositive for HTLV-1 infection. We found no evidence of HTLV-1 infection in 20 other patients known to have antibodies to U1RNP or in 36 British and West German patients with idiopathic adult polymyositis. In addition the serum from 20 anti-HTLV-1 positive patients did not contain antinuclear antibodies or antibodies to U1RNP. We conclude that rheumatological disease is associated with HTLV-1 through geographical rather than aetiological means.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Preventing cervical cancer by treating genital warts in men. Why male sex partners need androscopy. The increased incidence of cancer of the genitourinary and anorectal areas has been directly related to the coexistence of genital human papillomavirus infection. The diagnosis and treatment of condyloma acuminatum in men is important not only to prevent cancer but also to decrease the reservoir of virus that is being transferred to women. Screening with androscopy (examination of male genitals with a colposcope after a vinegar solution has been applied to the skin) is indicated for all men who are at risk for this infection. Treatment options include chemical application, cryosurgery, laser therapy, and interferon injections. To be effective, treatment must include both sexual partners.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The significance of Leu 8 negative T cells in lymphoid skin infiltrates: malignant transformation, selective homing or T-cell activation? The expression of Leu 8 was studied on skin biopsies from a large group of patients with benign and malignant skin disorders and correlated with the expression of T-cell differentiation antigens and activation markers. The effect of in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood T cells and T-cell subsets on the expression of Leu 8 antigen was also determined. In all the skin diseases studied an inverse relationship was found between the proportions of cells expressing Leu 8 and HLA-DR. A deficiency of Leu 8 positive cells was not specific for mycosis fungoides, but was also found in several reactive dermatoses. Stimulation of peripheral blood cells with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and anti-CD3-PMA resulted in a considerable decrease of Leu 8 antigen expression on day 3 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These data suggest that the low proportion of Leu 8+ T cells in mycosis fungoides and several reactive skin disorders is not related to malignant transformation or selective homing of Leu 8- T cells, but probably results from local T-cell activation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in defense against herpes simplex virus infections. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to cells infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a mechanism of destruction of these cells by a combination of antiviral antibody and immunoglobulin Fc receptor-positive leukocytes. It has been well defined in vitro as a rapid lytic response utilizing minute amounts of IgG antibody. In vitro studies have shown ADCC restriction of the spread of virus. In vivo studies using adoptive transfer of human or murine ADCC effector cells plus antibody and ADCC-active, nonneutralizing F(ab1)2 antibody fragments or monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated the important role of this response in animal models of HSV infection. In humans, ADCC effector function and/or antibody levels have been associated with the outcome of infection, especially in immunocompromised patients and neonates. Reconstitution of this mechanism with appropriate antibodies or cytokines in high-risk hosts, with the resultant amelioration of severe HSV infection, will validate ADCC as a critical component of antiviral defense.",Virus_Diseases
"Irradiation of protoporphyric mice induces down-regulation of epidermal eicosanoid metabolism. This study investigated the effect of radiation on clinical and histologic changes, and on cutaneous eicosanoid metabolism, in Skh:HR-1 hairless albino mice rendered protoporphyric by the administration of collidine. At 0.1-18 h after exposure to 12 kJ/m2 of 396-406 nm irradiation, thicknesses of back skin and ears were measured, and histologic changes were evaluated by using hematoxylin and eosin (H-E) and Giemsa's stains. Activities of eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes in epidermal and dermal homogenates were assessed by incubating the tissue homogenates with 3H-AA, followed by quantitation of the eicosanoids generated by radio-TLC. In irradiated protoporphyric mice, an increase of back-skin thickness was noted at 0.1 h, reaching a peak at 18 h, whereas maximal increase in ear thickness was observed at 12 h. Histologic changes included dermal edema, increased mast cell degranulation, and mononuclear cells in the dermis. In these irradiated protoporphyric animals, generations of 6 keto-PGF1a, PGF2a, PGE2, PGD2, and HETE by epidermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes were markedly suppressed at all the timepoints studied. Dermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes of irradiated protoporphyric mice generated increased amounts of PGE2 and HETE at 18 h, probably reflecting the presence of dermal cellular infiltrates. The suppression of the activities of epidermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes was prevented by intraperitoneal injection of WR-2721, a sulfhydryl group generator, prior to irradiation, suggesting that the suppression was secondary to photo-oxidative damage of the enzymes during the in vivo phototoxic response. These results suggest that the effect of protoporphyrin and radiation on cutaneous eicosanoid metabolism in this animal model in vivo is that of a down regulation of the activities of epidermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Condylomata acuminata in children: frequent association with human papillomaviruses responsible for cutaneous warts. To identify the papillomavirus types associated with condylomata acuminata in children and to evaluate their mode of transmission, we studied 32 children with anogenital warts. External condylomata were found in 12 of their mothers and in 10 of their fathers. Ten mothers, including two without external lesions, had cervical condylomata. Blot hybridization studies disclosed a genital human papillomavirus (HPV) in 14 of 27 children (HPV-6 in 12 and HPV-11 in two) and in 8 of 14 patients (HPV-6 in all). HPV-6 was found in another child by the polymerase chain reaction technique. Infection occurred most likely at birth or from nonsexual contact, but sexual abuse could not be excluded in one 11-year-old girl. Cutaneous HPV-2 was found in seven children and as yet uncharacterized papillomaviruses were found in two children. Three mothers of HPV-2-infected children had common hand warts, and two children had subungual warts. This study shows the frequent nonsexual transmission of genital papillomaviruses in children and the unexpectedly high association of children's condylomata with papillomaviruses responsible for skin warts, possibly transmitted by heteroinoculation or autoinoculation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Linear IgA disease of adults: association with lymphoproliferative malignancy and possible role of other triggering factors. Seventy patients with linear IgA disease of adults were followed up for a mean of 8.5 years and all malignant diseases in this group were ascertained. There were three cases of lymphoproliferative malignancy, which constituted a significant excess over the 0.2 cases that would be expected by comparison with an age- and sex-matched population using National Cancer Registry statistics. In contrast, the non-lymphoid malignancy rate of 13% is almost identical to the expected 14%. A subgroup of 35 of the adult linear IgA disease patients were assessed with respect to the possible precipitating illnesses or drugs, as well as co-existing medical conditions. Almost one-third of patients described an event that was felt could possibly have triggered the linear IgA disease, the most frequent being non-steroidal anti-inflammatory or antibiotic drug therapy, trauma/burns and upper respiratory tract infections. However, it is difficult to determine how often the preceding event is coincidental, and how often, if at all, it is causal.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Interrater reliability of videotaped observational gait-analysis assessments. The purpose of this study was to determine the interrater reliability of videotaped observational gait-analysis (VOGA) assessments. Fifty-four licensed physical therapists with varying amounts of clinical experience served as raters. Three patients with rheumatoid arthritis who demonstrated an abnormal gait pattern served as subjects for the videotape. The raters analyzed each patient's most severely involved knee during the four subphases of stance for the kinematic variables of knee flexion and genu valgum. Raters were asked to determine whether these variables were inadequate, normal, or excessive. The temporospatial variables analyzed throughout the entire gait cycle were cadence, step length, stride length, stance time, and step width. Generalized kappa coefficients ranged from .11 to .52. Intraclass correlation coefficients (2,1) and (3,1) were slightly higher. Our results indicate that physical therapists' VOGA assessments are only slightly to moderately reliable and that improved interrater reliability of the assessments of physical therapists utilizing this technique is needed. Our data suggest that there is a need for greater standardization of gait-analysis training.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis: effects on disease activity in a multicenter prospective study. One hundred and twenty-three patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who successfully completed a randomized trial comparing oral methotrexate (MTX) to auranofin enrolled in a longterm prospective study of oral MTX. Of the 91 patients who completed 24 months of therapy, a significant (p = 0.0001) improvement was noted compared to baseline in all clinical disease variables and the Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Marked improvement occurred in 94 (76%) and 98 (80%) of the patients in the joint pain/tenderness index and joint swelling index at the last evaluable visit (mean 26 months). Of the 77 patients with an elevated ESR at baseline, 29 (38%) patients normalized it (less than 20 mm/h) while receiving therapy (p less than 0.01). A significant reduction in prednisone dose was also seen. Adverse events occurred frequently but were generally mild in severity. Twenty-seven patients (22%) withdrew during the study. Four (3%) withdrew due to lack of efficacy, and 6 (5%) because of adverse experiences. The overall probability of continuing therapy in the study for 48 months was projected at 72%.

"Drug prophylaxis for human immunodeficiency virus-infected pregnant women: ethical considerations. More than 5000 women infected with human immunodeficiency virus give birth annually in the United States. Many of these women are offered human immunodeficiency virus tests in prenatal settings. One of the incentives for them to be tested is access to medications that have been shown to prolong disease-free intervals in nonpregnant human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals. However, the use of those medications during pregnancy has not been well studied and some have cautioned against their prenatal use. Thus consideration of these agents may be deferred by some clinicians until the postpartum period. In this article we argue that the availability of such agents should be disclosed to women who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus as part of the informed consent process.",Virus_Diseases

Successful immunization of infants at 6 months of age with high dose Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine. Cite Soleil/JHU Project Team. A group of 2097 Haitian infants 6 to 11 months of age were randomized to receive Schwarz or Edmonston-Zagreb strain measles vaccines containing 10- to 500-fold more vaccine viral particles than standard potency vaccines. No unusual adverse reactions were noted. Edmonston-Zagreb vaccines were more effective than equivalent doses of Schwarz vaccines as measured by the proportion of vaccinated children with measles antibody concentrations greater than or equal to 200 mIU/ml 2 months after vaccination and the persistence of antibody at 18 to 24 months of age. High titer Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine administered at 6 months of age induced antibody concentrations greater than or equal to 200 mIU/ml in 83% of infants by plaque reduction neutralization and 93% of infants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with high rates of antibody persistence at 12 to 24 months of age.

"Skin acceptance of transcutaneous nitroglycerin patches: a prospective study of 33 patients. Transdermal nitroglycerin is commonly used and may induce contact dermatitis. The frequency of adverse skin reactions is controversial and may vary from 10% to 75%, according to various authors. 33 patients using transdermal nitroglycerin for more than 7 days were examined and patch tested (nitroglycerin 0.5% aq., 2% pet. and TTS in toto). 5 patients (15%) had adverse reactions. The patch tests were all negative in the 33 patients. Contact dermatitis occurs in many cases, about 15% of the cases with the newly available TTS, and even if patients respect the conditions for using TTS. These contact dermatitides are mainly irritant reactions and do not require transdermal nitroglycerin treatment to be stopped. Nevertheless, since some cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported, a contact dermatitis from transdermal nitroglycerin should lead to patch testing.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase: a splice site mutation causes the deletion of exon 6 in multiple families with porphyria cutanea tarda. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) is a cytosolic heme-biosynthetic enzyme that converts uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen. Defects at the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase locus cause the human genetic disease familial porphyria cutanea tarda. A splice site mutation has been found in a pedigree with familial porphyria cutanea tarda that causes exon 6 to be deleted from the mRNA. The intron/exon junctions on either side of exon 6 fall between codons, so the resulting protein is shorter than the normal protein, missing only the amino acids coded by exon 6. The shortened protein lacks catalytic activity, is rapidly degraded when exposed to human lymphocyte lysates, and is not detectable by Western blot analysis in lymphocyte lysates derived from affected individuals. The mutation was detected in five of 22 unrelated familial porphyria cutanea tarda pedigrees tested, so it appears to be common. This is the first splice site mutation to be found at the URO-D locus, and the first mutation that causes familial porphyria cutanea tarda to be found in more than one pedigree.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Topical exposure of mice to 0.5% potassium dichromate in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) under occlusion resulted in specific contact sensitization in each of 7 experiments. Although sensitization to nickel sulphate under the same conditions was weak and somewhat variable, evidence for significant levels of contact allergy was obtained in 4 of 7 experiments. In addition, repeated topical application of both nickel sulphate and potassium dichromate in DMSO was found to result in the induction of lymphocyte proliferative responses in lymph nodes draining the site of exposure.

"Expression of a cell adhesion protein (VLA beta) in normal and diseased skin. Biopsies from normal skin (n = 17) and various cutaneous disorders (n = 83) were examined immunohistologically for reactivity with an antibody (CD29) against the common beta chain of the VLA integrin family. In normal skin, CD29 recognized a number of cell types, i.e. endothelial cells, fibroblasts, T lymphocytes and basal keratinocytes. Similar cells were positive in diseased skin, but the expression of VLA beta was upregulated on keratinocytes. The phenotype of the VLA beta-positive T cells was examined in more detail by staining with anti-T-cell antibodies, i.e. CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO (UCHL1) and CD45R (2H4). These studies showed that most of the T cells in normal skin, benign cutaneous conditions and early cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) expressed a similar phenotype and resembled antigen committed 'memory' (helper/inducer) cells (CD4+, CD29+, CD45RO+, CD45R-). In advanced CTCL, expression of these antigens was more variable, and many of these infiltrates showed aberrant (or unusual) expression of CD29, CD45RO, CD45R and other T-cell antigens. It is concluded that several cells involved in cutaneous immune reactions express a molecule (VLA beta) which acts as a receptor for extracellular matrix components. This molecule is important for the attachment of cells to connective tissue constituents and may act to facilitate the migration of lymphocytes (and other cells) during immune reactions in normal and diseased cutaneous conditions. Advanced CTCL differ from the early lesions and it is possible that there is a progressive accumulation of increasingly malignant (or transformed) cells in these conditions.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

Commercial biotinylated DNA probes specific for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11; 16 and 18; and 31, 33, and 35 were used for in situ hybridization analysis of 105 oral mucosal specimens from 5 cases of verruca vulgaris, 15 cases of condyloma acuminatum, 30 cases of squamous papilloma, 20 cases of hyperkeratosis/acanthosis, 15 cases of epithelial dysplasia, 5 cases of carcinoma in situ, and 15 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Positive hybridization signals were found in 26 specimens (24.8%). Only HPV-6/11 was detected. HPV DNA occurred significantly more often (p less than 0.005, chi-square analysis) in condyloma acuminatum (100%) and verruca vulgaris (100%) than squamous papilloma (13.3%), hyperkeratotic/acanthotic lesions (10%), and malignant and premalignant lesions (0%). The tongue (19.1%) and labial epithelium (17.1%) were infected most frequently. Nuclear reaction products indicating HPV infection were associated primarily with koilocytes.

Although tissue factor (TF) is produced by certain tumours, and is increased in both tumour-associated macrophages and blood monocytes, the possibility that it might also be increased in urine has not been studied in patients with cancer. We have measured urinary PCA in hospital controls without inflammatory or neoplastic disease (n = 79), in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 8), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 19), colorectal cancer (n = 70) and in patients undergoing colonoscopy (n = 50). Urinary PCA was higher (P less than 0.001) in patients with colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease than controls or patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Fourteen (88 per cent) out of 16 colonoscopy patients subsequently found to have carcinoma or inflammatory bowel disease had levels above the control upper quartile, compared with 8 (24 per cent) out of 34 with normal colonoscopy (P less than 0.001). TF inhibitors confirmed the nature of the PCA and Western blotting studies indicated a urinary TF molecular weight of approximately 38,000.

"Effect of vaccination on serotype-specific antibody responses in infants administered WC3 bovine rotavirus before or after a natural rotavirus infection. In an evaluation of WC3 bovine rotavirus (serotype 6) vaccine in infants, some subjects experienced a natural serotype 1 rotavirus infection before vaccination and others after. Therefore, the effects of both WC3 and natural rotavirus strains as either primary or boosting immunogens on serotype-specific neutralizing antibody responses could be determined. After primary natural infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic), neutralizing antibody titers were highest to serotype 1 but were consistently high to serotype 3, and low titers (greater than or equal to 20) to serotypes 2 and 4 were often detected. Previous vaccination with WC3 had little effect on the magnitude of these responses. In contrast, subjects infected with serotype 1 strains before vaccination experienced large (average, 12-fold) rises in neutralizing antibody to human serotypes 1-4 when vaccinated with WC3. Thus, although WC3 and the natural strains are distinct serotypes, their epitopes were sufficiently similar that reinfection with WC3 could boost neutralizing antibody titers to human serotypes in subjects primed by a previous natural infection.",Virus_Diseases

"Magnetic resonance imaging of the transverse atlantal ligament for the evaluation of atlantoaxial instability. Twenty normal human subjects and 14 patients with upper cervical spine pathology were studied with axial high-field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to examine the transverse atlantal ligament. Gradient-echo MR imaging pulse sequences provided reliable visualization of the transverse ligament, which exhibited low signal intensity and extended behind the dens between the medial portions of the lateral masses of C-1. The MR imaging characteristics of the transverse ligament were verified in clinical studies and in postmortem specimens. The clinical MR examinations defined 27 normal ligaments, three ligament disruptions, and four stretched rheumatoid ligaments. Atlantoaxial instability associated with transverse ligament rupture or ligamentous laxity required internal fixation. In contrast, fractures of C-1 or C-2 or atlantoaxial rotatory dislocations associated with an intact transverse ligament healed without instability or nonunion. The transverse ligament is the primary stabilizing component of C-1. The treatment of atlantoaxial instability has previously been based on criteria drawn from computerized tomography or plain radiographic studies, which only indirectly assess the probability of rupture of the transverse ligament. It is concluded that MR imaging accurately depicts the anatomical integrity of the transverse ligament. After transverse ligament failure, the remaining ligaments of the craniovertebral junction are inadequate to maintain stability. The presence of ligament disruption should be considered as a criterion for early fusion.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Intravenous anti-D treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura: analysis of efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of effect. The efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of effect of intravenous Anti-D (Winrho) were studied in 43 Rh+ patients with immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) who had not undergone splenectomy and in three already splenectomized patients. The mean platelet increase for the 43 nonsplenectomized patients was 95,000/microL (median 43,000/microL). Children had greater acute platelet responses than did adults. Human immunodeficiency virus status and duration of thrombocytopenia did not affect response. Maintenance treatment was given to patients as needed: the average interval between infusions was 24 days. The three splenectomized patients had no platelet response whatsoever. Toxicity was minimal; infusions were completed in less than 5 minutes. The generally accepted mechanism of effect of Anti-D has been Fc receptor blockade by substitution of antibody-coated red blood cells for antibody-coated platelets. Evidence is presented suggesting that the effect of IV Anti-D is not limited to Fc receptor blockade, including: (1) no correlation of parameters of hemolysis with platelet increase; (2) a 48- to 72-hour delay before platelet increase; (3) a tendency of the change in monocyte Fc receptor I expression to correlate with platelet increase; and (4) increased in vitro production of antibodies to sheep red blood cells following IV Anti-D infusion.",Virus_Diseases
"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against HIV-coated target cells by peripheral blood monocytes from HIV seropositive asymptomatic patients. Cytotoxic effector cells like cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils can lyse directly HIV-infected or HIV-coated cells in the absence or presence of anti-HIV antibodies. Therefore, these cytotoxic mechanisms can be invoked either in the control of HIV infection at early stages of the disease or in the generalized immunosuppression observed at later stages of the disease. The relationship between anti-HIV effector mechanisms and disease, however, remains elusive. The present study investigates in HIV+ seropositive asymptomatic patients peripheral blood monocytes (PBM)-mediated antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HIV-coated target cells in the presence of heterologous or autologous anti-HIV serum. To test for specific ADCC against HIV Ag, a T4+ CEM.TR line resistant to TNF and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity was selected in vitro. ADCC was performed in an 18-h 51Cr-release assay using CEM.TR cells coated with inactivated HIV. Unlike PBM from normal controls, significant ADCC was observed by PBM from HIV+ seropositive patients in the presence of pooled HIV+ antiserum. The ADCC activity was specific for HIV and was dependent on the E:T ratio and the antiserum dilution used. Upon activation of PBM with rIFN-gamma, both normal and HIV+ PBM-mediated ADCC against HIV-coated CEM.TR. Furthermore, ADCC activity by PBM from HIV+ seropositive patients in the presence of their autologous serum was examined. Significant ADCC activity was observed and was dependent on the E:T ratio and serum dilution used. The findings demonstrating anti-HIV ADCC activity by PBM from HIV+ seropositive individuals and their autologous sera support the notion that monocyte-mediated ADCC may be operative in vivo.",Virus_Diseases
"HLA class II and T cell receptor gene polymorphisms in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. HLA-DRB, DQA and DQB genes as well as the T cell receptor (TcR) alpha, beta, and gamma genes were studied by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis alone (Ps). A subtype of DR7, DR7a, was found in 38.8% of patients with PsA, 41.5% of patients with Ps, and in 8% of healthy individuals (N) (PsA vs N: pc = 0.0002, RR = 7.1; Ps vs N: pc = 0.0002, RR = 7.9). No association with TcR genes was found. Our findings suggest either that the DR7a allele may be in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-Cw6 or that it may be an important susceptibility factor for PsA and Ps.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Circadian variations in the superoxide production, enzyme release and neutrophil aggregation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and controls. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience fluctuations of symptoms throughout the day. These could be due to mechanical changes or modification of the inflammatory mechanisms. In the present paper we studied fluctuations of superoxide production (O2), enzyme release (beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme) and neutrophil aggregation in the peripheral blood of eight healthy volunteers and eight patients with RA. Although enzyme release was greater in patients with RA, no significant difference was found throughout the day, neither in control nor in patients. Similar results were obtained when studying neutrophil aggregation. On the contrary, the superoxide production, determined at 8:00, 14:00, and 20:00 h, was 6.3 +/- 0.5, 4.40 +/- 0.4 and 6.26 +/- 0.3, respectively, in patients with RA and 6.65 +/- 0.7, 4.7 +/- 0.7 and 7.27 +/- 0.4 in the controls.

"Marfan syndrome: no evidence for heterogeneity in different populations, and more precise mapping of the gene. Marfan syndrome is a dominantly inherited connective tissue disorder with manifestations in the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. The diagnosis is hampered by both high variability in the phenotypic expression and late manifestation of symptoms. The cause of Marfan syndrome remains unknown, but our group has recently reported the genetic linkage of Marfan syndrome to a polymorphic marker on chromosome 15. To analyze the possible heterogeneity behind Marfan syndrome, we have performed linkage analyses for four chromosome 15 markers in 17 families from five different populations: Scottish, English, Swiss, American, and Finnish. By combining the linkage data of all the studied families into a LINKMAP analysis we obtained a maximal LOD score of 11.2, which maps the Marfan syndrome locus between D15S25 and D15S45 on the long arm of chromosome 15. The data reveal no evidence for genetic heterogeneity behind Marfan syndrome and provide us with a more precise location of both the Marfan syndrome locus and flanking markers. This information will provide the basis for the DNA diagnostics of Marfan syndrome in the future.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Long-term safety and efficacy of zidovudine in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease. Zidovudine Epidemiology Study Group. An epidemiologic study was initiated in 1987 to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of zidovudine in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease. Data from 886 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex and CD4+ lymphocyte count less than 0.25 x 10(9)/L are reported. Eighteen-month survival was 67% for the cohort. Pretreatment factors associated with increased survival time included index diagnosis of AIDS-related complex, hematocrit of 0.35 or greater, CD4+ lymphocyte count of 0.15 x 10(9)/L or greater, high functional status, and time from diagnosis of AIDS to treatment of less than 60 days. By proportional hazards analysis, development of serious anemia was the most significant factor associated with early death. Receiving zidovudine for a high proportion of time significantly improved chances of survival even if anemia developed. Serious leukopenia occurring in 37% and serious anemia occurring in 32% of patients. Nonhematologic adverse events were uncommon and no previously unreported adverse events were seen.",Virus_Diseases

"Early loss of astrocytes in herpes simplex virus-induced central nervous system demyelination. Immunohistochemistry was used to study herpes simplex virus type 1-induced central nervous system demyelination in the trigeminal root entry zone of mice inoculated with herpes simplex virus type 1 by the corneal route. There was no change in peripheral nervous system myelin as shown by immunostaining for Po glycoprotein. Double immunoperoxidase staining for herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens and glial fibrillary acidic protein showed that most of the infected cells were astrocytes. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining was completely lost in the inferior medial portion of the trigeminal root entry zone at 6 days after herpes simplex virus type 1 inoculation, a time when central nervous system myelin was preserved as indicated by immunostaining for myelin basic protein. The pattern of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining did not change and herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens were no longer detected after day 8. There was a progressive loss of myelin basic protein staining within the area unstained by glial fibrillary acidic protein antisera on days 8 to 14. This pattern of astrocyte loss before central nervous system demyelination is strikingly different from the reactive astrocytosis seen in other demyelinating lesions, such as acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or acute multiple sclerosis. Herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in mice provides an unusual model of acute central nervous system demyelination preceded by a loss of astrocytes.",Virus_Diseases

"MY7 monoclonal antibody for diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Infiltrate in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) is composed mainly of CD4 helper cells with a phenotype very similar to that of benign cutaneous lymphoid infiltrate. MY7 (CD13) is a monoclonal antibody that is normally expressed on peripheral granulocytes and monocytes but also cross-reacts with an antigen expressed on epidermal basal cells. We studied MY7 expression on basal cells of the epidermis and CD4 cell infiltrate in 34 CTCLs, 11 pseudolymphomas, and 29 other benign cutaneous lesions. An indirect immunofluorescence technique with double labeling and an immunoperoxidase technique were used. We found that in benign inflammatory infiltrate, less than 10% of CD4 cells expressed MY7 antigen associated with normal MY7 monoclonal antibody labeling of basal cells, whereas in CTCLs more than 50% of CD4 tumoral cells in dermis expressed MY7 antigens; however, basal cells were MY7 negative. Thus, it is demonstrated that MY7 monoclonal antibody with its double modulation on epidermis (basal cells) and dermis (CD4 cells) has diagnostic value for differentiating CTCLs with CD4+ MY7+ tumor cells in dermis and MY7-negative basal cells from benign inflammatory lesions with CD4+ MY7- cells in dermis and MY7-positive basal cells. This modulation of MY7 labeling could be related to the secretion of epidermal cytokines.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Evidence suggesting involvement of interleukin-4 (IL-4) production in spontaneous in vitro IgE synthesis in patients with atopic dermatitis. To investigate the regulatory role of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and their involvement in the abnormality of IgE synthesis in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), we studied the effect of recombinant human IL-4 and INF-gamma, as well as blocking antibodies (Abs) to these lymphokines on spontaneous IgE synthesis by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from patients with AD and from healthy control subjects. PBLs from patients with AD demonstrated elevated spontaneous IgE production that was not stimulated further by the addition of recombinant IL-4, whereas for the healthy control subjects, recombinant IL-4 increased spontaneous IgE production by PBLs. INF-gamma that has been previously demonstrated to antagonize the effect of IL-4 on IgE synthesis, decreased IgE production of patients with AD. Addition of Abs to INF-gamma did not change spontaneous IgE production for patients with AD or for healthy control subjects. Together with our observation that IL-4 Abs lowered the high spontaneous IgE production by PBLs from patients with AD, these results suggest that in AD, IL-4 production by lymphocytes, together with a lack of INF-gamma production, is at least partially responsible for the increased spontaneous IgE production.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The natural history of the clinical and pathologic features of skin disease was reviewed prospectively in 30 patients with the L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Overall, cutaneous manifestations developed in 26 patients (87%). Early lesions were nonspecific and characterized predominantly by an erythematous macular eruption on the trunk and extremities. The most characteristic abnormality noted was the spectrum of sclerodermatous disease in 15 patients (50%) often after a subacute stage of peripheral or truncal edema. Clinical and/or biopsy evidence of eosinophilic fasciitis was seen in nine patients (30%). Findings consistent with diffuse, limited, or localized scleroderma were subsequently observed in nine patients (33%). Small mucinous papules, similar to those seen in scleromyxedema, were found in five patients (17%). Alopecia, frequently a late sequela, developed in 11 (37%). Common histologic features included papillary dermal fibrosis, dermal and fascial infiltrates consisting of mononuclear cells and eosinophils, deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis, and, in some patients, numerous mast cells.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Herpes simplex and human papillomavirus genital infections: controversy over obstetric management. Plasma inhibitory factors, high levels of sex hormones, and depression of cell-mediated immunity may interfere with the natural host resistance to viral infections during pregnancy. It is apparent that hormonal, immunologic, and vascular changes in pregnancy may account for increased replication of herpes and for enhanced growth of condylomatous lesions. The challenge is to develop a rational plan of management for pregnant patients with herpes simplex or human papilloma virus infection. There has been a reevaluation of previous recommendations for the management of herpes in pregnancy. Although the consequences of neonatal infection are severe or fatal, the value of routine weekly screening is questionable. This regimen is a poor predictor of neonatal exposure to herpes since only one fourth of women shedding virus at the time of delivery can be identified by routine cultures. The mode of delivery should therefore be based on the presence or absence of lesions at the time of confinement. Cesarean section should be reserved for patients with lesions or with prodromal symptoms of recurrent disease at the time of delivery. Patients with ruptured membranes and active genital lesions should also be delivered by cesarean section. The spectrum of HPV-related diseases in pregnancy is poorly understood. Many questions remain unanswered. It may not be practical to treat very large or extensive genital warts during pregnancy. A cesarean section may be the best choice in these cases. It may be premature to recommend cesarean section for delivery of all pregnant women with symptomatic genital HPV infection. More data are needed. We recommend laser ablation of condylomatous lesions when discovered during pregnancy. Laser vaporization is associated with minimal morbidity when used by experienced surgeons. Trichloroacetic acid is excellent for minimal disease or for treatment of recurrences in pregnancy. Since the immune system seems to play an important role in control of viral disease, we advise pregnant patients to adopt a lifestyle which promotes health. We advise a balanced diet, an appropriate exercise program, and an environment free of unnecessary stress. We suggest avoidance of cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol.",Virus_Diseases
"Glycosaminoglycans production by cultured skin fibroblasts from the Pasini and Cockayne-Touraine forms of dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of glycosaminoglycans e (GAG) production were made on fibroblast lines cultured from the skin of six patients with the Pasini (albopapuloid) form of dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, six with the non-albopapuloid form (Cockayne-Touraine), eight lines from patients with simplex or recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and eight lines from normal individuals. A reasonable match of donor age and gender, site, and passage number was achieved. Contrary to an earlier report, the lines from the Pasini group were unexceptional in the amount of GAG they secreted and the proportions of sulfated and nonsulfated GAG showed no consistent difference from the Cockayne-Touraine or control lines. The Pasini lines secreted 77 +/- 18 (SEM) microgram GAG-uronic acid per 10(7) cells and the Cockayne-Touraine lines 81 +/- 12 micrograms at equivalent cells densities. Sulfated GAG represented averages of 19 +/- 4+ in Pasini lines, 17 +/- 5% in Cockayne-Touraine, and 14 +/- 3% in controls. These findings are consistent with current views of albopapuloid lesions as an unreliable clinical sign in epidermolysis bullosa and bring into question the validity of the Pasini entity.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The comparative efficacy and toxicity of second-line drugs in rheumatoid arthritis. Results of two metaanalyses. We performed 2 metaanalyses of placebo-controlled and comparative clinical trials to examine the relative efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate (MTX), injectable gold, D-penicillamine (DP), sulfasalazine (SSZ), auranofin (AUR), and antimalarial drugs, the second-line drugs most commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). For the efficacy study, we applied a set of inclusion criteria and focused on trials which provided information on tender joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or grip strength. We found 66 clinical trials that contained 117 treatment groups of interest, and for each drug, we combined the treatment groups. For each outcome, results showed that AUR tended to be weaker than other second-line drugs. The results of the 3 outcome measures were synthesized into a composite measure of outcomes, and AUR was significantly weaker than MTX (P = 0.006), injectable gold (P less than 0.0001), DP (P less than 0.0001), and SSZ (P = 0.009) and was slightly, but not significantly, weaker than antimalarial agents (P = 0.11). We also found heterogeneity among antimalarial agents, in that patients treated with chloroquine did better than those treated with hydroxychloroquine. We found little difference in efficacy between MTX, injectable gold, DP, and SSZ. A power analysis showed that a trial should contain at least 170 patients per treatment group to successfully differentiate between more effective and less effective (e.g., AUR) second-line drugs. None of the reported interdrug comparative trials we reviewed were this large. For the toxicity study, our inclusion criteria captured RA trials which reported the proportion of patients who discontinued therapy because of drug toxicity and the total proportion who dropped out. We found 71 clinical trials that contained 129 treatment groups. The average proportion who dropped out and the average proportion who dropped out because of drug toxicity were computed for each drug. Overall, 30.2% of the patients in these trials dropped out; 50% of them did so because of drug toxicity. Injectable gold had higher toxicity rates (P less than 0.05) and higher total dropout rates (P less than 0.01) than any other drug; 30% of gold-treated patients dropped out because of side effects versus 15% of all trial patients. Antimalarial drugs and AUR had relatively low rates of toxicity; the rate for MTX was imprecise because of discrepancies between trials. Thus, of the commonly used second-line drugs, AUR is the weakest, and injectable gold is the most toxic. Agents introduced in the future will be compared with these drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Intrauterine diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and rubella infections by amniocentesis. OBJECTIVE: To establish a correlation between the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) or rubella virus in amniotic fluid obtained through amniocentesis and fetal infection. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Five hospitals in the Montreal region. Virology testing was done at the Virology Research Centre, Institut Armand-Frappier, Laval, Que. PATIENTS: Thirteen pregnant women infected with CMV, 3 with rubella, their 15 babies and 2 fetuses. Twelve of the women with CMV infection were recruited from a prospective study of CMV infection in pregnancy. Infection in the other women was detected through routine laboratory diagnostic testing. INTERVENTION: Amniotic fluid samples were cultured for CMV and rubella virus. Congenital infection of the neonates was established through isolation of either virus from pharyngeal mucus and urine specimens collected during the first 3 days of life or from fetal tissue if the pregnancy was terminated. MAIN RESULTS: CMV was cultured from the amniotic fluid of three of the CMV-infected women and from the pharyngeal mucus and urine specimens of their infants. Of the three women with rubella the amniotic fluid of one (who had a twin pregnancy) was positive for rubella virus. After the in-utero death of one fetus she underwent a therapeutic abortion of both. Examination of fetal tissue indicated that both fetuses had been infected with rubella virus. Each of the two other women with rubella gave birth to an uninfected, healthy infant. CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong correlation between the isolation of CMV or rubella virus from the amniotic fluid and the presence of congenital infection. This suggests that amniocentesis used to detect the presence of a virus is a useful method for the diagnosis of fetal infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Diclofenac-associated hepatotoxicity  Diclofenac sodium, a phenylacetic acid-derived nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) recently released in the United States, was associated with the development of significant hepatitis in seven patients, with one associated death. Signs and symptoms developed within several weeks of initiation of drug use and generally resolved 4 to 6 weeks following discontinuation of use of the drug. The only patient rechallenged with the drug developed a recurrence of her hepatic abnormalities. In one patient, fatal, fulminant hepatitis developed despite early withdrawal of the drug. Review of the European literature disclosed three additional fatalities associated with diclofenac therapy. It is unclear whether the incidence of hepatotoxicity is higher with this drug compared with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

"Multiple keratoacanthomas treated with oral retinoids. Multiple eruptive keratoacanthoma of Witten and Zak is a rare disorder characterized by numerous small, eruptive tumors and larger, more typical keratoacanthomas. Affected patients have features of Grzybowski-type keratoacanthomas and Ferguson Smith type. Two patients with multiple keratoacanthomas were treated with oral retinoids. Both patients had hundreds of follicular papules on the trunk and extremities. Less common lesions included nodules with central horn-filled craters more characteristic of classic keratoacanthomas. Retinoid therapy resulted in regression of the larger, more typical keratoacanthomas in both patients. The small follicular keratoacanthomas remained unaffected. Thus oral retinoids are only partially beneficial for the treatment of the Grzybowski type or the Witten and Zak type of multiple eruptive keratoacanthomas.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection of homosexual men is accompanied by a decrease in circulating B cells. As part of the multidisciplinary effort to characterize the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the cell-surface phenotypes of lymphocytes from a cohort of homosexual men were analyzed in detail and related to clinical and laboratory parameters associated with HIV-1 infection. The present study represents a cross-sectional analysis of coded specimens from 153 homosexual men, of whom 74 were seronegative and 79 seropositive for HIV-1. Fewer circulating B lymphocytes (CD19+) were found in HIV-1-seropositive subjects relative to a seronegative reference group. HIV seropositivity was not associated with decreased numbers of CD8+ T cells or activated T cells, which suggests that the number of circulating B cells specifically decreased. In addition to CD19, B cells were measured by CD20 and CD21 in a subset of subjects, and decreases in circulating CD20+ and CD21+ B cells were also apparent in HIV-1-seropositive subjects. The decrease in B-cell numbers was present at the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection (asymptomatic, clinically silent) and became more pronounced at more advanced stages of HIV-1 infection. The absolute B-cell numbers correlated with absolute CD4+ cell numbers (r = 0.59, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that HIV-1 infection is associated with progressive, selective decreases in the numbers of circulating CD4+ T cells and B cells.",Virus_Diseases
"Pediatric mastocytosis. The onset of mastocytosis occurs between birth and 2 years of age in approximately 55% of all cases; an additional 10% develop the disease before the age of 15 years. Mastocytosis in these age groups differs in many respects from mastocytosis that has its onset in adulthood. The typical presentation of pediatric-onset mastocytosis consists of cutaneous manifestations: either a solitary mastocytoma, urticaria pigmentosa, or, less commonly, diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. Particularly in infants, bullous eruptions may occur. Mastocytosis in infants and children may involve internal organs, including the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract, although such manifestations appear to be less common in children than in adults. Plasma histamine levels may be elevated in pediatric-onset mastocytosis. Treatment usually involves the use of H1 and H2 antihistamines to control itching and to control the hypersecretion of gastric acid that may occur. The prognosis for children with mast cell disease is variable; approximately half of the children with urticaria pigmentosa may experience resolution of lesions and symptoms by adolescence.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Characterization of a macrophage-tropic HIV strain that does not alter macrophage cytokine production yet protects macrophages from superinfection by vesicular stomatitis virus. Macrophages, unlike CD4+ T cells, can be productively infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) without prior cellular activation. Cytopathic infection ensues without the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), or tissue factor genes. In detailed studies on TNF alpha, HIV infection did not affect the regulation of TNF alpha in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. In an effort to examine the interferon responsiveness of HIV-infected macrophages, the cells were challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with or without interferon pretreatment. Surprisingly, HIV-infected macrophages were completely resistant to VSV-induced lysis even in the absence of interferon; however, no interferon was detected in the supernatants of these infected cells. The resistance of HIV-infected macrophages to superinfection with VSV indicates a previously undescribed effect of HIV upon macrophage cellular metabolism.",Virus_Diseases

"Interferon-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in serum of patients in various stages of HIV-1 infection. Serum samples of 120 patients in different stages of chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, 11 patients with primary HIV-1 infection (PHI), and 49 HIV-1 seronegative homosexual men were analyzed for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Increased levels of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha were found in some, but not all, cases with PHI. During progressing disease IFN-alpha occurred in serum with increasing frequency and concentration. Raised levels of TNF-alpha were found in all stages of chronic infection, but were less common in patients with AIDS than were raised levels of IFN-alpha. The levels of the two substances were not correlated. There was a correlation between IFN-alpha, but not TNF-alpha, and the occurrence of HIV-1 p24 antigen in serum. These results suggest that IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha are induced by different agents during HIV-1 infection. The findings would be consistent with the hypothesis that IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha are counteracting forces that have important down- and upregulatory effects, respectively, on HIV-1 replication in vivo.",Virus_Diseases
"Synovial fluid polymorphonuclear leucocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis have reduced MPO and NADPH-oxidase activity. Synovial fluid (SF) polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were compared to RA and normal circulating blood PMN. RA SF PMN were as viable as blood PMN and remained viable for up to 24 h in culture. Measurement of myeloperoxidase indicated that RA SF PMN had degranulated and secreted their myeloperoxidase prior to isolation, 26.5 +/- 11.7% being found extracellularly compared to less than 2.9% in RA and normal blood PMN. RA SF PMN alone showed a decrease in basal NADPH-oxidase activity as well as an increase in responsiveness to stimulation by chemotactic peptide during culture. Stimulation of PMN with phorbol-12-myrisitate-13-acetate evoked equivalent responses in each population before and after culture.

"Syncytial giant-cell hepatitis. Sporadic hepatitis with distinctive pathological features, a severe clinical course, and paramyxoviral features. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. We describe a new form of hepatitis, occurring in 10 patients over a period of six years, characterized clinically by manifestations of severe hepatitis, histologically by large syncytial giant hepatocytes, and ultrastructurally by intracytoplasmic structures consistent with paramyxoviral nucleocapsids. RESULTS. The patients ranged in age from 5 months to 41 years. The tentative clinical diagnosis before biopsy was non-A, non-B hepatitis in five patients and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in the others. Five patients underwent liver transplantation; the others died. The diagnosis of syncytial giant-cell hepatitis was established pathologically. The liver cords were replaced in all 10 patients by syncytial giant cells with up to 30 nuclei. In 8 of the 10 the cytoplasm contained pleomorphic particles of 150 to 250 microns, filamentous strands, and particles of 14 to 17 nm with peripherally disposed spikes resembling paramyxoviral nucleocapsids. Structures resembling degenerated forms were found in the other two patients. One of two chimpanzees injected with a liver homogenate from the index patient had an increase in the titer of paramyxoviral antibodies, probably an anamnestic reaction to previous paramyxoviral infection, suggesting that a paramyxoviral antigen but not viable virus was present in the liver homogenate.

Although further virologic studies will be required for precise classification, we believe that paramyxoviruses should be considered in patients with severe sporadic hepatitis.",Virus_Diseases
"Otolaryngology problems in the immune compromised patient--an evolving natural history. As the human immunodeficiency virus is being detected in increasing numbers of asymptomatic individuals at risk, newer earlier patterns of disease have become apparent--including cranial and cervical herpes zoster, oral hairy leukoplakia, and oral candidiasis--thus linking viral and other disease to the development of acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS). Many similarities between patients with AIDS and other immunosuppressed patients have emerged. As immunosuppressed patients survive longer, they begin to manifest cancers such as lymphomas and squamous cell cancers in addition to Kaposi's sarcoma. Otolaryngologists can learn to identify and treat otitis and sinusitis in the immunosuppressed patient, to identify predictive early signs such as oral hairy leukoplakia, herpes simplex virus, and oral candidiasis, and to diagnose and treat Kaposi's sarcomas of the head and neck, lymphomas, squamous cell cancers, and opportunistic infections as the immunodeficiency disease progresses.",Virus_Diseases

Eleven (10.2%) of 108 infants in the rhesus vaccine group, 11 (10.4%) of 106 in the RIT 4237 group, and 9 (8.4%) of 107 in the placebo group experienced rotavirus diarrhea during the follow-up period of 17 months. Thus, in this population, neither vaccine was efficacious in preventing rotavirus diarrhea.",Virus_Diseases
"The calcium-sensitive epitope of pemphigus foliaceus antigen is present on a murine tryptic fragment and constitutes a major antigenic region for human autoantibodies. Recent findings indicate that the pemphigus foliaceus (PF) antigen is involved in epidermal cell adhesion and that characteristic PF lesions result from loss of this function as a consequence of autoantibody binding. In the present communication we present data on the epitopes involved in the human autoantibody binding to an immunologically reactive murine tryptic fragment of the PF antigen (tf-PF). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that 39 PF sera, obtained from North American, Colombian, and Brazilian patients recognized only calcium-sensitive epitope(s) on the tf-PF. Immunofluorescence blocking experiments showed that preincubation with tf-PF completely blocked the immunofluorescence of 80% of the sera when tested on human skin substrate, and 86% of the sera when tested on murine skin substrate. These results show that the calcium-sensitive epitope(s) originally recognized on human PF complex, is (are) present on the murine tf-PF and constitute(s) a major antigenic region for the human PF autoantibodies. They also implicate this region of the PF antigen in the pathogenesis of PF as well as in epidermal cell adhesion.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Predictors of morbidity and mortality in neonates with herpes simplex virus infections. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group. BACKGROUND. In a controlled trial comparing acyclovir with vidarabine in the treatment of neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, we found no significant difference between the treatments in adjusted mortality and morbidity. Hence, we sought to define for the entire cohort (n = 202) the clinical characteristics that best predicted the eventual outcome in these neonates. METHODS. Data were gathered prospectively at 27 centers between 1981 and 1988 in infants less than one month of age who had virologically confirmed HSV infection. We examined the outcomes by multivariate analyses of 24 variables. Disease was classified in one of three categories based on the extent of the involvement at entry into the trial: infection confined to skin, eyes, or mouth; encephalitis; or disseminated infection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. There were no deaths among the 85 infants with localized HSV infection. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the 46 neonates with disseminated infection (57 percent) than in the 71 with encephalitis (15 percent). In addition, the risk of death was increased in neonates who were in or near coma at entry (relative risk, 5.2), had disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (relative risk, 3.8), or were premature (relative risk, 3.7). In babies with disseminated disease, HSV pneumonitis was also associated with greater mortality (relative risk, 3.6). In the survivors, morbidity was most frequent in infants with encephalitis (relative risk, 4.4), disseminated infection (relative risk, 2.1), seizures (relative risk, 3.0), or infection with HSV type 2 (relative risk, 4.9). With HSV infection limited to the skin, eyes, or mouth, the presence of three or more recurrences of vesicles was associated with an increased risk of neurologic impairment as compared with two or fewer recurrences.",Virus_Diseases
"Asthma and eczema in children born to women with migraine. Migraine and asthma have been reported to occur in the same person more commonly than would be expected if they are independent. The large Collaborative Perinatal Project provided an opportunity to see if children born to women with migraine or with the group of disorders characterized by asthma and/or allergies were more likely to manifest asthma or eczema in the first 7 years of life. Among children whose mothers had neither migraine nor asthma/allergies, 3.2% had asthma. Of children whose mothers had migraine, but not asthma/allergies, more than 6% had asthma. The risk of asthma among children born to women who had both migraine and asthma/allergies was greater than the risk associated with each maternal disease. The risk of eczema in children was not appreciably influenced by the mother's propensity to migraine or asthma/allergies. The results of this first study of migraine in one generation and asthma in the next lead to the conclusion that the two disorders are probably related.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Systemic treatment with interferon-alpha 2B: an effective method to prevent sterility after bilateral mumps orchitis. In men orchitis represents the most common complication of mumps infection and occurs in 5 to 37% of this population. Bilateral manifestation is observed in 16 to 65% of the patients. The most important danger is the risk of testicular atrophy which results in sterility. Four patients with bilateral mumps orchitis received systemic treatment with interferon-alpha 2B (3 x 10(6) IU per day) for 7 days. All acute symptoms of mumps orchitis disappeared within 2 to 4 days of hospitalization. During 6 to 15 months of followup no incidence of testicular atrophy was observed. In 3 of 4 patients pre-treatment examination revealed subfertility (oligoasthenospermia), while 2 to 4 months after interferon treatment, as well as during the entire followup period normospermia was found. No severe adverse effects occurred during treatment. The flu-like symptoms could be prevented by concomitant administration of paracetamol (500 mg. 3 times a day). Systemic treatment with interferon-alpha 2B appears to be highly effective in preventing sterility and testicular atrophy after bilateral mumps orchitis. Further investigations involving larger populations should be performed to establish the present promising results.",Virus_Diseases
"Effect of long-term PUVA treatment of psoriasis on the collagen and elastin gene expression and growth of skin fibroblasts in vitro. The proliferation rate, collagen metabolism and collagen and elastin messenger-RNA levels were studied in fibroblasts derived from patients who had received many courses of either systemic 8-methoxypsoralen or topical trioxsalen PUVA treatment. The proliferation rate of fibroblasts as measured by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine or by cellular division was decreased in those obtained from patients who had PUVA treatment as compared with controls. Collagen synthesis was slightly increased in the cells from PUVA-treated patients, but the relative collagen synthesis and the ratio between types I and III collagen were unchanged. The levels of collagen and elastin mRNAs were increased in fibroblasts derived from the PUVA-treated patients. No significant differences in histology or immunochemistry could be found in the biopsies taken from topical and systemic PUVA-treated patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"The relationship of pemphigus to neoplasia. A statistically increased incidence of malignancy has been observed in patients with pemphigus. A review of the literature reveals 42 cases of nonthymic malignancies and 18 cases of thymic malignancies. A significant predominance of men, with mean age at onset of 50 years, was observed. Pemphigus vulgaris is more common in patients with nonthymic neoplasms, whereas pemphigus foliaceus or pemphigus erythematosus and pemphigus vulgaris are equally common in patients with thymic neoplasms. Lymphoreticular malignancies, especially Kaposi's sarcoma, are most frequently observed. The majority of patients with nonthymic neoplasms have pemphigus before the detection of the malignancy and have a favorable 5-year survival rate after tumor resection. The majority of the patients with thymic neoplasms have a thymoma before the development of pemphigus. In some patients pemphigus develops after thymectomy and myasthenia gravis is often associated. Overall, 37 of the 60 patients, or 61%, had a neoplasm of the immune system.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Refractory hypoglycemia secondary to topical salicylate intoxication. We describe a case of severe refractory hypoglycemia secondary to topical salicylate intoxication. A 72-year-old man with psoriasis and end-stage renal disease was treated with a topical cream containing 10% salicylic acid. The patient presented with encephalopathy and subsequently developed hypoglycemia refractory to infusions of large amounts of glucose. A serum salicylate concentration was elevated at 3.2 mmol/L. Emergent hemodialysis was accompanied by rapid lowering of serum salicylate concentration and resolution of refractory hypoglycemia. Salicylate is well absorbed across normal and diseased skin. Salicylate markedly impairs gluconeogenesis and increases glucose utilization, resulting in hypoglycemia. To our knowledge, this is the first article on hypoglycemia due to the application of topical salicylate.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C. We evaluated oral ribavirin as therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection in a pilot study including 10 patients. Patients (7 men, 3 women; mean age 40 years, range 23-54) all had biopsy-proven chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis and were repeatedly positive for antibodies to hepatitis C virus. Treatment was with oral ribavirin 1000-1200 mg per day in two divided doses for 12 weeks. The median serum alanine aminotransferase concentration for all patients at enrollment was 3.15 mu kat/l (range 1.22-7.79) and decreased significantly (p less than 0.005) to 1.25 mu kat/l (0.78-2.04) after 12 weeks of treatment. Within 6 weeks of the end of treatment the median serum alanine aminotransferase concentration was not significantly different from that before treatment. Side-effects were mild and fully reversible after cessation of therapy. We conclude that ribavirin is the first drug to offer a potentially effective oral treatment for chronic hepatitis C. It should be further evaluated in controlled trials, possibly in combination with interferon alpha.",Virus_Diseases
"Monitoring of specific antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus structural proteins: clinical significance. Levels of antibodies to six major structural proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (gp120, gp41, p66, p31, p24, and p17) were assessed in serial samples from 22 persons with severe hemophilia (16 asymptomatic and 6 who developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] or AIDS-related complex) with an automated dot blot assay using purified recombinant antigens. High and sustained levels of antibody to gp120, gp41, and p31 were found in all patients irrespective of their clinical condition for 4 to 6 years after seroconversion. In contrast, immune response to p66 and p17 was significantly lower in symptomatic patients. Over time, the levels of these two antibodies, as well as anti-p24, decreased and tended to become undetectable. Abnormal immune response and low levels of antibody to p66 and p17 are early indications of rapid clinical progression.",Virus_Diseases

In a previous study, however, cadmium appeared to enhance mouse resistance to influenza pneumonia. We report herein on the influence of cadmium intoxication in mice on different factors of anti-influenza immunity, e.g., antibody response, local production of interferon, pulmonary cellular response, and the interaction between pulmonary alveolar macrophages and the influenza virus. Cadmium inhalation did not affect production of antibodies or interferon. The protective effect appeared to be related to an enhanced supply to phagocytic cells into the lung.",Virus_Diseases
"Hepatitis prevalence in trauma patients. The risks of viral transmission from trauma patients is a continuing concern to those involved in their care. However, the prevalence of hepatitis (HPT) in trauma patients is poorly described. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of HPT in trauma patients admitted to an urban trauma center. Two hundred sixty-four consecutive admissions to an urban Level I trauma center underwent serologic screening for HPT. Risk factors were assessed by direct patient questioning. Serologic evidence of HPT B was found in 19.7 per cent of patients. Intravenous (IV) drug abusers represented eight per cent of the study population; this group had a 67 per cent rate of seropositivity. Hepatitis A was not found in any patient. Antigenemia was found in 1.9 per cent of patients. It is concluded that HPT B seropositivity is common in trauma patients. IV drug abusers have particularly high prevalence of HPT. This high prevalence rate of HPT B serology poses a significant risk to those involved with the care of trauma patients. The authors suggest that specific protocols to avoid the transmission of viral disease should be mandatory in urban trauma centers.",Virus_Diseases
"Treatment failure of genital condylomata acuminata in women: role of the male sexual partner. The male sexual partners of women with genital condylomata acuminata are thought to be carriers of human papillomaviruses. It is therefore often recommended that both sexual partners be treated. We studied 360 women with genital warts to test the hypothesis that when the male partners of women with condylomata acuminata are treated, the treatment failure rate decreases. The male sexual partners of 180 of these women were examined and, if indicated, treated (treatment group). The 180 remaining male sexual partners were neither examined nor treated (control group). One hundred twenty-two (68%) men in the treatment group had human papillomavirus-associated lesions. The treatment failure rate of women was 16.7% in the treatment group and 18.9% in the control group. The difference is not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the treatment failure rate of women with condylomata acuminata decreases if their male sexual partners are also treated.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Clinical manifestations in anticardiolipin antibody-positive patients with progressive systemic sclerosis. Anticardiolipin antibody-positive patients with progressive systemic sclerosis were analyzed. Elevated anticardiolipin antibody titers were observed in 13 of 40 cases (33%). Anticardiolipin antibody titer was significantly higher in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis type 1 than in those with type 2 or type 3. Occurrence of anticardiolipin antibody was significantly more frequent in patients positive for anti-nRNP antibodies, rheumatoid factor, or thrombocytopenia. In contrast, patients with proximal scleroderma, scarring, or esophageal hypomotility were positive for anticardiolipin antibody less frequently. These results suggest that anticardiolipin antibody might be closely associated with lupuslike clinical manifestations in a subset of progressive systemic sclerosis or definite progressive systemic sclerosis with thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid factor, or anti-nRNP antibodies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Administration of folinic acid after low dose methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Folinic acid (leucovorin) supplementation has been suggested as a possible means of treating the short term side effects that occur with low dose methotrexate (MTX). However, it has not been established whether leucovorin will abrogate the antiarthritic effect of MTX. We entered 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with MTX into a 48 week randomized, double blind, crossover trial of folinic acid vs placebo. The dose of folinic acid was equal to the dose of MTX and it was given orally 4 h following the single, weekly MTX administration. Under these conditions, leucovorin did not decrease the therapeutic effect of MTX. While the incidence of stomatitis and gastrointestinal toxicity were lower during leucovorin treatment, our study lacked sufficient power to establish a statistically significant difference.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Recognition of human 60 kD heat shock protein by mononuclear cells from patients with juvenile chronic arthritis. A postulated mechanism for autoimmune disorders is that the immunoreactivity develops against bacterial antigens which show a high degree of sequence homology with mammalian proteins. The mycobacterial 65 kD heat shock protein (hsp) has been implicated in several forms of arthritis. Substantial amounts of the human 60 kD homologue (hsp60) were produced by insertion of the gene into Escherichia coli. To investigate the hypothesis that T-cell reactivity is directed against the endogenous hsp, T-cell proliferation of synovial-fluid and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in response to hsp60 was studied in samples from six patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) and nine adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There was no T-lymphocyte proliferative response to purified fractions of hsp60 in mononuclear cells from RA patients or healthy children and young adults. However, both synovial-fluid and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from JCA patients showed substantial proliferative responses. There was a significant correlation between the stimulation indices for human hsp60 and for mycobacterial hsp65 (r = 0.948, p less than 0.02). A similar correlation for hsp60 and mycobacterial hsp70 did not achieve significance. Immunohistochemistry showed that hsp65 and hsp70 homologues were expressed in the synovial membrane in these patients but not in controls. These findings suggest a sequence of events in which hsps become expressed during synovial inflammation and function as autoantigens. In JCA this may be manifested by specific T-cell reactivity which apparently is lost in the more bone-eroding and non-remitting adult disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The donation and sale of blood by intravenous drug users. In spite of efforts to dissuade intravenous drug users (IVDUs) from donating or selling blood, some continue to do so. As part of a longitudinal study, 915 IVDUs in South Florida were interviewed concerning their history of donation or sale of blood and tested for antibodies to HIV-1 and HTLV-I/II. Approximately 17 percent had either donated or sold blood during 1985 through 1988; most contributors (80.4 percent) sold to commercial blood services. IVDUs who had donated/sold blood were more likely to be male and not in drug treatment than were those who had not contributed blood. IVDUs not in treatment at the time of interview were more likely than IVDUs in treatment to have sold blood. Of those who had donated/sold blood since 1985, 19.6 percent subsequently tested positive for antibodies to HIV-1 and 5.7 percent were positive for antibodies to HTLV-I/II.

"Induction of feline immunodeficiency syndrome by feline leukemia virus: pituitary and adrenocortical dysfunctions. Seven young cats were injected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV); six of them became viremic. All of the viremic cats developed AIDS-related symptoms, i.e. lymphopenia, neutropenia, thymic atrophy, and wasting syndrome, along with an altered pituitary and adrenocortical function. These symptoms closely resemble human AIDS induced by HIV. It was discovered that, after 2 weeks of infection, the average amount of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) detected in the infected cats was reduced by 29% in comparison with that before the infection. In contrast to the second week, the fifth week of infection showed a 94% increase of plasma ACTH which then dropped back down to 38% after the sixth and seventh weeks. This opposing biphasic pattern of change was also observed in the plasma cortisol content of the infected cats. The amount of change in plasma cortisol did not correlate with the detected increase in plasma ACTH, indicating a weak adrenal response to pituitary action.",Virus_Diseases
"Autoantibodies from patients with localized and generalized bullous pemphigoid immunoprecipitate the same 230-kd keratinocyte antigen. Two patients demonstrating the typical clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic features of nonscarring localized bullous pemphigoid are described. These patients possess circulating IgG autoantibodies that bind the epidermal side of 1.0-mol/L sodium chloride-split human skin in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunnoprecipitation studies demonstrate that these patients have circulating autoantibodies that immunoprecipitate the same 230-kd bullous pemphigoid antigen that is precipitated by autoantibodies from patients with generalized bullous pemphigoid. These findings indicate that localized bullous pemphigoid is a true clinical variant of generalized pemphigoid rather than a separate nosologic entity.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Itraconazole in the treatment of tinea capitis. Fifty patients with tinea capitis were treated with itraconazole, 25 to 100 mg/day, for 20 to 73 days in six countries. Forty-seven patients (94%) responded clinically (healed or markedly improved) to therapy, of which 38 patients (76%) completely healed and 9 patients (18%) markedly improved. Three patients (6%) failed therapy. Forty-two patients were assessable for mycologic examination; 38 patients (93%) converted mycologically to negative and 4 patients (7%) remained positive for organisms. In one group of 20 patients treated for 30 days, 6 patients were clinically and mycologically healed. By the 2-week follow-up visit 9 additional patients were healed, and 4 weeks after treatment all 20 patients were both clinically and mycologically healed. The primary organisms reported were Microsporum canis and Trichophyton tonsurans. Only one patient reported a possible side effect (tired legs).

In this paper the cognitive and psychiatric impairments associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and related disorders are reviewed. It is concluded that while acute mononucleosis and infection with Epstein-Barr virus occasionally result in impaired cognition, such changes have not yet been objectively verified in patients with CFS. However, when patients with CFS are carefully studied, concurrent or premorbid psychiatric disorders are revealed at a greater than chance level. Finally, some suggestions are offered regarding improved neuropsychological assessment of fatigue, concentration, and attention for patients with CFS. The findings to date, while suggesting that psychological predisposition may play a role in the expression of CFS, are still inconclusive regarding the etiology of CFS.",Virus_Diseases
"Symptomatic polyneuropathy in human immunodeficiency virus antibody seropositive men with and without immune deficiency: a comparative electrophysiological study. Symptomatic polyneuropathy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was studied in ten men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in ten men without the immune deficiency. In both groups of patients electrophysiological signs of polyneuropathy of the axonal type were present in the sural, median and peroneal nerves. The AIDS patients had a greater reduction of the mean (SD) sural nerve action potential, 3.1 (2.7) microV, than in patients without AIDS, 10.2 (6.1) microV (p less than 0.01) and greater slowing of peroneal nerve conduction velocity, 42.6 (1.4) m/s in AIDS patients versus 52.6 (3.3) m/s in patients without AIDS (p less than 0.0001). These findings indicate that in most HIV infected patients the severity but not the type of neuropathy depends on whether an immune deficient state has developed. Seven patients with symptomatic polyneuropathy were treated with azidothymidine (AZT) for an average of 10 months and compared with a group of five untreated patients with similar symptoms. No effect of AZT treatment on sural or median nerve amplitude or conduction velocity or on the vibratory or temperature thresholds was observed.",Virus_Diseases

"Pharmacokinetics of didanosine in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex. The pharmacokinetics of didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine) after intravenous and oral administration were evaluated in an open, escalating-dose phase I study in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or severe AIDS-related complex. Didanosine was administered twice a day for 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion of 60 minutes duration at doses ranging from 0.4 to 16.5 mg/kg, followed by 4 weeks of oral treatment at twice the intravenous dose. Serial blood and urine samples were obtained on the first and final day of intravenous administration and after the first oral dose, as well as at steady state. Didanosine demonstrated linear pharmacokinetic behavior over the dose ranges of 0.4 to 16.5 mg/kg intravenously and 0.8 to 10.2 mg/kg orally. There was no indication of significant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters with repeated administration. The apparent elimination half-life after oral administration was approximately 1.4 hour. Renal clearance values exceeded the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that active tubular secretion of didanosine occurs. Bioavailability of didanosine when administered as a solution with an antacid was approximately 43% for doses from 0.8 to 10.2 mg/kg in patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS-related complex.

"A substitution at a non-glycine position in the triple-helical domain of pro alpha 2(I) collagen chains present in an individual with a variant of the Marfan syndrome. A substitution for a highly conserved non-glycine residue in the triple-helical domain of the pro alpha 2(I) collagen molecule was found in an individual with a variant of the Marfan syndrome. A single base change resulted in substitution of arginine618 by glutamine at the Y position of a Gly-X-Y repeat, and is responsible for the decreased migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gels of some pro alpha 2(I) chains of type I collagen synthesized by dermal fibroblasts from this individual. Family studies suggest that this substitution was inherited from the individual's father who also produces abnormally migrating pro alpha 2(I) collagen chains and shares some of the abnormal skeletal features. This single base change creates a new Bsu36 I (Sau I, Mst II) restriction site detectable in genomic DNA by Southern blot analysis when probed with a COL1A2 fragment. The analysis of 52 control individuals (103 chromosomes) was negative for the new Bsu36 I site, suggesting that the substitution is not a common polymorphism.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Female-to-male transmission of human immunodeficiency virus  OBJECTIVE.--To examine rates of heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and associated risk factors and to determine the relative efficiency of female-to-male and male-to-female transmission. DESIGN.--Survey of infected individuals and their heterosexual partners recruited since 1985. SETTING.--Participants were recruited from various HIV counseling and testing sites throughout California but were generally interviewed and tested in their homes. PARTICIPANTS.--Data from 379 couples at entry to the study are reported: 72 male partners of infected women and 307 female partners of infected men. The infected index case had a well-established source of risk; couples were eliminated if the direction of transmission could not be established. The majority of couples were monogamous since 1978, white, and in their 30s. Most partners did not know their serostatus at entry into the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE.--HIV serostatus in the exposed sexual partner. RESULTS.--We observed one probable instance (1%) of female-to-male transmission compared with 20% transmission rates in the female partners of infected men. All couples were sampled in the same way. Male index cases were more likely to be symptomatic than female index cases. CONCLUSION.--The odds of male-to-female transmission were significantly greater than female-to-male transmission. The one case of female-to-male transmission was unique in that the couple reported numerous unprotected sexual contacts and noted several instances of vaginal and penile bleeding during intercourse.",Virus_Diseases

"Postmortem studies of the heart in three fatal cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hearts of individuals who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan, with particular attention paid to the coronary arteries, the neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart because of reported terminal disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Segregation analysis of the structural genes of the major fibrillar collagens provides further evidence of molecular heterogeneity in type II Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Type II Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is one of a group of disorders characterized by striking abnormalities of the soft connective tissues. The major fibrillar collagens (types I and III) found in these tissues have important stress-bearing functions and abnormal collagen could therefore account for the clinical features of this condition. We have used a number of restriction site dimorphisms, tightly linked to the structural genes of type I collagen (COL1A1 COL1A2) and type III collagen (COL3A1), to investigate the segregation of corresponding alleles in three pedigrees in which type II EDS was clearly inherited as a dominant trait. Discordant segregation of all three collagen genes was seen in a large pedigree that included 17 affected individuals with the typical phenotype of type II EDS. Thus mutations in neither type I nor type III collagen genes were responsible for the disease in this family. In a second small pedigree discordant segregation of the disease with both type I collagen loci was observed while the concordant segregation seen at COL3A1 could easily have arisen by chance (P = 0.5). The third pedigree was uninformative at all three collagen loci because of inability to discriminate between the parental alleles.

We describe a procedure to expand contractures of the tunica albuginea by multiple full thickness relaxing incisions followed by inlay of tailored temporalis fascia free grafts. This technique is performed without resection of the tunica albuginea, although in the case of calcified plaques the calcifications themselves are removed, preserving the overlying tunica. Between September 1988 and February 1990, 12 patients have undergone this procedure, all of whom have greater than 3 months of followup and have experienced spontaneous erections within the first week postoperatively. Of the patients 11 resumed intercourse within 8 weeks of surgery and 1 required 12 weeks. No patient had sensory loss postoperatively and there has been no donor site morbidity. Correction of curvature was accomplished in all patients and there have been no recurrences within a maximal followup of 22 months. Within the limitations of such a small study we believe that there is evidence supporting this approach in potent patients with severe acquired penile curvature.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Second-generation H1-receptor antagonists. The second-generation H1-receptor antagonists do not penetrate into the central nervous system as readily as the first-generation H1-receptor antagonists do. They bind preferentially to peripheral rather than central H1-receptors. They cause no more sedation than placebo does. These medications differ considerably from one another in some aspects of basic pharmacology and in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. An understanding of these differences will facilitate their optimal clinical usage. The second-generation H1-receptor antagonists are replacing the first generation H1-receptor antagonists in the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and in relieving pruritus in patients with urticaria. They have a mild beneficial effect in patients with chronic asthma. They have not supplanted the first generation H1-receptor antagonists in atopic dermatitis treatment or as adjunctive treatment of pruritus and other symptoms in patients with anaphylaxis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Results of a one year longitudinal study of HIV antibody test notification from the San Francisco General Hospital cohort. We examined the psychological impact of HIV antibody testing in 107 homosexual men in San Francisco. Seventy-eight percent of the seropositives but only 43% of the seronegatives correctly anticipated their results. Twelve months after notification (but not earlier), notified seropositives reported significantly greater increases in total distress than nonnotified controls. However, notified seronegatives demonstrated significantly lower levels of hopelessness than nonnotified controls at every follow-up assessment. Thus, knowledge of HIV antibody status appears to dispel a sense of gloom in persons who incorrectly believe themselves to be infected with HIV, but does not appear to induce significant distress in those whose expectation of a positive result is confirmed. Both groups reported lower distress than men with ARC or AIDS, suggesting that distress was related more to symptomatology than knowing antibody status. These results suggest the benefits of HIV testing for the considerable proportion of seronegative subjects believing themselves to be seropositive and should be weighted against the more limited induction of distress in seropositives who receive confirmation of their test result expectation. The benefits of testing are also supported by increasing knowledge of the usefulness of early intervention in HIV disease.",Virus_Diseases
"The relationship between plasma psoralen concentration and psoralen-UVA erythema. The plasma 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) concentration was measured in 60 patients commencing psoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA). At the time of blood sampling each patient was phototested using a series of 10 exposures to UVA. The resulting erythema was measured objectively 72 h after irradiation and dose-response curves for psoralen-UVA erythema were constructed. Although the dose of 8-MOP was calculated according to body weight, patients receiving 30 mg of 8-MOP had a significantly lower mean plasma concentration than those receiving higher doses. There was no significant correlation between plasma 8-MOP concentration and minimal phototoxic dose, either estimated visually or calculated from the dose-response curves. However the slope of the dose-response curve showed significant correlation with plasma 8-MOP concentration. The variation between patients in the rate of increase of the erythemal response, but not the variation in threshold sensitivity, can be explained by difference in plasma psoralen concentration.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Immunologic and pathologic manifestations of the infection of rhesus monkeys with simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques. The striking similarities between simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-induced disease in macaque monkeys and HIV-induced disease in humans make the SIV-induced macaque monkey an extraordinarily important model for the study of AIDS. The most significant difference between these lentivirus-induced syndromes is the more rapid progression of disease in SIV-infected monkeys.

"Polymorphism and expression of the galactosyltransferase-associated protein kinase gene in normal individuals and galactosylation-defective rheumatoid arthritis patients. We used restriction endonuclease digestion of leukocyte DNA to assess the structural integrity of an N-acetylglucosamine beta 1----4 galactosyltransferase (GalTase)-associated (GTA) protein kinase gene in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. This analysis provides evidence that the gross structure of the GTA protein kinase gene locus remains intact in patients with defective galactosylation and that this gene locus is polymorphic both in normal individuals and in patients with RA, although no polymorphisms unique to RA patients were observed. Initial data on the expression of this gene indicate that comparable levels of GTA protein kinase messenger RNA are present in the lymphocytes of normal individuals and RA patients, irrespective of whether lymphocytes were obtained from patients with decreased or normal levels of galactosylation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Cicatricial pemphigoid antigen differs from bullous pemphigoid antigen by its exclusive extracellular localization: a study by indirect immunoelectronmicroscopy. Several components of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) bear the name of the autoimmune bullous disease in which they are involved. The epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) antigen, a component of anchoring fibrils, and the bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen, a component of hemidesmosomes (HD) with a molecular weight of 220-240 kD, have been well characterized. In contrast, there is little data known about the cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) antigen. No differences between CP and BP have been reported when sera of patients were studied by Western immunoblotting. Findings of a study of sera from 8 patients with CP by indirect immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) on normal human skin are reported. Saponin (0.1% 10 mn) was used as a permeabilizing agent of cytomembranes and saponin-treated skin samples were compared to saponin-untreated skin samples. Four sera from patients with BP, one from a patient with EBA, and three from healthy donors served as controls. The CP sera produced a similar staining of DEJ on both saponin-treated and saponin-untreated skin samples: immune deposits were localized over the lamina densa and the lower part of the lamina lucida clearly separated from the cytoplasmic membrane of keratinocytes, in regularly spaced clumps. The BP sera produced an intense staining of DEJ only on saponin-treated skin samples: immune deposits were observed on the cytoplasmic attachment plaque of the HD; on saponin-untreated skin samples, BP sera produced only a faint staining of the extracellular part of HD. Finally, as expected the EBA serum appeared on the lower part of the lamina densa and anchoring fibrils, and no DAB deposits were observed with the serum of healthy donors. This data indicated that CP antigen is different than BP antigen by its exclusive extracellular localization. It may be a component of anchoring filaments.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among recipients of antibody-positive blood donations  OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) transmission by antibody (anti-HIV-1)-positive blood components, and to determine the immunologic and clinical course in HIV-1-infected recipients. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We retrospectively tested approximately 200,000 donor blood component specimens stored in late 1984 and 1985 for anti-HIV-1, and we contacted recipients of positive specimens to determine their serologic status. They were compared with both recipients of HIV-1-negative transfusions and healthy (untransfused) controls. Subjects were seen at 3- to 6-month intervals for up to 4 years for clinical and immunologic evaluations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 133 recipients, 9 had other possible exposures. Excluding these cases, 111 of 124 (89.5%) were anti-HIV-1-positive (95% CI, 84.1% to 94.5%). The recipient's sex, age, underlying condition, and type of component did not influence infection rates. The cumulative risk for developing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) within 38 months after transfusion was 13% (CI, 7.5% to 21.6%). At 36 +/- 3 months after the index transfusion, seropositive recipients had lower counts of CD2+CDw26+, CD4+, CD4+CD29+, and CD4+CD45RA+subsets and more CD8+I2+ lymphocytes than did recipients of anti-HIV-1-negative transfusions. The CD4+ and CD2+CDw26+subsets changed the most rapidly. The absolute CD8+ count remained normal. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion of anti-HIV-1-positive blood infected 90% of recipients. The rate of progression to AIDS within the first 38 months after infection was similar to that reported for homosexual men and hemophiliacs. Although most lymphocyte subset counts changed over time, CD8+ counts were constant.",Virus_Diseases

"Routine human immunodeficiency virus infection screening in unregistered and registered inner-city parturients. Women who receive little or no prenatal care are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. Although many of these women are disadvantaged and presumably at increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, few data are available to describe risk behaviors and infection prevalence in this population. To better characterize HIV infection in unregistered inner-city parturients in Atlanta, we offered routine voluntary screening for HIV antibody and requested HIV risk-behavior profiles on all unregistered and registered parturients seen at Grady Memorial Hospital from July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988. Of the 834 unregistered and 7356 registered parturients screened, significantly more unregistered parturients were seropositive on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot testing, 12 (1.4%) versus 26 (0.4%) (odds ratio 4.06; 95% confidence interval 1.93-8.43). Five unregistered and 15 registered parturients were seropositive by repeat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing but were Western blot-negative. Significantly more unregistered parturients reported both a history of intravenous drug use, 4.4 versus 1.5% (odds ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 2.10-4.54), and crack cocaine use, 3 versus 0.8% (odds ratio 3.96; 95% confidence interval 2.42-6.44). Significantly more unregistered parturients acknowledged risk factors for HIV infection, 14.3 versus 9.9% (odds ratio 1.46; 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.80). Nearly all registered and 86% of unregistered parturients consented to HIV testing. Nearly all parturients completed HIV risk-behavior questionnaires. These data suggest that unregistered inner-city parturients in Atlanta are at greater risk of being HIV-infected and are more likely to report risk behaviors for infection.",Virus_Diseases

"Synthesis and release of phospholipase A2 by unstimulated human articular chondrocytes. High activity of proinflammatory, type II phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was found in synovial fluids (SF) in inflammatory arthritis. In search for the sources of this PLA2, we cultured human articular chondrocytes and cartilage explants from healthy, osteoarthritic and rheumatoid joints. All cultures, unstimulated by cytokines, released PLA2 extracellularly. Cultures obtained from the deep layers of the cartilage released more PLA2 than those obtained from the superficial layers. Deep layer explants released 0.38 to 18.16 pmol/min/mg protein PLA2/day, whereas superficial layer explants released 0.39-3.18 pmol/min/mg/day. Chondrocyte cell cultures continuously released PLA2, in the first day 909-46347 pmol/min/(10)6 cells and after 9-26 days of culture 166-2115 pmol/min/10(6) cells. PLA2 released from chondrocytes was calcium dependent and had optimum activity at pH 7.5. Cycloheximide markedly inhibited its release. Chondrocyte cultures also released muramidase (LZM) but there was no correlation between PLA2 and LZM release. It may be concluded that cytokine unstimulated human articular chondrocytes synthesize and release PLA2 extracellularly which is similar to that found in the SF. Thus, chondrocytes may possibly serve as one of the sources of intraarticular PLA2.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"A palmar dermatosis linked to occult carcinoma of the upper thorax, head and neck: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm. An unusual, persistent, corregated-to-honeycombed thickening of the palms accompanied by tenderness around the fingernails was found to be a cutaneous marker for internal malignancy. This combination of signs and symptoms has been reported under two clinical entities: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm. This paraneoplastic syndrome is of interest to head and neck surgeons due to the location of the primary tumor, the site of metastatic disease, and the ability to cure the cutaneous disease by surgical removal of the primary tumor. In our patient, a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung not detectable on chest x-ray presented as a cervical mass accompanied by cutaneous changes on the palms and fingernails. Recognition of the relationship of the dermatologic changes to malignancy of a specific body region eventually led to the detection of the primary tumor.

"Progression to AIDS among Italian HIV-seropositive haemophiliacs. Italian Group. To investigate the interval between HIV-1 infection and the development of clinical AIDS among Italian patients with congenital coagulation disorders, a national cohort study was undertaken in 1988. Information was collected both retrospectively and prospectively on 499 HIV-1-positive patients enrolled in an ongoing national registry of patients with congenital coagulation disorders. Two methods were used to estimate each patient's seroconversion date: the mid-point between the last negative (either known or estimated) and the first positive test, and the median under a Weibull distribution, which was assumed to fit seroconversion data. The two methods of estimating the seroconversion time yielded similar results. The actuarial incidence of AIDS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 12.8% (95% confidence interval = 9.7-15.9) over 7 years for Italian haemophiliacs. Progression appears to be slow in the first 5 years after the infection, and to rise steadily thereafter. A strong association between faster progression and older age at seroconversion was found. Zidovudine-treated individuals seem to have a slower progression than untreated individuals, after controlling for CD4, but there was no association between progression and type and severity of the congenital disorder.",Virus_Diseases
"The cost of home air-fluidized therapy for pressure sores. A randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND. Recurrent pressures sores are a serious problem that often cause chronically ill patients to be hospitalized. We hypothesized that home air-fluidized bed therapy may be a safe and effective way to treat these patients, thus avoiding the costs of hospitalization. METHODS. One hundred twelve patients with 3rd or 4th stage pressure sores were randomly assigned to 36 weeks of either (1) home air-fluidized bed therapy that included the services of a visiting nurse specialist as long as the patient had 3rd or 4th stage sores, or (2) conventional therapy. RESULTS. Compared with patients in the control group, patients receiving air-fluidized bed therapy spent fewer days in the hospital (11.4 days vs 25.5 days, P less than .01) and used fewer total inpatient resources, as reflected both in charges ($13,263 vs $25,736, P less than .05) and in Medicare DRG and physician payments ($6,646 vs $12,131, P less than .05). Total resources used (inpatient and outpatient) were lower for patients treated with air-fluidized bed therapy, but the difference was not statistically significant. Clinical outcomes were similar. CONCLUSIONS. Home air-fluidized bed therapy is safe, reduces hospitalizations, is no more costly than alternative therapy, and allows the patients to receive their needed care in a more desirable, nonhospital setting.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots. A mechanical or biological problem? Pathophysiologically, nerve root pain production is a complex issue. For many years, mechanical compression has been regarded as the sole cause for such pain. There are indications, however, that other factors, such as intraneural inflammation, may be of importance in this context. In this article, four cases are presented in which nerve root related pain gradually resolved without any proven change in the mechanical deformation of the involved nerve root. The data presented here suggest that mechanical compression, per se, may not always be the sole cause of radicular pain and dysfunction. These findings suggest that improvement is needed in our understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Protection from rotavirus reinfection: 2-year prospective study. To measure protection induced by natural rotavirus infection, 163 infants enrolled in a rotavirus vaccine trial were prospectively followed for 2 years. Serotype 1 rotaviruses were the predominant circulating strains during the study. Over the 2 years of observation, significantly fewer infants infected before enrollment developed a symptomatic reinfection (0 of 21) or any reinfection (4 of 21) compared with previously uninfected infants (P = .0003). Of the 60 infants who developed a primary rotavirus infection in the first year (40 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic) only 4 were reinfected in the second year compared with 29 of 82 subjects not previously infected (P = .00003). Asymptomatic primary infection appeared to be as protective as symptomatic primary infection. The only symptomatic reinfections occurred in 2 subjects who did not develop rotavirus antibody after the initial detection of rotavirus. An age-related reduction in the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic primary rotavirus infection was also detected. In this study, protection against homotypic serotype 1 reinfection appeared to last greater than or equal to 2 years.",Virus_Diseases

"High risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix for women with HLA-DQw3. Many immune responses are controlled by genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In man these include the loci encoding the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ and -DP antigens, and many diseases have been linked with these. But attempts to identify HLA genes in man that might explain why an immune response against malignant tumours should be ineffective have so far been disappointing, apart from the association reported between the HLA-DR1 antigen and a susceptibility to a rare carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Here we describe another strong connection between a common malignant tumour and an HLA antigen, namely between HLA-DQw3 and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix: from the 1988 United States tumour registry, 1 in every 63 newborn girls will develop this invasive cancer. We found that 88% of 66 patients had the leukocyte antigen HLA-DQw3 when it would normally be expected in only 50% of individuals. In animals the immune system and the MHC act in defence against virally induced tumours, but until now there has been no evidence that they do so in humans: as squamous cell carcinoma is probably virally induced, our discovery of its association with an HLA antigen will be important to the understanding of the immunogenetic basis of a susceptibility to this tumour.",Virus_Diseases
"Use of CT and MR imaging to distinguish intracranial lesions and to define the need for biopsy in AIDS patients  To explore the potential usefulness of imaging studies in the diagnosis of focal central nervous system (CNS) lesions associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the authors retrospectively examined the radiographic studies of 149 AIDS patients who presented with signs and symptoms of the three most common focal CNS lesions. Of these patients, 74 (50%) had Toxoplasma abscesses, 45 (30%) had primary CNS lymphoma, and 30 patients (20%) had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was more sensitive than computerized tomography (CT) in detecting lesions, especially in cases of PML. Whereas CT was unable to distinguish mass lesions caused by toxoplasmosis from those caused by lymphoma, 71% of the solitary lesions seen on MR images were lymphomas. These results indicate that empirical treatment for toxoplasmosis, the most common initial treatment for AIDS patients with neurological symptoms stemming from mass lesions, is not likely to be successful for patients with solitary lesions on MR images. Rather, early biopsy is advisable. If the presence of lymphoma is confirmed, the rapid initiation of treatment can allow prolonged high-quality survival.",Virus_Diseases

"Undiagnosed tuberculosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection  We describe the clinical features of 11 patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection in whom tuberculosis was undiagnosed and untreated prior to death. Most patients (9 of 11) had pulmonary complaints and 8 of 11 had roentgenographic findings suggestive of tuberculosis (hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, pleural effusion, apical infiltrate or miliary pattern). Despite these findings, tuberculin skin tests were not performed in any of the patients. Acid-fast smears of sputum were obtained in three cases and bronchoscopy performed in only four, reflecting the low index of suspicion for tuberculosis. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was the presumptive diagnosis in nine cases but was confirmed in only one case. Autopsy revealed tuberculosis as the cause of death in four patients. Of the seven patients who did not undergo autopsy, disseminated tuberculosis, manifest by mycobacteremia, was the only life-threatening illness identified and probably contributed to death. Increased awareness of the clinical and roentgenographic features of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients, combined with more intensive use of acid-fast smears and tuberculin skin testing, are necessary in order to decrease mortality from this treatable complication of HIV-infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Plasmapheresis does not increase the risk for infection in immunosuppressed patients with severe lupus nephritis. The Lupus Nephritis Collaborative Study Group. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasmapheresis increases the risk for infection in immunosuppressed patients. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Multicenter. PATIENTS: Eighty-six patients enrolled in a trial of plasmapheresis for severe diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis. INTERVENTIONS: Forty-six of the patients received high-dose steroid therapy plus cyclophosphamide therapy for 8 weeks. Thereafter, cyclophosphamide therapy was discontinued, and steroid therapy was tapered (standard treatment group). Forty patients received identical treatment and had 12 plasmapheresis procedures during the first 4 weeks of the treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were examined for the development of infection. MAIN RESULTS: No statistical difference in age, sex, race, serum creatinine level, proteinuria, or complement levels was found between the two groups. Over a follow-up period of 5376 patient-weeks, 74% of patients in the standard treatment group had 62 infections, yielding an aggregate infection rate of 1.15 infections per 100 weeks (median individual infection rate, 1.08; 25th and 75th percentiles, 0.0 and 2.44). This rate was comparable to that seen in the plasmapheresis-treated patients who were followed for 4187 patient-weeks: 68% had 51 infections, for an aggregate infection rate of 1.22 infections per 100 weeks (median individual infection rate, 0.94; 25th and 75th percentiles, 0.0 and 2.32). The infection rate was also comparable in the initial acute phase of the study, despite the fact that patients who received plasmapheresis then had significantly lower immunoglobulin (IgG) levels (P less than 0.001). Neither the site (superficial compared with systemic) nor the nature (conventional compared with unconventional) of infection differed statistically between the two groups. Of 14 patient deaths, 7 were from infection (4 in control group and 3 in the plasmapheresis group). CONCLUSION: Plasmapheresis did not increase the risk for infection in immunosuppressed patients with severe lupus nephritis.",Virus_Diseases

"Diagnosis and management of infantile marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome is infrequently diagnosed early in infancy. The experience of the authors with 22 severely affected infants diagnosed as having Marfan syndrome in the first 3 months of life is described and the literature on 32 additional infants with Marfan syndrome is reviewed. It was found that serious cardiac pathology (82% of the patients described in the article, 94% of those described in the literature) may be present at birth, and that congenital contractures (64% of our cases, 47% of literature cases) are often an associated finding. Other useful clinical findings included arachnodactyly, dolichocephaly, a characteristic facies, a high-arched palate, micrognathia, hyperextensible joints, pes planus, anterior chest deformity, iridodenesis, megalocornea, and dislocated lenses. Echocardiography was useful as a noninvasive method for defining the extent of cardiovascular involvement and following its course. Characteristic cardiac findings in early life included mitral valve prolapse, valvular regurgitation, and aortic root dilation. Cardiac function ranged from normal to poor, with a tendency to worsen. Of the 22 cases 3 infants died during the first year of life. Morbidity and mortality may be high when Marfan syndrome is diagnosed during infancy, and prompt recognition of this phenotype can facilitate management and counseling. Most such severe cases appear to be due to a sporadic mutation in a single germ cell of one parent. Many familial cases may have milder manifestations, be more difficult to detect during infancy, and have a better prognosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Blood mononuclear cells from patients with psoriasis exhibit an enhanced adherence to cultured vascular endothelium. Blood mononuclear cells (MNC) from patients with psoriasis were more adherent to monolayers of endothelial cells prepared from human umbilical cord vein than otherwise similar cells from control subjects. This increase in adherence occurred in the presence (mean 37% increase; p less than 0.01) and absence (mean 47% increase; p less than 0.05) of 10% autologous serum and was not related to the disease severity of the patients. The augmented adhesiveness of the patients' cells was also apparent when using monolayers of endothelial cells isolated from human skin. The levels of immune complexes, complement, alpha 2-macroglobulin, acute phase proteins (alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein and alpha 1-antitrypsin), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the patients' sera were within normal limits. When MNC were added to endothelial monolayers that had been incubated with either TNF alpha or the highest concentration of rIL-1 beta used in the study, both the patients' and control's cells exhibited a similar increase in attachment (p less than 0.01). Pretreatment of endothelium with interferon-gamma did not enhance the attachment of MNC from either group of subjects. The augmented adherence of the patient's MNC appears to be due to an abnormal adhesiveness of the lymphocytes rather than the monocytes and is not related to an enhanced expression of the cell-surface adhesion molecules CD11a/CD18. It is likely that the circulating MNC of psoriatic patients may be predisposed for extravasation into skin.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Antibodies to the mycobacterial 65-kd heat-shock protein are reactive with synovial tissue of adjuvant arthritic rats and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The expression of 65-kd mycobacterial heat-shock protein (HSP)-related antigens in synovial membrane from rats and humans with arthritis was studied using three monoclonal antibodies and one polyclonal antiserum directed to antigens of mycobacteria. The antibodies labeled synovial tissue sections from both adjuvant arthritis (AA) rats and from patients with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA); especially the synovial lining cells appeared to be positive. The cytoplasmic staining patterns in rats and humans were essentially the same and were not related to the extent of inflammation ie, the size of lymphoid infiltration. In control tissues no cytoplasmic staining was observed. The results suggest a role for a 65-kd HSP or a cross-reactive molecule in the immunopathologic process of arthritic disease.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Herpes simplex virus hepatitis in pregnancy. Two patients successfully treated with acyclovir. Two cases of herpes simplex virus hepatitis in pregnancy are presented. Each case was characterized by extremely high serum aminotransferase levels with minimal bilirubin elevation. In both cases, liver biopsy was instrumental in arriving at the diagnosis. In addition, computed tomography showed a radiographic appearance of the liver not characteristically seen in other hepatic disorders of pregnancy. A high index of suspicion in the second case led to early recognition and treatment. Despite the presence of fulminant liver failure and evidence of herpes encephalitis in the other case, institution of therapy with acyclovir was associated with complete recovery in both patients. The present cases are compared and contrasted with the literature. The incidence of two cases within a 6-month period suggests that herpes simplex virus hepatitis in pregnancy may occur more frequently than previously reported.",Virus_Diseases
"Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome terminating as disseminated T-cell lymphoma. The authors describe a case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) terminated as a T-cell lymphoma in a 3-year-old girl. The clinical course was chronic and characterized by chronic eczema, persistent peripheral blood eosinophilia, organomegaly, interstitial lung change, and pericarditis. Postmortem examination demonstrated a disseminated T-cell lymphoma involving the inguinal lymph node, liver, lung, and kidney. The findings of the current case suggest a possibility that certain abnormalities in this case of idiopathic HES per se may have triggered the development of malignant lymphoma, and it may represent a transition of idiopathic HES into a T-cell lymphoma. Other possible sequences are discussed. The development of T-cell malignancy in idiopathic HES in a girl is quite an unusual presentation.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Detection of anti-basement membrane zone antibodies in bullous systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe a 42-year-old black woman with long-standing systemic lupus erythematosus in whom vesiculobullous lesions developed. Routine histologic and immunologic studies fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus. Indirect immunofluorescence showed antinuclear antibodies without basement membrane zone fluorescence. We destroyed the nuclear antigens of the indirect immunofluorescence substrate with 2 mol/L sodium chloride, which unmasked basement membrane zone linear IgG staining. We also confirmed anti-basement membrane zone antibodies by employing a new technique of direct immunofluorescence on sodium chloride-split skin. Our finding prove that a thorough search for anti-basement membrane zone antibodies can be revealing. Our results support the idea that a subset of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus has the staining characteristics of epidermolysis acquisita, with the dermal side of the split skin showing linear immunoglobulin deposition.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The role of prolactin in autoimmune demyelination: suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by bromocriptine. Several lines of evidence suggest that the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin has a stimulatory role on immune function and that pharmacological suppression of prolactin secretion with the dopamine-agonist bromocriptine suppresses both humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe the effects of prolactin-suppression on the course of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in female Lewis rats. Initiation of continuous bromocriptine treatment before immunization reduced both the severity and incidence of clinical signs of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-immunized rats experienced a threefold rise in basal prolactin levels on day 4 after immunization and maintained elevated prolactin levels on day 10, before the onset of neurological signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Bromocriptine treatment reduced prolactin levels to those of sham-immunized rats. In vivo bromocriptine pretreatment inhibited splenic lymphocyte proliferative responses in vitro to the immunizing antigen and to concanavalin A. Moreover, bromocriptine therapy was protective when initiated 1 week after the initial immunization and was also effective in suppression of late disease. These results indicate that (1) prolactin levels are elevated after immunization and before the onset of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, (2) bromocriptine inhibits both prolactin secretion and the severity of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and (3) inhibition is also present when treatment is begun after sensitization, suggesting an effect of prolactin on the effector limb of the immune response during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.",Virus_Diseases
"Contact sensitization to textile dyes: description of 100 subjects. We have described 100 subjects sensitized to textile dyes. Of these, 16 had clinically been suspected of having a textile dermatitis from among 1145 patients referred for patch testing. 41 patients were identified from among 861 consecutive subjects tested with the GIRDCA (Italian Research Group on Contact and Environmental Dermatitis) standard series supplemented with 4 disperse dyes (Disperse Blue 124, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Yellow 3, Disperse Orange 3). The remaining 43 patients were identified from among 746 subjects tested with the GIRDCA standard series, supplemented with the 4 disperse dyes mentioned above and a further series of 12 other textile dyes. The clinical picture was extremely variable: most patients had a typical eczematous dermatitis, but we also observed persistent erythematous-wheal-type reactions, a transient urticarial dermatitis and an erythema-multiforme-like eruption. Among these textile dyes, Disperse Blue 124 caused most reactions. With the addition of the 4 disperse dyes to the GIRDCA standard series, we identified 4.8% sensitized to textile dyes, a much higher figure than the 1.4% observed among patients being patch tested on the basis of their history and the clinical findings; the addition of a further 12 textile dyes to the series further increased the detection rate to 5.8%. We stress the importance of routinely patch testing with textile dyes, which can help to elucidate the cause of certain kinds of atypical dermatitis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Antibodies to denatured type II collagen in rheumatoid arthritis: negative association with IgM rheumatoid factor. Serum samples from 129 patients with definite or classic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were assayed by ELISA for antibodies to denatured bovine type II collagen (dII). All patients had active disease at the time of serum sampling. Anti-dII antibodies were found in 18 (14%) of 129 patients (95% confidence intervals: 8-20%). The only clinical or laboratory feature associated with the presence of anti-dII antibodies was seronegativity for IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM RF): 6 (37.5%) of 16 seronegative patients had anti-dII antibodies vs 12 (10.6%) of the 113 seropositive patients (OR = 5, p less than 0.01). There were no associations of anti-dII antibodies with age, sex, race, disease activity, disease duration, functional class, or the presence of HLA-DR1, DR4, or DQw3 in these patients.

"Vaccination despite thimerosal sensitivity. Thimerosal sensitivity is extremely common in Austria, being surpassed as a contact allergen only by nickel. This high incidence is still rising and is probably due to the frequent vaccinations which are performed in Austria. Most of the patch-test-positive patients had recently been immunized with thimerosal-containing vaccines, and no other obvious sources of exposure to thimerosal could be found. On retrospective questioning, 48 out of 50 patients had had no problems with their recent immunization; the 2 who reported massive local reactions had received their injections, against the recommendation of the manufacturer, subcutaneously. In a prospective study, 12 thimerosal-sensitized persons received their follow-up immunization at our department, and no side effects occurred. This enables us to conclude that sensitization had occurred through vaccines, but that those amounts of thimerosal delivered i.m. are not sufficient to elicit clinical symptoms. Patch-test positivity to thimerosal thus represents no contra-indication to i.m. immunization with thimerosal-containing vaccines.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Analysis of side-effects of medium- and low-dose cyclosporin maintenance therapy in psoriasis. The side-effects of long-term cyclosporin A (CyA) treatment in 26 patients with severe psoriasis were evaluated.

There were three groups according to the dose of CyA, less than 2 mg/kg per day, 2-3 mg/kg per day and greater than 3 mg/kg per day. In all three groups, CyA was found to be equally effective. Treatment with CyA was discontinued in 12 of the 26 patients because of nephrotoxicity and/or development of hypertension. One was in the less than 2 mg/kg per day group, three were in the 2-3 mg/kg per day group and eight in the greater than 3 mg/kg per day group. There was no hepatotoxicity with CyA treatment.

"Renal disease, epidermal necrosis, and epithelial cell antibodies. OBJECTIVE--To describe the association between epithelial cell IgM, which has previously been associated with an increased incidence of loss of renal graft in children, with a novel cutaneous eruption and unexplained native renal disease. DESIGN--Observational study on children with epithelial cell antibody presenting with unexplained renal or skin disease. SETTING--General paediatric department and regional paediatric nephrology unit. PATIENTS--Six children (five girls, one boy), who presented to the unit in 1989-90. RESULTS--Three children, two of whom had a history of a hyperpigmented rash, presented with hypertension, proteinuria, and impaired renal function. Renal biopsy specimens from two of these children showed severe arteriolar endothelial cell swelling with arteriolar occlusion. These children fully recovered after treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The third child developed end stage renal failure and required dialysis. Three other children presented with an unusual cutaneous eruption but no evidence of renal disease. Histology of the skin lesions showed acute epidermal necrosis and features consistent with a viral infection. CONCLUSIONS--The aetiology and pathogenesis of the epithelial cell antibody are unknown. These cases indicate that it may have a role in native kidney disease and focal epidermal necrosis. Clinical and histological features suggest that the antibody may be associated with a viral infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Application of 1 nm gold probes on paraffin wax sections for in situ hybridisation histochemistry. An in situ hybridisation technique that uses 1 nm immunogold reagents and silver enhancement was devised to detect biotinylated DNA viral probes in formalin fixed, paraffin wax sections of human cervix. DNA probes labelled with biotin-11-deoxyuridine triphosphate were detected after hybridisation to nucleic acid sequences by an antibiotin antibody, followed by a gold labelled secondary antibody. Silver enhancement then permitted visualisation of the signal at the light microscopic level. The method was reliable and produced less background staining than previously described methods. The signal could be enhanced by epi polarisation microscopy. Furthermore, biotinylated DNA probes may be detected directly by a 1 nm gold labelled goat antibiotin antibody without loss of labelling intensity, and this may be preferable to the longer two layer technique, previously described.",Virus_Diseases
"Activation of CD16+ effector cells by rheumatoid factor complex. Role of natural killer cells in rheumatoid arthritis. The role of natural killer (NK) cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear. A pathogenetic function of rheumatoid factors (RF) also has not been defined. In the present studies, natural killer (NK) cells were examined as a model for FC gamma receptor type III-positive (FC gamma RIII+) cells, with regard to their interaction with RF. NK cell antigen CD16 (FC gamma RIII) and CD56 expression and functional NK and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity were compared in peripheral blood lymphocytes and autologous synovial fluid lymphocytes (SFL) of RA patients. Peripheral blood lymphocytes and SFL showed normal CD56 expression. In contrast, both the frequency and the density of CD16 antigen were decreased in SFL. Furthermore, diminished NK cytotoxicity and a significant decrease in ADCC were observed in SF NK cells. In subsequent in vitro studies with normal fresh NK cells, it was demonstrated that IgG-containing RF complexes from RA patients induced a modulation of FC gamma RIII structure from the NK cell surface, a decrease in NK activity, and a complete loss of ADCC. When purified RF was incubated with NK-enriched cell lines from RA patients, increased transcription and subsequent production of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha were observed. These data suggest a direct involvement of RF complexes in the pathogenetic process of chronic inflammation in RA.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Lymphocyte adhesion to psoriatic dermal endothelium: mechanism and modulation. Psoriasis is characterized by the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes in the epidermis and the accumulation of activated CD4+ T lymphocytes in the upper dermis. We have recently tested the hypothesis that the abnormal endothelial proliferation in the dermal papillae of psoriatic lesions may be mechanistically linked to the expression of endothelial ligands capable of promoting lymphocytes binding and extravasation. The results indicated that specialized endothelial cells lining the post-capillary venules of psoriatic lesions are capable of promoting the selective adherence of human CD4+ T cells and its memory subset. In contrast, B cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD45RA+ T cells are deficient in their capacities to bind. The adhesion process is energy and calcium dependent and involves tissue-specific lymphocyte receptors, with LFA-1 molecules playing an accessory role. We concluded that transformation of the dermal endothelium into a lymphocyte-receptive phenotype by defined growth factors or cytokines may represent a positive feedback mechanism promoting lymphocyte migration into the diseased sites.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Diagnostic accuracy and appropriateness of care for seborrheic keratoses. A pilot study of an approach to quality assurance for cutaneous surgery  In 1985 there were more than 40 million visits for ambulatory surgical procedures in the United States. Although benign cutaneous lesions are among the most frequent conditions to receive surgical treatment in ambulatory settings, their treatment is seldom subject to peer review. In this pilot study we assessed diagnostic accuracy and appropriateness of care using information available from the surgical pathology laboratory. We assessed these two measures of physician performance for 527 seborrheic keratoses removed by 133 clinicians affiliated with four different institutions. Overall, a correct preoperative diagnosis was provided in only 49% of cases. Dermatologists had the highest diagnostic accuracy (61% vs 35% for all other physicians). An appropriate procedure for the actual pathological diagnosis was performed in only 50% of cases. Lesions with a correct preoperative diagnosis were more than eight times more likely to receive appropriate care. Our data suggest that many clinicians fail to note a correct diagnosis of common cutaneous lesions before surgical removal, and many patients are treated with procedures that are more invasive than necessary for the final pathological diagnosis. Because the approach used in this pilot study relies on data already available, it has promise as a low-cost method of monitoring the quality of care of ambulatory surgery.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Viral vaccines for the prevention of childhood pneumonia in developing nations: priorities and prospects. In concert with bacteria, respiratory viruses play a major role in the high rates of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) experienced in developing nations. Respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and influenza viruses, and the adenoviruses are the predominant viral causes of ALRI in both developed and developing regions. In this review, the epidemiologic data from developing nations for these viral infections are summarized and the current status of viral vaccines for prevention of ALRI are described. Among the questions to be addressed before these vaccines are used in developing nations are (1) the age-specific rates of infection and disease, (2) the effect of high-dose early exposure to these viruses, and (3) the effect of malnutrition on the immunogenicity of the vaccines. Prospective family studies and other community-based approaches will be required in the acquisition of these data.",Virus_Diseases
"Relationship between AIDS latency period and AIDS survival time in homosexual and bisexual men. We identified 277 homosexual and bisexual men diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) whose estimated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion dates, ranging from 1977-85, could be well approximated. These men were from a cohort of 6,705 homosexual and bisexual men originally recruited for studies of sexually transmitted hepatitis B in San Francisco in 1978-80. We compared the time from HIV seroconversion to the initial disease diagnostic of AIDS (AIDS latency period) with the time from first AIDS diagnosis to death (AIDS survival time) and found no significant overall correlation between latency period and survival time. Both Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard stepwise analyses found the initial AIDS diagnosis to be significantly associated with latency period, with individuals first diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) having a shorter latency but longer survival than those first diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) or other AIDS diagnoses. Individuals with KS tended to be diagnosed earlier in the epidemic compared to those with PCP and other non-KS diagnoses. The AIDS survival time was significantly associated with the initial AIDS diagnosis but not with the estimated year of seroconversion, the year of first AIDS diagnosis, age at seroconversion, or racial/ethnic group. The information presented here on the relationship between the AIDS latency period and survival times suggests a model for the pathogenesis of HIV infection in which there is continual deterioration of the immune system. The wider use of antiviral and prophylactic therapies both preceding and following a diagnosis of AIDS may change this model as both latency and survival times are improved.",Virus_Diseases
"Pregnancy and the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. There have been conflicting reports on, and no plausible biologic explanation for, a protective effect of oral contraceptive (OC) use on the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, we investigated aspects of behavior related to OC use that could explain the preventive effect of OC on the onset of RA. In the present case-control study, past pregnancy, age at first pregnancy, and pregnancies with adverse outcome were studied as possible risk factors for RA. Interview information on reproductive variables was obtained from 135 young adult women with confirmed definite or classic RA of recent onset, and from 378 control patients with soft tissue rheumatic disorders or osteoarthritis. All patients had at least 2 years of followup to confirm the consistency of the diagnosis. We found a decreased risk of RA in women who had been pregnant. The risk of RA in women who had ever been pregnant compared with women who had never been pregnant was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.27-0.91). The earlier the first pregnancy, the lower the risk of RA. Pregnancy with adverse outcome (i.e., gestation less than 25 weeks) did not substantially change the risk of RA (relative risk 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.50-1.07). The protective effect of pregnancy was independent of OC use, the presence of HLA-DR4, or a family history of RA.

"Endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) expression in cutaneous inflammation. Endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) is a recently described endothelial surface glycoprotein which is inducible by interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Using an immunohistochemical technique and a monoclonal antibody (1.2B6) specific for ELAM-1 we have found marked vascular endothelial expression of ELAM-1 in many cutaneous inflammatory disorders, including allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, and in dermal infiltrates associated with benign, premalignant and malignant keratinocyte proliferation. In normal skin, minimal levels of ELAM-1 expression were detected. In psoriasis, double-immunoenzyme staining studies revealed a close spatial relationship between ELAM-1 expression and neutrophil margination, suggesting a functional link. Recombinant human interferon-gamma (30 micrograms) injected intradermally in normal adult human volunteers did not substantially upregulate ELAM-1 in contrast to its marked effect on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression, indicating that this cytokine is probably not involved in ELAM-1 induction in vivo. These results indicate that ELAM-1 is widely induced in cutaneous inflammation with a time course of expression that is longer than that observed in vitro. As ELAM-1 acts as an adhesion ligand for neutrophils, and perhaps monocytes, the expression of this molecule in cutaneous lesions is likely to be an indication of the ability of vascular endothelium to recruit these cells from the circulation. Furthermore, the cytokine inducibility of ELAM-1 is indirect evidence for functional interactions between perivascular mononuclear cells, other resident cells and the blood vessel wall.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Psychiatric illness in patients with chronic fatigue and those with rheumatoid arthritis  OBJECTIVES: To identify psychiatric differences between patients with chronic fatigue and those with rheumatoid arthritis and to investigate whether patients meeting Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) can be differentiated from patients with chronic fatigue on measures of disability and psychosocial distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study comparing 98 patients with chronic fatigue with 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis on structured psychiatric interviews and patient questionnaires. Nineteen patients meeting CDC criteria for CFS were compared with 79 patients with chronic fatigue not meeting CDC criteria on questionnaires measuring disability and psychosocial distress. SETTING: Consecutive patients with chronic fatigue were selected from a chronic fatigue clinic at the University of Washington, and 31 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis were sampled from a private rheumatology practice. MAIN RESULTS: Patients with chronic fatigue had a significantly higher prevalence of lifetime major depression and somatization disorder than did patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with chronic fatigue also had a significantly higher prevalence of current and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Only 19 of 98 patients with chronic fatigue met CDC criteria for CFS. Patients meeting CDC criteria for CFS could not be differentiated from the larger group of patients with chronic fatigue on any study variable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic fatigue have a significantly higher burden of psychiatric illness than do patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The psychiatric illness preceded the development of chronic fatigue in over half the patients. Centers for Disease Control criteria for CFS did not select a subset of chronic fatigue patients who could be differentiated on disability or psychosocial parameters from patients with chronic fatigue who did not meet CDC criteria.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
Variation in sperm penetration assay related to viral illness.

"Expression of the Blast-1 activation/adhesion molecule and its identification as CD48. We have analyzed the induction and expression of Blast-1 at the mRNA and protein levels and demonstrated its identity with CD48. Blast-1/CD48 is expressed on a wider range of cell types, notably T cells and monocytes, than previously thought, but appears to be restricted to lymphoid and myeloid cells. Resting B and T cells express Blast-1/CD48 molecules at the cell surface; however, they lack the epitope recognized by the 17D6 mAb. Resting B cells express no detectable Blast-1/CD48 mRNA. Induction by EBV infection or stimulation with PMA, IL-4, or PHA results in increased levels of Blast-1/CD48 protein (both 6.28 and 17D6 epitopes) at the cell surface. Detailed analysis of EBV-induced expression revealed that it is due to increased steady-state levels of Blast-1/CD48 mRNA induced by transforming but not nontransforming strains of the virus. Induction by IL-1 beta, ionomycin, or suboptimal levels of PMA plus ionomycin results in increased expression of the 17D6 epitope only. In transfected Cos-7 cells Blast-1/CD48 at the cell surface expresses only the 6.28 epitope, whereas cytoplasmic molecules express both 17D6 and 6.28 epitopes. We suggest that these results are most consistent with the idea that Blast-1/CD48 molecules are complexed at the surface of resting cells and Cos-7 cells, resulting in masking of the 17D6 epitope. Activation causes dissociation of the complex, revealing the 17D6 epitope. The existence of 17D6+6.28- Blast-1/CD48 molecules was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation analysis, which also revealed that, unlike the rest of the molecules, this subset was resistant to digestion with glyosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.",Virus_Diseases
"Efficacy of high voltage pulsed current for healing of pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of high voltage pulsed direct current (HVPC) for healing of pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury. Seventeen patients having pressure ulcers in the pelvic region were randomly assigned to either an HVPC group or a placebo HVPC group. Treatments were given for 1 hour a day for 20 consecutive days. The HVPC protocol consisted of an aluminum-foil electrode placed over the ulcer and set at negative polarity in reference to the dispersive electrode placed on the thigh. Stimulator frequency was set at 100 pps, and an intensity of 200 V was used. Measurements of ulcer surface area were conducted before treatment and after treatment days 5, 10, 15, and 20. To measure ulcer area (in square millimeters), slides taken at each measurement time were projected at actual size, traced, and digitized. Percentage of change compared with pretreatment ulcer size was calculated for each measurement time. Ulcers in the HVPC group demonstrated significantly greater percentage-of-change decreases from their pretreatment size than did ulcers in the placebo group at days 5, 15, and 20. The results suggest that HVPC, in conjunction with good nursing care, can significantly increase the healing rate of pelvic ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"In situ evidence for HPV 16, 18, 33 integration in cervical squamous cell cancer in Britain and South Africa. In a previous study three types of HPV signal were described in CIN. It was suggested that a type 1 signal represented episomal HPV while a type 2 signal represented integrated HPV; and a type 3 signal was indicative of both episomal and integrated HPV. To test this hypothesis 91 squamous cell cancers (SCC) of the cervix from Britain and South Africa were examined for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35. Of the South African group (n = 69) 64% contained HPV types 16 (n = 29) and 18 (n = 15). The SCC in the British group (n = 22) contained HPV 16 and HPV 33 in 12 and three cases, respectively. Of the HPV positive biopsy specimens, 86% showed a type 2 signal in keratinising and non-keratinising tumours and the remainder a type 3 signal. Type 3 signal was present only in keratinising tumours. The presence of punctate signal in 100% of HPV containing SCC, together with localisation of HPV signal to sister chromatids in tumour cell mitotic figures in vivo, provides further evidence for type 2, and the punctate component of type 3 signal representing viral integration.",Virus_Diseases

"Pentoxifylline inhibits the proliferation of human fibroblasts derived from keloid, scleroderma and morphoea skin and their production of collagen, glycosaminoglycans and fibronectin. Pentoxifylline, an analogue of the methylxanthine theobromine, inhibits the proliferation and certain biosynthetic activities of fibroblasts derived from normal human skin. Fibroblasts from the skin of patients with keloids, scleroderma and morphoea were cultured in vitro in the presence and absence of pentoxifylline (100-1000 micrograms/ml) to determine whether it inhibits fibroblast proliferation and the production of collagen, glycosaminoglycans (GAG), fibronectin and collagenase activity. The exposure of subconfluent fibroblast cultures to pentoxifylline resulted in non-lethal, dose-dependent reductions in serum-driven fibroblast proliferation, with 1000 micrograms/ml pentoxifylline virtually negating the proliferative effect of serum on the cells. The fibroblasts assayed as confluent cultures produced reduced amounts, by up to 95%, of collagen and GAG, dependent on the concentration of pentoxifylline, both in the presence and absence of serum. Pentoxifylline similarly inhibited the fibronectin production by keloid and scleroderma fibroblasts, but had no effect on collagenase activity.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Regional variation in the expression of pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus erythematosus, and pemphigus vulgaris antigens in human skin. The expression of the pemphigus foliaceus (PF), pemphigus erythematosus (PE), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) antigens in 16 different regions of normal human skin was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence by using sera with a high titer of PF, PE, and PV antibodies. Regional variations were observed in the expression of all these antigens. The expression of the PF and PE antigens, as measured by endpoint titer of antibody reactivity, was highest in skin specimens obtained from the upper torso, and lowest in those from the buccal mucosa, lower torso, and scalp. This distribution pattern differed from that of PV antigen, whose expression was highest in buccal mucosa and scalp. These patterns correlate with, and may provide a partial explanation for, the different distribution of skin lesions in these different forms of pemphigus.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"A VH clonal deficit in human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals reflects a B-cell maturational arrest. A major feature of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is disordered B-cell function, which paradoxically includes both pathologic overactivity (elevated serum antibodies, lymphadenopathy, and increased risk for lymphoma) and underactivity (impaired antibody immunity, particularly to bacterial polysaccharide antigens). B-cell immune dysfunction contributes significantly to HIV-related morbidity and also represents an obstacle to eventual definitive treatment by anti-HIV immunization. Our laboratory has recently identified in normal B-cell populations certain VH gene subfamilies with a developmentally regulated pattern of utilization. In particular, B cells bearing rearranged VH3L were rare in the germinal center but uniformly abundant in the blood and lymphoid mantle zone. We used this index gene subfamily as a clonal criterion for the pattern of B-cell development in lymphocytes of HIV-positive individuals. In a series of 19 HIV-positive subjects, a striking deficit of VH3L B cells was observed; in contrast, none of the 16 normal subjects showed this abnormality. Other VH subfamilies (VH1N, VH4/6, and VH5N) were unaffected in the HIV-positive patients. This VH3L clonal deficit and other recent phenotype and histopathologic findings suggest that the general B-cell dysfunction in HIV is due to a discreet maturational arrest at the germinal center stage.",Virus_Diseases
"Fine-needle aspiration evaluation of lymphoproliferative lesions in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. A multiparameter approach. Forty-six fine-needle aspirates of lymphoproliferative lesions from 31 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients were reviewed using cytomorphologic, immunocytochemical, flow cytometric (FCM), cytogenetic, and molecular studies. There were 29 lymphomas (15 small non-cleaved cell [SNCL], 11 large cell [LCL], one small lymphocytic, and two Hodgkin's), 14 reactive hyperplasias, and three ""atypical lymphoid proliferations."" The reactive hyperplasias were characteristically polymorphic and polyclonal lymphoid populations; six of seven were diploid on FCM, the seventh was hypodiploid. Higher proliferative indices (mean, 11.6%) and higher RNA indices (mean, 1.2) characterized this subgroup compared with published reactive lymphoid hyperplasias from patients without HIV positivity. Aspirates of SNCL showed monotonous populations of intermediate-sized cells except in one patient where a giant cell syncytial variant occurred. Nine of 13 SNCL aspirates showed light chain restriction. JH rearrangement revealed B-cell lineage in one aspirate in which immunocytochemical study was negative for Kappa, lambda, B1, and Leu-4. Nine of 12 SNCL were diploid; the mean proliferative index was 25.6% and the mean RNA index 2.3. Chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc locus were demonstrated in five of seven SNCL aspirates karyotyped. Five of eight LCL showed light chain restriction the remaining three showed null cell phenotype. Large cell lymphomas were diploid on tetraploid with the mean proliferative index of 22.0% and mean RNA index of 2.2. One of two LCL aspirates karyotyped demonstrated c-myc translocation. Despite the multiparameter approach, a definitive diagnosis could not be reached in three aspirates.",Virus_Diseases
"Androscopy for anogenital HPV  BACKGROUND. Strong evidence now links anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia to the transmission of the human papillomavirus (HPV) through sexual intercourse. While there is increasing research on women with this disease, less is known about their male sexual partners. METHODS. Male patients whose female sexual partners had been diagnosed as having anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia were recruited for the study. The genital regions of the male patients were examined and biopsied with the aid of a colposcope after application of a 5% acetic acid solution. Treatment was based on the specific findings in each patient. RESULTS. Genital lesions were found on 65% of the male patients examined, even though no disease had been detected by the individual. Seventy-nine percent of patients who were compliant with the prescribed treatment protocol had no detectable HPV-related lesions at the time of their last androscopic examination. CONCLUSIONS. Magnified examination of the male genitalia using an androscope following the application of 5% acetic acid solution is an effective method by which the primary care physician can detect and treat male HPV-related anogenital lesions.",Virus_Diseases
"Human monoclonal anti-basement membrane zone antibodies derived from virally transformed lymphocytes of a patient with bullous pemphigoid recognize epitopes associated with hemidesmosomes. The purpose of this study was to determine the ultrastructural localization of the epitopes recognized by two human monoclonal antibodies designated 5E and 10D, that were derived from virally transformed lymphocytes from a patient with bullous pemphigoid (BP). Previous immunoblotting showed that 5E but not 10D reacted with a 230-kDa protein in extracts of normal human skin. In the present study, indirect immunofluorescence showed that both 5E and 10D bound to the epidermal side of 1 M NaCl-separated normal human skin. Immunoperoxidase electron microscopy showed that 5E and 10D formed discontinuous focal deposits along the basal region of the epidermal basal cells in normal human skin in a similar localization to that seen with whole BP sera. Post-embedding immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated binding of both monoclonal antibodies to the intracellular components of hemidesmosomes. As far as we are aware, 5E and 10D are the first monoclonal antibodies to be described that recognize epitopes of BP antigen associated with hemidesmosomes and should serve as useful probes for future studies.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Resistance to infection by HIV-1 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1-infected patients is probably mediated by neutralizing antibodies. We have investigated whether PBMC of HIV-1-seropositive subjects are as susceptible to in vitro infection by HIV-1 as are PBMC from seronegative controls. Accordingly, stimulated PBMC from 19 HIV-1-infected subjects were inoculated with four different variants of HIV-1. None of these cultures produced either detectable quantities of viral reverse transcriptase activity or p24 Ag following inoculation with HIV-1. In contrast, in five of six cases in which these PBMC were depleted of B cells by antibody plus complement prior to viral inoculation, the presence of viral reverse transcriptase and p24 Ag was detected. The presence of normal levels of CD4-Ag at the surface of the CD4+ cells in these populations was established by flow cytometry. Analysis by an immunoblot assay revealed that anti-HIV antibodies were present in the sera obtained from these infected donors; in addition, 7 of 10 culture fluids derived from the nondepleted PBMC were shown to contain virus-neutralizing antibodies. Cultures which were depleted of B cells did not contain detectable levels of antiviral antibodies. Confirmation that the virus produced by the PBMC which had been depleted of B cells was of the strain used to infect the cultures, rather than that which initially caused patient infection, was provided on the basis of differential susceptibility to antibody neutralization. These results suggest that antibodies produced by B cells in cultures of PBMC from seropositive donors may restrict infection by HIV-1 of such cultures under laboratory conditions.",Virus_Diseases

"Patch test responses to rockwool of different diameters evaluated by cutaneous blood flow measurement. Rockwool is a man-made mineral fiber used mainly for insulation, which can cause mechanical skin irritation. This study was performed to evaluate the irritant potential of rockwools of different diameters and to compare the change of blood flow, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry, at different patch test occlusion times with rockwools. Rockwool A (mean diameter 4.20 +/- 1.96 mu) was more irritating than rockwool B (mean diameter 3.20 +/- 1.5 mu). The difference was more clearly observed in a 48-h patch test than in an 8-h or 24-h test. We concluded that laser Doppler blood flow measurement was a useful experimental tool for the evaluation of irritant patch test responses to mechanical irritants like rockwool, and that 48 h or more of occlusion time was necessary to produce irritant patch test responses to certain types of rockwool.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Intralesional interferon gamma treatment for keloids and hypertrophic scars. Keloids and hypertrophic scars are characterized by excessive collagen formation. Interferon gamma is a lymphokine that can down-regulate collagen synthesis in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, has potential therapeutic benefit in the management of abnormal scars. Intralesional scar injections of interferon gamma were performed to determine the tolerance toxicity and to obtain preliminary evidence for the efficacy of this treatment in the management of hypertropic and keloid lesions. All scars decreased in linear dimensions and flattened out. Five of 10 scars studied decreased at least 50% in linear dimensions. Interferon gamma can safely be administered intralesionally once per week up to a dosage of 0.05 mg for 10 weeks with no serious toxic effects.

"Expression of the interleukin 6 gene in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. A number of fibroblastoid synovial cell lines have been established from rheumatoid joints. These cell lines were shown to express the interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene constitutively, and exposure of these cells to 5 ng/ml of recombinant human interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) increased IL-6 gene expression. Other recombinant human lymphokines, namely interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor had no enhancing effect on IL-6 gene expression. Dexamethasone added to the cultures at 10(-7) M concentration suppressed the constitutive expression of the IL-6 gene. At a concentration of 10(-5) M, dexamethasone partially suppressed the IL-1 enhanced expression of IL-6. The IL-6 gene probe also hybridized to RNA from unfractionated synovial fluid cells, peripheral blood T cells and non-T cells but not Epstein-Barr virus transformed peripheral blood B cells of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Our results suggest that in rheumatoid arthritis, synovial fibroblasts actively participate in joint inflammation by lymphokine production. The coexpression of both IL-1 and IL-6 by one synovial fibroblast line suggests a mechanism for the perpetuation of synovitis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) effectively inhibits retrovirus replication in vitro and simian immunodeficiency virus infection in rhesus monkeys. 9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the in vitro replication of a number of retroviruses, including HIV-1 and HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian AIDS-related virus (SRV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV). PMEA causes a dose-dependent suppression of the induction of anti-SIVmacgp120 antibodies in SIV mac-infected rhesus monkeys. Complete suppression of anti-SIVmacgp120 antibodies was achieved in SIV-infected animals treated with PMEA at 2 x 10 or 2 x 5 mg/kg per day for 29 days. No toxic side-effects were noted during this treatment period. Antibodies against SIVmac gp120 appeared 1-2 weeks after PMEA treatment was stopped, but the antibody titre reached in these animals was significantly lower than in the SIVmac-infected animals who had not been treated with PMEA. Our data strongly suggest that PMEA should be pursued for its potential in the treatment of AIDS and other retrovirus infections.",Virus_Diseases
"Assessment of a contact-plate sampling technique and subsequent quantitative bacterial studies in atopic dermatitis. The aerobic bacterial flora of 20 patients with atopic dermatitis and 19 control subjects was extensively sampled using the Williamson and Kligman scrub technique and a contact-plate method (cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient media). Comparison of the two quantitative techniques showed that the contact plate is a reliable and convenient alternative to the scrub technique for the quantification of Staphylococcus aureus, micrococci and coagulase negative staphylococci. Quantification of bacterial flora using both techniques showed high rates of colonization by S. aureus on both involved and clinically normal skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. A linear increase in S. aureus counts with increasing severity of dermatitis was found.

Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) and pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) are related benign disorders without recognized association with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). We report the cases of two children with documented PLEVA evolving into CTCL over several years. One child had the clinical lesions of PLC but the dermatopathologic findings of PLEVA at age 2 years. At age 12 years, he had skin changes of poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare and dermatopathologic findings consistent with parapsoriasis en plaque. The second child presented at age 7 years with scaling dermatitis and dermatopathologic findings of PLEVA. At age 12 years, the histologic diagnosis was parapsoriasis. Monoclonal antibody studies performed on biopsy specimens from both patients revealed 70% to 100% cells staining with CD5, 80% to 90% staining with CD4, 30% to 50% staining with CD8, and an increase in CD1-staining cells in the papillary dermis, indicating a predominantly helper T-cell infiltrate.

"Reversibility of blue-gray cutaneous discoloration from amiodarone. A 45-year-old man had severe blue-gray cutaneous discoloration during amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation. Therefore, this drug regimen was discontinued, and long-term anticoagulation and digoxin therapy were used. The patient was advised to avoid exposure of his skin to sunlight, and a bleaching agent was prescribed. After 18 months of follow-up, the blue-gray hyperpigmentation had diminished. Although photosensitivity reactions from amiodarone occur in more than 50% of patients, blue-gray cutaneous discoloration occurs in less than 10% of patients on prolonged therapy with amiodarone. The presence of high concentrations of iodine, detected by electron probe analysis, suggests that the cutaneous deposits are amiodarone itself or a metabolite. The slow rate of elimination of amiodarone and a high uptake by fat-associated tissues may explain the delayed disappearance of cutaneous photosensitivity and late resolution of the blue-gray discoloration. Our current case supports the reversibility of these adverse effects on long-term follow-up.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Endothelin, an endothelial-dependent vasoconstrictor in scleroderma. Enhanced production and profibrotic action. The vascular endothelium is an important functional unit in the regulation of the vascular and perivascular environment. Various chemical and physical stimuli mediate an endothelial-dependent vasoconstriction through the release of endothelial soluble factors, such as the recently recognized endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor peptide called endothelin. The presence of circulating endothelin and the effect of cold exposure on plasma endothelin levels were investigated in patients with scleroderma and in healthy control subjects. Radioimmunoassay demonstrated a mean +/- SD plasma level of 10.7 +/- 7.3 pg/ml in the patients (n = 19) and 3.7 +/- 2 in the control subjects (n = 16) (P less than 0.005). These levels were also assessed in 5 control subjects and 5 scleroderma patients before and after 30 minutes of total body cooling (to 15 degrees C). The endothelin level did not change significantly in either group; however, 2 scleroderma patients showed a significant increase after cooling. The effects of endothelin on fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis were evaluated in order to assess the impact of released endothelin on the interstitium. A significant mitogenic effect and a collagen synthesis-enhancing effect, which were dose-dependent, were seen. The strong, characteristically prolonged, vasoconstrictor activity coupled with the profibrotic effect demonstrated here make it likely that disturbances in the control of endothelin production can contribute to the pathogenesis of scleroderma.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Chronic encephalitis caused by leukoencephalopathy. As mentioned previously, both MS and PML are demyelinating conditions of the CNS and pose diagnostic difficulties in their differentiation because of similarities in their clinical findings. However, certain features unique to each of these diseases are helpful in clinical diagnosis. MS, unlike PML, is a disease of unknown cause. Polygenetic influences in combination with exposure to an environmental agent and immune-mediated factors may be operative in the pathogenesis of MS. Age of onset peaks in the third to fourth decades with a predominance in women, as contrasted with PML, which peaks in the fifth to sixth decades in most non-AIDS-associated cases with a slight predominance in men. MS is more prevalent in areas farther from the equator: North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Common initial symptoms seen in MS include bilateral limb weakness (with the legs being affected twice as often as the arms), hyperreflexia, spasticity, optic neuritis, diplopia, incoordination, and paresthesias. (Paresthesias are typically found in the lower limbs in a symmetric pattern, but may follow no obvious anatomic distribution and often do not correspond to the distribution of sensory symptoms. Vibration and position sense are more frequently disturbed than pain and temperature.) Intellectual impairment and mental deterioration are uncommon early in MS, whereas they are a more frequent initial presentation in PML. In addition, the presence of speech impairment and monoparesis or hemiparesis with homonymous hemianopsia is more suggestive of PML. Brain stem involvement is infrequent.",Virus_Diseases
"A study of HTLV-I and its associated risk factors in Trinidad and Tobago. Seroprevalence of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I) among a sample of persons selected from a government register of businesses in Trinidad was 3.2% in 1,025 persons of African descent compared to 0.2% among 487 persons of Asian descent and 0% among 46 persons of European-descent. In Tobago, from a coastal village, among persons of African ancestry ascertained as part of a cardiovascular survey, the rate was 11.4%, which was significantly higher when corrected for age and race than the rate in Trinidad. The seroprevalence rate of antibodies to hepatitis A and B was also significantly elevated in Tobago compared to Trinidad. HTLV-I seroprevalence rates were higher in females than males while hepatitis A and B rates were not significantly different in the two sexes. For males, age was a significant determinant of HTLV-I seropositivity, while for females, age, markers of poor sanitation, and hepatitis B were each independently linked to HTLV-I seropositivity. The frequent occurrence of multiple infectious exposures in persons of lower socioeconomic circumstances in this tropical environment may result in immune activation that heightens susceptibility to HTLV-I infection.",Virus_Diseases
"Does prematurity alter the course of respiratory syncytial virus infection? We compared previously healthy prematurely born infants with full-term infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection to evaluate the role of prematurity on the clinical course of the illness.

No differences were found in the presenting symptoms of respiratory distress, cough, fever or shock, although the premature group was more likely to present with apnea (p less than .001). Chest roentgenograms revealed that premature infants had a higher incidence of atelectasis/infiltrate and hyperinflation (p less than .05). Premature infants had longer hospital stays as well as a higher Physiologic Stability Index and Therapeutic Intervention Score (p less than .001). They were also more likely to receive supplemental oxygen, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and nothing by mouth status (p less than .001).

Similarly, neutralizing antibody was detected in fecal extracts from none of three experimentally infected human volunteers and only 1 of 15 naturally infected humans. The single positive human specimen contained occult blood. Only 2 of 19 saliva samples from naturally infected humans had significant viral neutralizing activity. In contrast, neutralizing antibody to type 2 poliovirus was present in most human fecal or saliva specimens tested.

"Epstein-Barr virus and persistent graft dysfunction after liver transplantation. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, depending on the immune status of the host. In this report, we describe two liver transplant patients who received hepatic allografts from donors serologically positive for Epstein-Barr virus and who experienced primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus associated with prolonged liver graft dysfunction. In both patients, Epstein-Barr serologies converted within 3 mo of liver transplantation, and hepatic histological study revealed mononuclear infiltration of the sinusoids evolving to pronounced immunoblastic features suggestive of evolving lymphoma. In both cases, in situ hybridization studies confirmed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus genome in the liver. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA were present in biopsy specimens obtained during the episode of acute hepatitis that followed Epstein-Barr virus seroconversion. The degree of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated by polymerase chain reaction appeared to increase in parallel with the progression of parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates. In one patient, a biopsy sample from a cervical node also revealed high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Furthermore, in these patients, Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels appeared to decrease dramatically after discontinuing azathioprine administration and beginning treatment with acyclovir. These two cases illustrate the dynamics of Epstein-Barr virus immune regulation and confirm chronic hepatic allograft dysfunction related to Epstein-Barr viral infection.",Virus_Diseases

"Constitutive production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha from spontaneously proliferating T cells in patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I/II. The human T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) type I and type II are capable of inducing a variety of cellular genes, including many of the cytokines that regulate cell proliferation. To determine if the spontaneous proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients infected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II was related to coordinate expression of cytokines, we analyzed the levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-tau (IFN-tau) in culture supernatants derived from spontaneously proliferating cells. Significantly elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were present in culture supernatants from HTLV-I/II-infected individuals when compared with normal controls (P less than .01). Kinetic experiments showed that both IL-6 and TNF-alpha were elevated by day 5. None of the other cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, and IFN-tau) were detectable in any of the culture.

Using the Kaplan-Meier survival methods, we demonstrate a substantial decrease in the proportion of time spent in the hospital by patients newly diagnosed with AIDS (from 49% to 25%) in the latter study period. Treatment with zidovudine (ZDV), estimated only for 1988, emphasizes this trend even more. A reduction in hospital use also occurred for AIDS-related complex (ARC) and persistent general lymphadenopathy (PGL) patients.

The defects in type I collagen structure or synthesis that produce all four types of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type VII and the defects in type III collagen structure in EDS type IV can be detected by analysis of collagens produced by fibroblastic cells cultured from affected individuals. Quantitative defects in synthesis of type I collagen are seen in OI type I and qualitative defects of type I collagen characterize OI type II, OI type III, and OI type IV and EDS type VII. EDS type IV results from qualitative type III collagen defects. All of the disorders are inherited typically in an autosomal dominant fashion so that recurrence among offspring of normal parents usually results from germline mosaicism for the mutation in one parent. Analysis of type I and type III collagen synthesized by cultured chorionic villus cells is used for prenatal diagnosis of these disorders.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Excessive sweating: an uncommon sign of basilar artery occlusion. Excessive sweating of the face and, to a lesser degree, of the thorax and limbs, occurred after basilar artery occlusion in a 15 year old Saudi boy.

"Fertility parameters in men infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection on semen parameters that assess fertility was investigated in 50 semen specimens from 21 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic HIV-seropositive men and 3 specimens from 3 men with AIDS. HIV was isolated from 15 (30%) of 50 specimens from asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic persons and from 1 of 3 specimens from patients with AIDS. The men with AIDS all had pyosemia and grossly abnormal sperm. In contrast, semen specimens from other seropositive men did not differ significantly from semen specimens from healthy seronegative semen donors. No abnormality in sperm count, morphology, numbers or types of leukocytes in semen, or other seminal parameters was associated with HIV shedding in semen. Zidovudine therapy did not affect sperm morphology or seminal characteristics. Thus, although patients with AIDS had abnormal semen, the laboratory parameters that assess fertility were not affected by shedding of HIV in semen or concomitant therapy with zidovudine.",Virus_Diseases
"Acquired epidermolysis bullosa with the clinical feature of Brunsting-Perry cicatricial bullous pemphigoid. A 56-year-old woman with the typical clinical feature of cicatricial bullous pemphigoid of the Brunsting-Perry type was studied. Histologic examination of a lesion skin biopsy specimen demonstrated a subepidermal blister. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy revealed linear deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 located on both the roof and the floor of the blister. Immunofluorescence antigen mapping using cryostat sections of a spontaneous blister and antisera against defined basement membrane components localized the bullous pemphigoid antigen and type IV collagen in the roof of the blister. This dermal type of blister formation was confirmed by electron microscopy, which showed the cleavage level below the lamina densa. In direct immunoelectron microscopy, granular deposits of C3 and IgG were found attached to and just beneath the lamina densa in a pattern identical to the distribution of anchoring fibrils. These findings are diagnostic of acquired epidermolysis bullosa, a blistering disease that has much more clinical heterogeneity than previously suggested.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus destroys the subpopulation of Kupffer cells involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of lactate dehydrogenase and other enzymes. In previous experiments in rats, we have shown that the rapid plasma clearance of a number of clinically important enzymes is due to receptor-mediated endocytosis by Kupffer cells and other resident macrophages. Others have shown that infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, a virus that proliferates in macrophages, leads to reduced plasma elimination of these enzymes. This paper integrates these two sets of experiments. Plasma elimination of intravenously injected, radioactively labeled lactate dehydrogenase M4 and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase in mice was shown to be caused in part by uptake in liver, spleen and bone. Uptake of lactate dehydrogenase M4 by these tissues was, to a large extent, saturable and the two dehydrogenases competitively inhibited each other's clearance. These results suggest that, also in mice, these enzymes are partly cleared from plasma by endocytosis by way of a common receptor on cells (probably macrophages) from liver, spleen and bone marrow. Morphometrical data showed that normal mouse liver contains 23 x 10(6) Kupffer cells/cm3. This number was reduced to about 30% of that of controls 24 hr after infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus but returned to normal within the next 9 days. The saturable component of uptake of lactate dehydrogenase M4 by liver, spleen and bone had disappeared 24 hr after infection with the virus, and did not return after the Kupffer cell population had recovered. Our findings suggest that lactate dehydrogenase M4 is, to a large extent, removed from the circulation by way of a receptor on a subpopulation of macrophages that is permissive for replication of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.",Virus_Diseases
"Collagen metabolism in cutis laxa fibroblasts: increased collagenase gene expression associated with unaltered expression of type I and type III collagen. Collagen metabolism was studied in cutis laxa by analyzing collagen and collagenase gene expression in three dermal fibroblast strains from patients with congenital cutis laxa and comparing them with fibroblasts obtained from age-matched healthy subjects. Normal collagen synthetic activity was observed in the cutis laxa fibroblasts. An increased level of collagenase mRNA and unaltered levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III) collagen mRNA were found in all cutis laxa cell strains by dot blot hybridization. Reduced levels of elastin mRNA were also detected in these strains. However, no qualitative differences in these mRNA transcripts were detected between the control and cutis laxa fibroblasts by Northern blot analysis. Collagenase activity in fibroblast culture supernatants was then measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled type I collagen. Increased collagenolytic activity in cutis laxa fibroblast culture supernatants was also found. These data suggest that increased collagenase expression of fibroblasts is related to the structural abnormality of dermal connective tissue in cutis laxa.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

The authors report two cases of localized herpetic lymphadenitis, both showing well-circumscribed areas of necrosis containing cells with diagnostic intranuclear inclusions. Electron microscopic studies in both cases revealed characteristic viral particles, and in situ hybridization studies using a herpes simplex genomic probe demonstrated HSV DNA in both specimens. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the cells containing the inclusions were stromal, not lymphoid, cells. Combining the current two cases with the six well-documented cases previously reported in the literature, seven of the eight cases of HSV lymphadenitis have developed in inguinal lymph nodes, with four occurring in patients with previously or subsequently diagnosed hematopoietic malignancies, including both patients in the current series.",Virus_Diseases
"Photopatch testing: the 5-year experience of the German, Austrian, and Swiss Photopatch Test Group. A cooperative photopatch test study was conducted by 45 dermatologic centers in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Results obtained from 1985 to 1990 are presented. A standard photopatch test tray of 32 substances was applied to the back of patients with suspected photosensivity. After applications for 24 hours, test sites were irradiated with 10 joules/cm2UVA. Unirradiated controls were included. Readings were performed immediately and 24, 48, and 72 hours after irradiation; responses were qualitatively graded on a 4-point scale. All data were stored and processed by a computer. With computer-assisted analysis of reaction patterns photoallergic reactions were identified and distinguished from phototoxic reactions. Data of 1129 patients were evaluated. Among a total of 2859 positive test reactions in 870 patients, 2041 in 778 patients were found to be photoinduced and 818 in 413 patients were contact reactions; 108 reactions in 83 patients were classified as photoallergic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disinfectants, sunscreens, phenothiazines, and fragrances caused most often photoallergic reactions. Many unspecific phototoxic reactions were induced by tiaprofenic acid, promethazine, carprofen, chlorpromazine, fenticolar, wood balsam of Peru, and perfumes. Despite the distinction between photoallergic and phototoxic responses, many test reactions lacked relevance for the patients' dermatoses.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Abnormal function of CD4+ helper/inducer T lymphocytes in a patient with widespread human papillomavirus type 3-related infection. Human papillomavirus-induced infections may be associated with cellular immunodeficiency. However, very little is known about the dysfunctional interactions among T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and antigen-presenting cells. A 30-year-old heterosexual man with a 10-year history of persistent multiple refractory flat wart lesions containing human papillomavirus type 3-related DNA sequence was studied. The patient had a severe depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and a compensatory increase in the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Impaired T-lymphocyte response to various stimuli was found. Depletion of the increased number of CD8+ T lymphocytes, which suppressed immunoglobulin production in vitro, did not restore the impaired T-lymphocyte response. Immobilized anti-CD3 beads that stimulate the T lymphocyte antigen complex in the absence of antigen-presenting cells indicated a T-lymphocyte defect, rather than a decreased antigen-presenting cell function. Thus, the pronounced cellular immunodeficiency was due to abnormal function of the CD4+ helper/inducer T lymphocytes.",Virus_Diseases
"Distribution of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viral antibody in Senegal: environmental and vectorial correlates. The spatial pattern in Senegal of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus IgG antibody prevalence in human and sheep was determined as was the relative abundance of potential tick vectors. A systematic, country-wide serological survey of sheep demonstrated that 10.4% of sheep exhibited IgG to CCHF virus. Sexes were infected equally. Antibody prevalence increased with age from 2.1% during the first year to 18.2% among sheep greater than or equal to 3 years of age. IgG prevalence was highest in the northern, arid Sahelian zone, averaging 75.7% seropositivity, and decreased to zero in the southern, moister Sudano-Guinean and Guinean zones. Human IgG prevalence ranged from 21% to less than 1% among the 8 sites that were sampled throughout the country, being greatest in the arid north and least in the south. Hyalomma ssp. ticks predominated in those biotopes where antibody prevalence was highest. The abundance of Hyalomma ticks may be the proximal determinant of endemic transmission.",Virus_Diseases

Of 210 patients, 78 (37%) had some degree of positive testing. A total of 31 patients (15%) were found to fulfill the definition of vulvar vestibulitis. A questionnaire was administered to these patients as well as to seven patients in whom vestibulitis had been previously diagnosed. A total of 50% had always had pain, most since their teenage years. Their history was not suggestive of a cyclic or remittent pattern of symptoms. Those with secondary dyspareunia or resolution of pain were usually either in a post partum phase or had group B streptococcus or human papillomavirus.

Four of these patients had cytomegalovirus infection. Other major diagnoses encountered included Down syndrome, trisomy 13 syndrome, neonatal asphyxia, non-immune hydrops, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Results of the study suggest a broader etiologic basis for linear areas of echogenicity in the basal ganglia and thalami of children than has previously been reported.

"Immunological and virological markers in individuals progressing from seroconversion to AIDS. Six men were selected from a large cohort of homosexual men participating in a study on HIV infection that was followed from seroconversion to AIDS. The patients were studied retrospectively for immunological functions of T cells, T-cell subset distribution and biological phenotype of HIV. A severe decrease in anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb)-induced T-cell proliferation at seroconversion was observed in two out of six men. After this acute phase, CD4+ T-cell numbers were in the normal range in the early asymptomatic period; the proliferative response was subnormal, whereas the capacity to generate cytotoxic T cells (CTL) was normal. From seroconversion on, CD4+CD29+ memory T-cell numbers were decreased to approximately 50% of normal values, which may contribute to loss of T-cell reactivity. In the asymptomatic phase only slow-replicating non-syncytium-inducing HIV variants were observed. The T-cell proliferative response further declined with the depletion of naive CD4+ CD45RA+ T cells and CD4+ T-cell numbers started to decline. This second decrease in T-cell function coincided with the emergence of more rapidly replicating, often (four out of six) syncytium-inducing variants. At diagnosis of AIDS, T-cell proliferation and CD4+ T-cell numbers were extremely low in five out of six patients and CTL function had declined in three out of five individuals tested. Circulating CD8+ cells had gradually shifted to an immature CD38+CD28- phenotype. Our findings support the theory that HIV-induced immune dysfunction allows for the emergence of virulent HIV variants associated with CD4+ cell loss and disease.",Virus_Diseases

Tests used include the polymerase chain reaction assay with three primer pairs (one in the gag region and two in the pol region) and tests for serum p24 antigen, anti-nef serology (Western blot), and five biologic markers frequently altered by HIV infection (CD4 lymphocyte count, serum beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin concentration, and serum IgG and IgA concentration). Although 91 of 92 HIV-1-seropositive persons were positive in testing with at least one primer pair, no positive result was observed in seronegative at-risk individuals or in 117 seronegative low-risk controls. No nef antibody was found in seronegative at-risk individuals or seronegative controls, but 44 (47%) of 92 HIV-1-seropositive persons had nef antibodies.

"Immunohistochemical analysis of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, Ki-67 antigen, and human papillomavirus DNA in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix. To investigate the relationship between the sex steroid receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]) status and the cell proliferation kinetics during the menstrual cycle in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix, immunohistochemical localization of ER, PR, and cell proliferation-associated antigen, Ki-67, was investigated in 35 normal cervical specimens, 3 condylomas, 26 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) samples, and 22 invasive squamous carcinoma samples. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was also studied. In the normal cervix, basal cells were usually ER positive, PR negative, and Ki-67 negative throughout the menstrual cycle. Parabasal cells were ER positive and PR negative in the follicular phase, but ER negative and PR positive, and Ki-67 positive in the luteal phase, and Ki-67-positive cells increased in number in the luteal phase. In contrast, PR positivity was observed in the cells of condyloma (2 of 2 cases), CIN (19 of 26 cases), and invasive squamous carcinoma (13 of 22 cases) irrespective of the menstrual phase. Moreover, most neoplastic cells containing HPV DNA type 16/18 were ER negative, whereas several lesions containing HPV DNA type 31/33/35 were weakly ER positive. Many Ki-67-labeled cells were observed in the neoplastic lesions. These results suggest that reduced ER expression and increased PR expression are associated with the proliferation of normal cervical squamous epithelium, and this proliferation-related receptor status, which is probably induced by HPV infection, is usually expressed in neoplastic cervical squamous cells.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Immunohistologic evaluation of the effect of cyclosporine treatment on the lichen planus immune infiltrate. We have investigated immunohistologically the cutaneous immune infiltrate in the lesions of five patients with severe, extensive lichen planus of recent onset before and after 15 days of oral, low-dose cyclosporine therapy (3 mg/kg/day). Before therapy, we observed an abnormal bandlike cellular infiltrate localized in the papillary dermis, composed mostly of CD3+ cells, with a prevalence of CD4+ cells. Infiltrating lymphocytes showed markers of activation (HLA-DR antigens and interleukin 2 receptor), and there were many Langerhans (CD1+) cells in the dermal infiltrate. After 15 days of cyclosporine therapy, we observed a dramatic decrease in the total number of T cells and a corresponding decrease in interleukin 2 receptor-positive activated CD25+ cells and in antigen-presenting cells (CD1+ and CD14b+). These changes were concurrent with clinical improvement. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that the inhibition of CD4 T cells by cyclosporine might explain the drug's therapeutic action and that the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and CD4 T cells is important in the pathogenesis of lichen planus.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Insulin effects on glucose and potassium metabolism in vivo: evidence for selective insulin resistance in humans. The effects of insulin on in vivo glucose use and potassium uptake in healthy humans are well documented. However, the interrelationship between these two processes is not fully defined. In order to characterize it, we have used the euglycemic clamp technique on six normal volunteers, two patients with acanthosis nigricans and insulin resistance (AN), and one patient with idiopathic nonazotemic hyperkalemia (HK). In the basal state, all patients had normal fasting blood sugar, the AN patients had fasting hyperinsulinemia (600% of controls), and the HK patient had an elevated plasma potassium level of 5.1 mmol/L (n = 4.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/L). During low dose (1 mU/kg.min), and high dose (10 mU/kg.min) insulin infusions, normals used glucose at a rate of 220 +/- 10 and 470 +/- 20 mg/M2.min, respectively. The HK patient had a normal glucose use at both infusion rates, but the AN patients had a 20% decrease of glucose use compared to normals at the two infusion rates. In normal patients, plasma potassium fell by 0.7 and 1.4 mmol/L at the end of the two infusion periods, respectively. AN patients had a similar fall in potassium, but the HK patient displayed no change in plasma potassium levels during a low dose insulin infusion, and only a 0.6 mmol/L drop during the high dose insulin infusion. These results indicate that: 1) patients with AN are resistant to insulin action on glucose use, 2) AN patients have a normal response to insulin on potassium uptake, 3) HK is a patient with normal response to insulin on glucose use, and 4) this patient is resistant to insulin action on potassium uptake. In conclusion: 1) we have demonstrated the independence of insulin action on glucose and potassium uptake in vivo, 2) we documented the existence of selective insulin resistance in the above patients, 3) we speculate, that in patients with a normal response to insulin on one parameter of its actions, and subnormal response on another parameter, a postreceptor defect rather than a receptor abnormality must exist.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

A retrospective study of 643 cutaneous horns examined in our department between 1970 and 1989 revealed that 38.9% were derived from malignant or premalignant epidermal lesions, and 61.1% from benign lesions. Four main features were associated with premalignant or malignant histopathological change at the base of a cutaneous horn (base pathology). These were: (i) age--the mean age of the patients whose cutaneous horns showed premalignant or malignant base pathology was 8.9 years greater than the mean age of the patients where base pathology was benign (P less than 0.0005); (ii) sex--males were more likely to develop a cutaneous horn with (pre)malignant base pathology (P less than 0.001); (iii) site--over 70% of all (pre)malignant lesions were found on the nose, pinnae, backs of hands, scalp, forearms and the face; a cutaneous horn found at these sites was 2.1 times more likely to have derived from a (pre)malignant base than from any other part of the body (P less than 0.0001); (iv) geometry of the lesion--lesions with a wide base or a low height-to-base ratio were significantly more likely to show (pre)malignant base pathology. Of those solar keratoses giving rise to cutaneous horns, 8.9% also showed histological evidence of change to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); this figure was not significantly different from the 6.2% of solar keratoses without horns that showed SCC change during the same period (1970-89).",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Long-term combined rIFN-alpha-2a and zidovudine therapy for HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma: clinical consequences and side effects. Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has been shown to be effective in treating HIV-associated KS in at least 30% of patients, and Zidovudine has proved beneficial for AIDS patients. Moreover, both drugs have demonstrated an inhibitory effect on HIV replication. Based on the above, we combined IFN-alpha and zidovudine for treatment of HIV-associated KS in order to evaluate tolerance and clinical efficacy. Twenty-one homosexual men with histologically proved HIV-associated KS were treated in an open trial with rIFN-alpha-2a 18 X 10(6) IU every second day and zidovudine 800-1200 mg/d. Treatment was discontinued within the first month in six patients: three of them developed subjective intolerance, and three others contracted severe opportunistic infections or HIV-cachexia. Fifteen evaluable patients received combination treatment over a period of 2-20 months (average 10 months). The dosage was reduced as required based on drug-induced cytotoxicity. Complete remission was observed in four patients, partial remission in three, stable disease in two, and progression in six, resulting in an overall response rate of 46%. Negative p24 expression prior to treatment was a positive predictor. Although extracutaneous involvement had a negative influence on tumor remission, even patients with a mean initial T-helper cell count below 100 mm3 responded positively. In conclusion, combination therapy of rIFN-alpha-2a with AZT may effectively control HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma in more than 40% of patients. In contrast to monotherapy with IFN-alpha, patients with severely reduced immune systems will also benefit from combined treatment.",Virus_Diseases
"Recovery of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 from semen: minimal impact of stage of infection and current antiviral chemotherapy. Because exposure to semen is important for the sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV), the relationship of stage of infection and antiviral chemotherapy to isolation of HIV from semen was investigated. Whereas HIV was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all seropositive persons tested, it was isolated from semen in only 11 (32%) of 34 men, including 3 of 6 who were studied sequentially over time. HIV was isolated from 6 (32%) of 19 semen specimens from 14 asymptomatic persons (Centers for Disease Control [CDC] class II or III) and from 10 (28%) of 36 semen specimens from 20 symptomatic patients (CDC class IV). Isolation of HIV from semen did not correlate with CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes counts or zidovudine therapy. Seropositive men may shed HIV in semen early in the course of infection, and zidovudine therapy seems to have no effect on the recovery of HIV and, thus, on the potential for sexual transmission of HIV.",Virus_Diseases

"Circulating CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for HTLV-I pX in patients with HTLV-I associated neurological disease. The human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), the first human retrovirus to be characterized, is associated with adult T-cell leukaemia and a chronic progressive disease of the central nervous system termed tropical spastic paraparesis, or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. Only 1% of individuals infected with HTLV-I develop clinical disease however. The various manifestations of an HTLV-I infection may be related to differences in the genetic backgrounds of individuals, infection with variant strains of HTLV-I, differences in viral tropism or host immune response to the virus. Whereas the humoral response to HTLV-I is well characterized, little is known about the human cellular immune response, such as the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here we report the presence of high levels of circulating HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in patients with HTLV-I associated neurological disease but not in HTLV-I seropositive individuals without neurological involvement. These cytotoxic T lymphocytes are CD8+, HLA class I- restricted and predominantly recognize the HTLV-I gene products encoded in the regulatory region pX.

"Urticaria: clinical efficacy of cetirizine in comparison with hydroxyzine and placebo. Chronic urticaria is a problem for both physician and patient. In an effort to avoid the risks associated with corticosteroid treatment, many first-generation H1-receptor antagonists have been tried and found to induce undesirable levels of sedation when given in amounts sufficient to control urticaria. Cetirizine, a pharmacologically active oxidized metabolite of hydroxyzine, was developed to provide selective H1-receptor inhibition without depression of the central nervous system. In a 4-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy study, cetirizine, in a once-a-day dose (5 to 20 mg), was equivalent in efficacy to hydroxyzine in divided doses (25 to 75 mg/day). The incidence of somnolence in the cetirizine group was not significantly different from that of the placebo group. However, in the hydroxyzine group, the incidence of somnolence was significantly higher than that in the placebo group (p = 0.001). The results of this study demonstrate that cetirizine has a greater safety margin over the older parent drug hydroxyzine.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Productive human immunodeficiency virus infection levels correlate with AIDS-related manifestations in the patient. Mononuclear cells were obtained from 71 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive subjects presenting and first visit either as asymptomatic or with minor symptoms and with CD4 lymphocytes greater than 550 per mm3 (group A, 35 patients) or as patients with AIDS, AIDS-related illnesses, or CD4 lymphocytes less than 400 per mm3 (group B, 36 patients). After 1-5 years of follow-up, 13 patients of group A had essentially retained their initial status (asymptomatics); the 22 others had suffered clinical or immunological deterioration (progressors). Frozen cells were thawed and submitted to lethal gamma-irradiation in vitro (4500 rads; 1 rad = 0.01 Gy) before they were cultured with normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes to determine radiation-resistant HIV expression ex vivo (R-HEV). HIV antigenemia correlated with R-HEV values in 142 samples (r = 0.92, P less than 0.001) but was a less sensitive predictor of disease than R-HEV. R-HEV was detected in all specimens from patients with major AIDS-related illnesses or HIV-associated CD4 lymphopenia. In 77% of the progressors from group A, R-HEV detection preceded the onset of AIDS-associated disease or CD4 lymphopenia by 1 year (average). Conversely, R-HEV was low or was not detected in 36 sequential specimens from the 13 patients who remained asymptomatic over the following 2-5 years. Thus, persistently low HIV expression in vivo predicted a nondiseased state, whereas higher HIV expression levels seemed necessary for disease to occur. These data indicate that R-HEV is related to productive HIV infection in vivo, the latter acting as a determinant of AIDS-related illnesses. In view of this, measurement of HIV expression levels in the patient should be useful in antiviral efficacy trials.",Virus_Diseases
"Cyclosporine A in the treatment of psoriasis: a clinical and mechanistic perspective. Cyclosporine A, a unique immunomodulatory agent, has been used increasingly over the last 5 years in the management of severe psoriasis. The remarkable efficacy of this drug coupled with its known immunosuppressive properties have enabled a further appreciation of the role of the immune system in the induction and maintenance of psoriatic plaques. Although acting primarily on T lymphocytes, there is also evidence for an effect of cyclosporine A on other constitutive cell types within the skin. The future use of systemically administered cyclosporine A in the treatment of psoriasis and other cutaneous diseases is dependent on the successful balance of efficacy and side-effect profile; namely, the dose-related problems of hypertension and nephrotoxicity. As a result of the toxicity encountered with systemically administered cyclosporine A, attempts to formulate a successful topical preparation for use in cutaneous disease are being made. The advent of cyclosporine A provides the dermatologist with a new therapeutic strategem in the management of psoriasis, although the long-term safety of such interventional therapy remains to be discerned.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Vaccine protection of rhesus macaques against simian immunodeficiency virus infection. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) immunized with an inactivated whole SIVmac vaccine and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), or aqueous suspension were challenged intravenously with 0.1 TCID50 of cell-free SIVmac. Whereas virus was readily recovered from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 10 of 10 nonvaccinated controls following this challenge dose, virus was not recovered from the three animals that received the vaccine with MDP nor from one of two animals that received the vaccine with IFA and one of three animals that received the aqueous vaccine. The animals that were protected against challenge were those that had detectable SIV antibody response to the envelop, both the outer glycoprotein (gp120) and the truncated transmembrane glycoprotein (gp31). Protected monkeys tended to have higher titers of syncytial inhibition antibody prior to challenge. An anamnestic response after challenge was observed only in the vaccinated monkeys that became infected. Vaccinated animals that became challenge-infected tended to live longer than infected controls. These results confirm those at two other primate centers and indicate that killed whole SIV vaccines can protect against low challenge doses of SIV and prevent early death in those monkeys that do become infected. The mechanism of this protection remains undetermined. This finding adds optimism to the possibility of an eventual AIDS vaccine.",Virus_Diseases
"Treatment of alopecia areata with diphenylcyclopropenone. One hundred thirty-nine patients with severe alopecia areata (the majority with the subtotal, total, or universalis type) were treated with topical immunotherapy (diphenylcyclopropenone). Patients were initially treated unilaterally; the other side of the scalp served as a control. In 50.4% of the patients the response was either excellent (total regrowth) or satisfactory (subtotal regrowth with only a few remaining bald patches). The most frequent side effects were eczematous reactions with blistering, spreading of the induced contact eczema, and sleep disturbances.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Tissue expansion in the treatment of pressure ulcers. The authors report their experience using skin expanders in 11 patients with severe bed sores. The expanders, with different volumes, from 250 to 1000 cc, were generally overfilled using the cutaneous tonometer. In fact, with the information revealed by this apparatus on the skin in expansion, the authors were able to reduce the filling intervals without risking ulceration. In their experience, the results obtained were satisfactory: All patients treated achieved surgical recovery. The authors see a wide future for skin-expander use in pressure-ulcer treatment. They have a working hypothesis about using expanders to progressively advance sensitive skin in areas subject to ulceration. This hypothesis is based on the possibility of reexpanding the same flap several times, as has been seen in the treatment of other types of pathology.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Treatment of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with double lung transplantation. Six patients with end-stage emphysema (age 44 +/- 2 years) underwent double lung transplantation (Tx) from June 1988 through May 1990. All suffered from severe inanition and required oxygen therapy. The ischemic time was 193 +/- 28 minutes. Post-Tx immune suppression was OKT3 (14 days), cyclosporine (trough levels of 150 +/- 25 ng/ml), azathioprine to keep WBC at 3,000 to 5,000/cu mm (1 to 3.0 mg/kg/day) and following OKT3, a tapering prednisone regimen. Two rejection episodes that occurred in two patients on post-Tx day 5 and 10 were treated with bolus doses of methylprednisolone. The mean hospital stay was 32 +/- 7 days (range, 20 to 69 days). Four patients required treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection: gastritis (+donor, +recipient) in one and CMV pneumonia in two (+donor, -recipient). A fourth (+donor, -recipient) had right-sided Candida empyema six weeks post-Tx, developed CMV and staphylococcal sepsis, and died 64 days post-Tx. One patient required pyloroplasty eight weeks post-Tx and one patient underwent tracheal suture line repair at eight weeks. During a follow-up of 81 patients months (range, 8 to 24 months), one patient had developed Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) induced lymphoproliferative disease in the lung and one patient had developed EBV lymphoma. Three patients are at work, one is continuing rehabilitation, and one is at home. Double lung Tx offers a definitive benefit to patients with emphysema; however, a prolonged postoperative course can be expected. Viral infections remain serious but treatable problems.",Virus_Diseases

"Effect of PUVA on immunologic and virologic findings in HIV-infected patients. Psoralen and UVA radiation inactivate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro whereas UVB and UVC radiation under experimental conditions transactivate HIV. We studied the effect of systemic PUVA treatment on immunologic and virologic findings in five HIV-infected patients. Systemic PUVA was given in two-4-week periods, 2 months apart. The total irradiation ranged from 30 to 262 joules/cm2. All skin lesions, including therapy-resistant psoriasis vulgaris, seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis, and chronic urticaria, cleared during the first weeks of PUVA. A slight increase in the CD4 lymphocyte numbers was seen in two patients. Serum beta 2-microglobulin values and urine neopterin values remained steady, and the elevated serum immunoglobulin values became normal in all patients. The PUVA treatment did not induce appearance of HIV antigen in serum and HIV isolation was repeatedly negative in all patients whose cultures were initially negative. Lymphocyte recall responses to purified protein derivative (tuberculin) became positive in three and to HIV-specific antigens in two patients. These responses, however, were transient. All patients except one, who was positive for HIV antigen at entry, have remained well 1 year after PUVA therapy.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Low incidence of non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis in London confirmed by hepatitis C virus serology  To see whether the introduction of screening tests for post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) in the UK would be worth while, the incidence of such hepatitis was assessed among patients receiving blood during operations at five hospitals served by the North London Blood Transfusion Centre. 387 patients, who each received blood or blood components from an average of 3 donors were followed up prospectively and blood samples were taken every 2 weeks for 3 months and then each month for a further 3 months. 229 patients also provided a sample at 12 months. All available patient and donor samples were tested for alanine aminotransferase concentrations and for antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) by ELISA. Repeatedly anti-HCV positive samples were submitted to supplementary HCV assays. 1 of the 387 patients showed biochemical evidence of acute post-transfusion NANBH after exclusion of non-viral causes. Anti-HCV developed in this patient and the seroconversion was confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay and polymerase chain reaction. Serum from 1 of the 8 donors whose blood he received was positive for anti-HCV by all three methods. In another patient HCV seroconversion was shown by ELISA but alanine aminotransferase concentrations remained normal throughout follow-up. His samples and those of his 2 donors were negative for HCV by the polymerase chain reaction. A third patient showed rises in alanine aminotransferase compatible with post-transfusion NANBH, but serology and polymerase chain reaction assays for HCV were negative for her samples and those of her donors. Anti-HCV reactivity likely to be false positive (negative by both confirmatory tests and no adverse effects in recipients) was seen in 6 of 1283 donors. This study, despite its being carried out in the part of the UK with the highest frequency of infectious markers in blood donations, has shown a very low incidence of post-transfusion NANBH.",Virus_Diseases
"Coincidental hemochromatosis and viral hepatitis. A 35-year-old woman presented with liver failure, hepatic iron overload, and secondary amenorrhea due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. She had chronic inflammatory hepatitis which was considered to be due to post-transfusional viral hepatitis. Her hepatic iron overload was considered to be due to hemochromatosis. Her premature menopause was thought to be due to the severity of her liver disease, but her iron overload also could have contributed to gonadotrophin deficiency. She underwent liver transplantation and 5 months later, she experienced return of menstrual function. The distinction between hepatitis as a cause of iron loading, hemochromatosis as a cause of hepatic inflammation, the small influence of alcohol on increased iron stores, and other features of her history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation are discussed.",Virus_Diseases
"Treatment of pruritus of primary biliary cirrhosis with rifampin. Pruritus can be a debilitating symptom in patients with chronic cholestasis. Based on previous reports of its efficacy, we evaluated the impact of rifampin on the pruritus associated with primary biliary cirrhosis. Fourteen patients were included in a randomized, crossover study. After a 15-day washout period, subjects were followed for three weeks. During the first and third week, patients received 600 mg of rifampin or placebo; no treatment was administered during the second week. Pruritus was subjectively scored on a scale from 0 to 100. With rifampin, pruritus disappeared in 11 patients and partially improved in three; with placebo, only two had a partial response (P less than 0.001). Six patients with a prior poor or no response to cholestyramine improved with rifampin. No changes in biochemical tests or side effects were observed during this period. We conclude that short-term administration of rifampin relieves pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis. When administered over a period of eight months in an open study, the relief of pruritus was maintained, while one individual developed an allergic reaction. Rifampin appears to be a safe drug in the management of the pruritus of primary biliary cirrhosis.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"The interspinous method of posterior atlantoaxial arthrodesis. Thirty-six patients underwent C1-2 posterior wiring and fusion procedures over a 5-year period for unstable C-2 fractures (eight cases), unstable atlas-axis combination fractures (six cases), rheumatoid C1-2 instability (14 cases), os odontoideum (four cases), traumatic C1-2 ligamentous instability (three cases), or instability secondary to a C-2 tumor (one case). In each case, the atlantoaxial arthrodesis utilized sublaminar wire at C-1 and incorporated an iliac-crest strut-graft positioned between the posterior arches of C-1 and C-2, held in place by securing wire around the base of the spinous process of the axis. Follow-up examination was performed in all patients after a mean postoperative duration of 33.7 months.

"Cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in systemic sclerosis and response to nifedipine and captopril. PURPOSE: This prospective study was performed to evaluate the response of the cardiopulmonary vasculature to two vasodilators in patients with systemic sclerosis and either minimal or no central hemodynamic abnormalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon (19 of 20 patients), and clinically normal cardiac function underwent right heart catheterization. Rest and exercise hemodynamic measurements, including cardiac output by thermodilution, were performed before and after oral administration of nifedipine 20 mg and captopril 25 mg. RESULTS: Half of the patients had normal hemodynamics (Group A); the other half (Group B) had abnormal baseline elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance and four of them showed ""borderline"" pulmonary arterial hypertension. Group A, with significantly shorter disease duration compared with Group B, responded poorly to nifedipine and captopril. However, Group B had significant decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance (from 148 +/- 20 to normal levels of 94 +/- 21 dynes.second.cm-5) and pulmonary mean pressure in response to nifedipine treatment but not to captopril. CONCLUSION: These observations show a short-term beneficial effect of nifedipine in the cardiopulmonary vasculature of patients with systemic sclerosis and suggest that a potentially reversible vasoconstrictive element is included in the vascular lesion of this disorder.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
"Androgen replacement therapy in male patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A hypogonadic condition characterized by low serum testosterone levels has been identified in male patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Seven men with active RA were treated daily for 6 months with oral testosterone undecanoate plus a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug in an attempt to evaluate the immunologic response, the overall clinical response, and the sex hormone response to such replacement therapy. At the end of the 6 months, there was a significant increase in serum testosterone levels (P less than 0.05), an increase in the number of CD8+ T cells, and a decrease in the CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratio. The IgM rheumatoid factor concentration decreased significantly (P less than 0.05). There was a concurrent significant reduction in the number of affected joints (P less than 0.05) and in the daily intake of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (P less than 0.01). The well-known immunosuppressive action of androgens probably contributed to our findings in these RA patients.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases

"Expression of cytokine receptors and markers of differentiation in human papillomavirus-infected cervical tissues. Human papillomavirus infection of the uterine cervix is associated with a spectrum of benign, premalignant, and malignant epithelial lesions, a process that appears to require the coordinated effects of secondary cellular and environmental events. We have used flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of the cellular markers for proliferation (interleukin-1, epidermal growth factor receptor, and transferrin receptor) and the markers of cellular differentiation (filaggrin and low-molecular-weight cytokeratin) in normal and human papillomavirus--infected human cervical tissues representing the natural range of human papillomavirus--induced disease. The results were correlated with the histologic grade of disease, human papillomavirus type, cellular deoxyribonucleic acid content, and cell cycle status. Interleukin-1 and transferrin receptor were slightly increased in high-grade dysplasias and in squamous cell carcinomas. Filaggrin expression was found to be inversely related and cytokeratin and epidermal growth factor receptor expression directly related to the degree of neoplasia. These findings indicate that cytokeratin and epidermal growth factor receptor are useful markers of cell proliferation in human papillomavirus--infected tissues and that their expression may directly increase as a result of infection.",Virus_Diseases

"Quantitative analysis of HIV-1 proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with AIDS or ARC: decrease of proviral DNA content following treatment with 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI). A rapid and simple method for determining the proviral DNA content in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) from patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was established by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. We found that the majority of HIV proviral DNA copies detectable in unfractionated PBM resided in T cells, while B cells/monocytes contained lesser amounts of HIV DNA (93.9 +/- 3.5% for T cells vs. 6.1 +/- 3.5% for B cells/monocytes: p less than 0.05). When we compared the amount of HIV proviral DNA in PBM from 13 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) before and during antiretroviral therapy with 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) which was given as an escalating dose in a Phase I clinical study, a significant decrease was observed in 9 of 12 evaluable patients receiving the drug for 8 to 14 weeks (p less than 0.02). The decrease appeared more pronounced in patients receiving relatively high doses of the drug. These data suggest that the quantitation of HIV viral DNA in PBM by PCR is feasible and may theoretically contribute to an overall monitoring of patients receiving experimental therapy. However, larger studies will be required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this assay and further longitudinal studies will be essential.",Virus_Diseases
"Interstitial lung disease. The interstitial lung diseases are comprised of a group of pulmonary disorders characterized clinically by diffuse infiltrates on the chest radiograph and histologically by distortion of the gas exchanging portion of the lung. The physiologic correlates are restriction of lung volumes and impaired oxygenation. The term ""interstitial"" when applied to these diseases is actually a misnomer because it implies that the inflammatory process is limited specifically to the area between the alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial basement membranes. The diseases currently grouped as ""interstitial"" also frequently involve the alveolar epithelium, alveolar space, pulmonary microvasculature, and less commonly, the respiratory bronchioles, larger airways, and even the pleura. The enormous differential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease can be made manageable by understanding that pneumoconiosis, drug-induced disease, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis account for over 80% of the responsible entities and can usually be identified from the patient's history. The nine remaining diseases/disease categories include: sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia, histiocytosis X, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease, granulomatous vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, lymphomatoid granulomatosis), Goodpasture's syndrome, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The diagnosis of a specific interstitial lung disease can be made via various means including the patient's history, specific serologies, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, and biopsy of extrathoracic tissues or open lung biopsy. A directed diagnostic approach can be formulated based on an understanding of these techniques and a thorough knowledge of the clinical presentations and specific diagnostic criteria for each of the major diseases. This monograph will serve as a guide for the clinician to use in evaluating and treating patients with interstitial lung disease. We begin by reviewing the clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and management of specific interstitial lung diseases excluding pulmonary infection, neoplasm, and sarcoidosis. Pneumoconiosis and drug-induced syndromes are not discussed in detail, but the agents responsible and pertinent exposures are presented in tabular form in the discussion of the general diagnostic approach.",Skin_and_Connective_Tissue_Diseases
